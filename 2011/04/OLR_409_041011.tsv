9978	12241	Sky, and Loki!
13882	18788	Tonight, April 10th, 2011, has the 3DS sold up to expectations in Japan?
19168	24154	A new Sonic game is revealed, and after many years, a Fan Streets of Rage remake is released.
31343	38487	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38607	44870	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
45511	51154	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51434	54876	Rob has renewed my faith in computing.
55197	55657	How's that?
56557	58959	By giving me a task of revival.
59700	62562	You're going to CPR on one of my dead computers, yeah.
62762	67725	Because I've needed... I've been going through this dilemma where I can't get Maya working on my computer.
68546	70767	And I'm going to put Windows 7 and dual boot Linux on it.
70947	71127	Right.
71427	74129	But in the meantime, I was like, I still really want a Mac.
74570	74690	So...
75350	76431	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
97941	101722	Also with us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's joining us.
102162	102402	Hello.
102542	103562	And at least he has chicken.
104542	104782	Yes.
105423	106123	How you doing, Loki?
106143	106783	How are things for you?
107423	108303	I'm doing fine.
108483	108703	Yeah?
109083	112804	Just hands are sticky, so I'm trying to figure out how to hold the microphone without, you know.
113164	114925	All right, I'll leave you alone so you can finish chicken.
115525	118625	It's just a radio program we do pretty consistently every week here at 6 o'clock.
118665	119085	You know what?
119646	120606	Here's your trivia for the night.
120686	120986	What's that?
121346	126167	Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones album, had a zipper on the thing and also had a guy with a boner on it.
126867	127127	What?
127708	132970	Seriously, the album, it has like a shot of a guy's crotch and it had a zipper on it where you can unzip the jeans.
133731	135892	But the guy had a big boner when they took the picture.
136672	138453	How nice that is.
138513	139574	And it was sticky fingers.
140074	140274	Right.
140694	142315	So, there's your trivia.
142515	146839	We're going to get into our gaming weeks, but nobody else is in the studio tonight, just the three of us here.
147240	148461	You guys, though, are joining us.
148601	150483	Always the fourth guest with us, our chat room.
150543	155148	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat with us live, as we do tape live on this Sunday night.
155708	157891	Just kind of like a live note or whatever.
158411	161774	We're really delayed or what have you on the feed.
161854	162514	I don't know what's up.
162574	167138	It's like two to three minutes behind when we say something and when you guys see it.
167238	170700	So you'll have to forgive us a little bit if we're going back to story.
170720	173703	Because we want to make sure the chat has a chance to get feedback on stories.
174063	175844	We may have to go back a little bit to do that.
175964	180248	I don't know why things are so – well, I do know why things are so delayed, but it's nothing we can really fix sadly.
180848	182309	So we're just going to have to deal with it.
182369	182749	Yay.
183390	187613	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games you've been playing this week.
188253	189654	Always a nice conversation starter.
189674	190915	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
192356	196378	For the record, I just posted a picture of the album cover with the boner.
197259	197559	Thank you.
197579	198560	I played a little Dragon Age 2.
199540	203443	I am finally into the second act and totally enjoying the game.
203963	207606	I've given up on my lesbian love because Fenris showed up.
208286	210048	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
228068	230850	and then I could totally sleep with Isabella anytime I want to because she's a slut.
233152	255867	Then I we're actually going to be getting back into playing Final Fantasy, Dan and I are, but we did not start yet because he just got back on Wednesday and I'm playing World of Warcraft of course and I am almost at Exalted with the stupid drunken dwarves and I don't have to do the stupid motion sickness inducing drunken quest again.
256747	257328	Hopefully soon.
258289	259730	You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?
260030	264295	Where you have to drink ten things of ale and then you get all the fuzzy effects and everything.
264855	267898	And I'm like, motion sick, it makes me want to puke every time I do it.
268239	272203	Yeah, it's pretty... You gotta be careful with that because it even messes me up.
272283	274825	I still refuse to do the beer run for the record because it's fucking annoying.
275105	280431	But I finally got exalted with kiddie people and have badass shoes and a camel.
281075	281755	Oh My God Shoes
311815	312035	Done.
313155	316217	Alright, Loki, if you're done with your chicken, tell us about your gaming week.
316777	318878	I didn't play a whole lot.
319459	321880	Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, as usual.
323241	326162	Other than Grand Theft Auto, I played a little bit of Game Dev Story.
326862	327903	Just very briefly.
327923	329244	A little bit of Reraive.
331185	333666	Downloaded the new song packs just for the hell of it.
334707	335487	And that was kind of fun.
336527	336828	And then...
339654	343237	Actually, some Excitebots last night until the Wii broke.
345279	346259	But it was fun.
347400	348001	It'll be fixed soon.
348021	350843	Yeah, you were telling me when you came in here, like, well, I broke my Wii last night.
350883	352404	And I said, well, the good news is it's just a Wii.
353565	354146	Yeah, it's true.
354246	355927	And we haven't played that in a long time.
356968	359550	It's kind of sad, though, because I was looking forward to playing some more stuff on there.
360250	362332	But it'll be fixed soon.
362432	363013	It's not a big deal.
364153	367576	It's just inconvenient right now that I have to lose my progress.
367596	368497	It's only a flesh wound.
369446	373991	We ain't been so much out of Excitebots for the longest time.
375193	380179	It's kind of a learning curve to get back in and remember how to be so kick-ass at it.
381701	383063	But it's still fun.
384710	392395	So there's a question for DarkSakura in our chatroom from, and I know this person has this name just to get me to read it, but it's from iFarTed.
393116	396378	It says, DarkSakura, a question in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
396658	400821	Would you recommend Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 to someone that's moderately into MMOs?
401109	403091	Well, my answer was, I like DA2.
403131	404773	I haven't played DAO, honestly.
408096	409918	It doesn't really have a feel of an MMO.
409978	412180	It just has a feel of a fun kind of adventure game.
412860	415603	So, I'd recommend it to anybody.
415723	416704	It's pretty fun.
416844	424712	I mean, if the type of running around and picking up clues and doing quests in different parts of towns is not your cup of tea, then go get your coffee elsewhere.
425971	427472	MMOs are so diverse too.
427593	428813	It's really hard to say.
429214	440343	People that are into WoW may not necessarily be into DC Universe Online.
440523	442104	MMOs are a pretty vast market now.
442524	449069	Every time I start to get just a little bit bored with Dragon Age 2, one of the characters will say something so hilarious that I keep laughing.
449950	453813	and then I found the experience cheat.
454033	458496	Well, it's more like a glitch in the game where you can get infinite experience and gold which really helped.
458876	459977	So now I really like the game.
460877	461337	There you go.
461357	462218	Well, I didn't find it.
462358	467882	Tiara told me about it but then I did it by accident because I wasn't really going to do it except I managed to get the right spots.
467902	469543	I was like, maybe I will.
469563	469903	A button.
473185	475666	We also have a blast from the past in our chat room tonight.
476026	477646	Check this out, DDR Angels in chat.
477666	480027	I don't think I've seen her in chat since like episode 130?
480547	482028	Maybe no, it's probably later than that, but still.
482768	485469	So DDR Angels in chat saying, you can turn the drunk effect off.
485969	486749	I actually never knew that.
487269	488290	I don't doubt that that's not true.
488310	490070	You can set down your graphic settings to do it.
490790	493091	Yeah, there's probably a way you can just go in and turn it off.
493111	495432	I'm lazy, and honestly... I never knew either.
495692	498433	I just always thought the way to not get the effects to do that, don't drink.
498673	499533	It's just like real life.
499915	500655	Wild Hammer Wild the Dailies
524602	527524	Yeah, but I don't do the beer run because I hate that one.
527984	528905	So I just refuse to do it.
529065	531146	I hate the Wildhammer quest, but that's a talk for another show.
531246	531407	Yes.
531607	531847	All right.
532687	533268	Sorry, Loki.
533528	539872	I don't think you were quite done with your gaming week because I see you've opened up this little... You've opened up your package that you brought with you.
540473	540873	Of course.
541513	548078	No, this week, as kind of a random thing, we had guests, celebrity guests at my work.
548778	548958	So...
550379	555602	Out of, I don't know, just trying to be funny, I guess, I had them sign my 360.
556422	559124	So I have my JTAG 360, by the way.
561065	567248	I have it signed by Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher, what was it?
567428	569689	I'm trying to remember his last name now.
570229	572331	That was the lowest build of the three.
572891	573011	Yeah.
573031	573131	Yeah.
574881	576862	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
576882	577602	Oh, Christopher Thornton.
577622	580723	It's going up on the OLR thing now.
580843	582143	Yeah, somebody posted the video.
582483	585024	We had a little video stumble on our site.
585084	591386	I think somebody found the, one of our authors found the video that you posted on YouTube where you're like, hi.
591826	595767	Well, we have guests here today and I didn't have anything for them to sign.
596687	597707	So I brought my Xbox 360.
598027	599648	I could have used it.
599848	601588	I printed out a picture, but why do that?
601608	603729	That's not as cool.
603769	605009	My favorite is what the guy says.
605069	605329	Hold on.
605630	607810	I feel embarrassed.
607910	609891	It's a hard rhyme.
610411	612271	I don't have anything to sign other than this.
612412	614252	That's cool.
614332	615412	Awesome.
615572	618013	That's Orlando Bloom, by the way, that doesn't know what the thing is.
618973	620274	I've never signed an Xbox.
620834	621334	Yeah.
621434	621854	Who to?
622934	623175	Matt.
623475	623695	Matt?
623875	624075	Yeah.
625382	627164	Matt, play hard.
627585	629507	That's what he signed it as, Matt, play hard.
629527	631069	Yeah, that's good.
631970	633452	That's awesome.
633492	634173	Thank you, Matt.
634453	636536	It's poorly filmed because I had to hold the Xbox.
636656	638038	My favorite is the part coming up.
638058	638378	Nice.
638398	640040	Is that the one with the Blu-ray?
640541	641863	Is that the one with the Blu-ray?
641923	642864	No, just DVDs.
644926	649031	HD DVDs.
649111	650372	Actors are real people too.
650392	651253	It's cool.
651293	652134	He's busy.
653035	656339	If you like, I have Spray Fixative.
657680	658281	So it won't come off?
659502	660824	I don't think it's going to come off anyways.
661141	664444	Well, I've had stuff come off of plastic before.
664944	665705	Don't wash it.
666065	667066	I'm not going to wash it.
667446	670929	No, I have a ton of signed posters and stuff by different celebrities coming in.
671409	672870	Not big celebrities.
673791	674111	A couple.
674151	678295	We've had like, I'm trying to think of some of the people we had.
678315	682698	Yeah, not really big celebrities.
682778	687442	But my posters are sitting under a sack of magazines at my desk.
688001	691023	This goes with me to and from work all the time.
691503	693964	So that is a higher honor for them.
694804	696165	All the more reason to have some fixative.
698326	699587	I'm moving this week.
699627	701248	It's something big I'm doing right now, obviously.
701408	703189	And I found some of my autographed pictures.
703549	708872	And one of the autographed pictures I found the other day was the autographed picture of Scott Wolf from Party of Five.
709092	710012	You got me.
710272	710692	That's right.
710712	712593	I remember that now.
712653	713194	Scott Wolf.
713714	715955	Now he's on V. He is so tiny.
716415	716976	Yeah.
718817	719577	But so dreamy.
719897	726661	No, they were actually really cool because most of the celebrities we have don't really make their appearance and go.
727202	735346	They're just all chilling in the audience with different people and just chatting up people and talking about movies and that kind of stuff.
735947	736407	It was really cool.
738112	742795	It was for a movie called Sympathy for Delicious, I think is what it was.
743476	743916	Something like that.
744817	745337	Sounds yummy.
746098	748399	It's kind of cool.
749780	752422	So, yeah, I don't know.
752702	753303	It's just kind of funny.
754103	758086	So this must be worth $3 million if the Sarah Palin one's worth $1 million.
758607	761148	There was a Sarah Palin Xbox worth $1 million?
761168	762089	Well, it's not worth $1 million.
762690	764351	It's put up on eBay for $1 million.
764431	765111	I see.
765431	766052	No one's going to buy it.
766972	768613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794153	799495	I think my most treasured autograph is my Paula Abdul autograph from the Under My Spell tour.
800195	803497	This is way before she was crazy on pills on American Idol.
803557	804337	Actually, I take that back.
804797	814041	My greatest legitimate autograph is Yoko Kanno who did Macross Plus and Escaflowne and all that.
814881	818743	We've got her signing one of our Macross Plus CDs.
819023	820484	Well, I'm going to keep having people sign it.
820504	821144	To dance on.
822571	823151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
844602	845923	It took up the entire page.
846323	850986	To Rob, if you want to get laid, climb up a chicken's ass and wait.
851406	852587	Love, asshole.
853047	853828	But his real name.
854308	855489	And it took up the entire page.
856509	857070	What an ass.
858431	860372	You should scan that in and post it on his Facebook.
861252	863013	I don't like I talk to the guy.
863334	864714	Fuck him.
864915	866315	Anyway.
866375	866736	It's cool.
867556	867936	I dig it.
870178	870358	Whatever.
871443	879889	I have to give a public thank you, by the way, to the lovely Marissa for the gift she sent me of amber oil perfume from Solstice Scents.
880689	881270	Very nice of her.
883051	883811	It smells pretty.
884211	885052	It smells like amber.
887742	888523	My gaming week.
888663	889443	I gotta be honest.
889503	891644	I've been moving, so I haven't had a lot in my gaming week.
891664	895846	And I hate coming on here on the show and saying, yeah, I have a video game podcast, so I haven't really been playing any video games.
896227	897887	But I think I have a pretty legitimate excuse.
898868	904311	I watched Alan play the Mortal Kombat demo, and nothing new there.
904411	908493	Although I keep laughing at the horrible, horrible Mileena fatality, because it's funny.
909013	910294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
931886	933308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
953187	953708	Thanks for watching!
974511	976812	Alright, go into our chat room with some comments on our gaming weeks.
976852	982174	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Bobby Blackwolf wants to know, how many autographs has OLR signed for others?
983294	984255	That's a good question.
984675	985135	One or two?
985335	991077	We had, was it the In The Groove disc that we gave away that, remember, we
992154	1011299	yeah and the um fucked up the cover of it the TurboGrafx I think there was something we signed right and then yeah we sent the TurboGrafx to the winner and we all signed it in silver paint pen and there was um I think we sent like a thank you note or something to somebody who did something for us and we included the ferret I remember that
1013383	1015003	I got pulled aside at Fonami.
1015643	1016664	Remember the last time I went?
1017484	1019645	To sign somebody's costume prop.
1020766	1021326	Like, okay.
1021846	1023607	I might have signed one thing at PAX East.
1023627	1026768	Did you give away the orange bat or something like that?
1026788	1026828	No.
1027048	1030410	We did a new orange bat and gave that away.
1030570	1030770	Yes.
1031350	1033811	Because the original orange bat's in the closet behind you.
1034411	1034971	It's in the closet.
1035031	1038413	Yeah, I don't have delusions that we're actually famous or whatever.
1038533	1038853	I do.
1038893	1040614	I'm delusional enough for all of us.
1040654	1041234	I'm kidding.
1041674	1045317	A random listener I just ran into in an event.
1045778	1048160	I have an autographed screener from Rob Schneider.
1048940	1050041	Which is kind of odd.
1051042	1052283	He is also very short.
1052643	1054325	A lot of actors, very short.
1054925	1056327	One of those people, not short.
1057608	1060090	God, I can't remember any actors' names today.
1060170	1062732	What the hell is wrong with me?
1063112	1067256	Jurassic Park, he's now in Law & Order, Criminal Intent.
1068076	1068196	Um...
1070629	1076717	EarthgirlsAreEasy Independence Day
1078274	1078534	Blink.
1079794	1079974	Blink.
1104116	1104977	I could have had him sign it.
1104997	1105877	I was like, ugh!
1106097	1107018	That would have been hilarious.
1108959	1110000	He probably would have laughed.
1111701	1113722	He probably would have thought that was really funny.
1115043	1116504	I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.
1116644	1121887	We've had the son of the guy from on Three's Company.
1122688	1123788	John Ritter's son?
1123928	1125229	Yeah, Jason Ritter.
1125289	1125870	He came out.
1126490	1127170	He was pretty cool.
1130034	1131455	Just a lot of people.
1131495	1132576	The guy from Fargo.
1134157	1140382	Now, when I worked at GNC, I met a lot of famous people, like the remaining members of Sublime and a bunch of wrestlers.
1140562	1142224	Well, we're going to get into video game chat, right?
1143745	1144325	Hollywood chat.
1144345	1147548	Gene Siskel out before he had his whole cancer thing.
1149469	1151930	Just a couple quick comments from chat, because again, they're behind a little bit.
1152170	1158851	TigerClaw says, Loki, you better cherish that 360 for as long as you can, because soon you will see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in the Hulk in the Avengers movie.
1159111	1160092	That's right, I forgot about that.
1160612	1162232	Oh, awesome.
1162912	1164233	He's going to be big time soon.
1164993	1165793	He is pretty big.
1165913	1171854	I mean, he directed this movie, the movie that he came in to promote.
1172134	1172434	Oh, really?
1172655	1174015	And it was him and the...
1175515	1201985	The Christopher Thornton, because they were kind of roommates and stuff, and Christopher Thornton, he got in an accident, like a climbing accident, where he became paralyzed, and this was kind of all about him and learning to deal with that, and the movie's about him realizing he has the gift of healing, kind of like one of those spiritual healers or something like that, and what he ends up doing with it, and it's kind of interesting.
1203265	1213191	More comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Who was saying about the DSI was Defective Candy said, My greatest autograph is my DSI signed by Nobuo Uematsu.
1213512	1214432	That's a pretty good one, too.
1214832	1217634	I know who else I have that actually made me super giddy to get.
1218114	1218695	Koji Kondo.
1220313	1222235	when he was doing the Wii Orchestra thing.
1222495	1226200	An SSJ100 Matt says, I signed a shoe for Electric Sisterhood at PAX East.
1226240	1227201	See, I don't even remember that.
1227261	1227722	I was drunk.
1228382	1231186	That's what I always say when I don't remember something that probably happened.
1231246	1231666	I was drunk.
1232527	1234670	Hey, I remember where one of the other ferrets went.
1235531	1236793	I actually found one when I was moving.
1237373	1237754	You did?
1237794	1238575	You didn't bring it?
1238915	1239055	No.
1239896	1241176	I'll bring it.
1241276	1243817	Remember when the other ferrets got attached to the Katamari ball?
1244377	1244838	That's right.
1245278	1246038	At E3 one year.
1246598	1246858	All right.
1247058	1247778	Enough reminiscing.
1247818	1248759	Enough Hollywood chat.
1248799	1250719	Let's get into a little bit of housekeeping.
1251079	1251880	No show next week.
1251940	1253260	We will not be here live next week.
1253400	1254320	I gotta watch the kitty.
1254580	1256621	Loki and myself have some other things we have to take care of.
1256961	1259222	DarkSakura would be a one-woman show otherwise.
1259682	1261502	And I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to that.
1261522	1263263	Oh, I could totally go live.
1263863	1266304	It's going to be called Bitches Listen.
1267464	1268585	That's what my new show is going to be called.
1268605	1269745	Wouldn't it be Listen to Bitches?
1272086	1274646	Rob, you see what our listeners can't see?
1275167	1275467	All right.
1275727	1276067	Heart.
1276727	1277407	Only half of one.
1277907	1280968	So, yeah, we won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.
1281188	1282009	So bear with us.
1283089	1284029	Yep, that's really it.
1284109	1290831	Otherwise, visit our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our Facebook at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
1290871	1292652	We're on all those sites, all the social networking stuff.
1293032	1294832	All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1295112	1299893	I don't know, it felt like after last week, this is kind of a slow news week, but there's been some things worth mentioning.
1301053	1301634	A few things.
1302774	1309815	So, of course, it's coming out now, reports of just how well the 3DS sold in different regions.
1310155	1319697	It says, you know, Nintendo said 1.5 million of the 4 million shipped handhelds were headed for Japan by the end of March.
1320237	1329488	And I guess according to the Japanese sales tracker, kind of like the MPD group over here, Mediacrate, there's still plenty of leftovers.
1329508	1332231	They're saying that they've only sold about 836,000 units, meaning that there's still...
1336215	1343738	I still haven't broken the 1 million mark in Japan and still have about 664,000 units left.
1344158	1353961	Yeah, I know from purchasing my Japanese system originally, yeah, it was pretty easy to get.
1354001	1355861	There were not shortages on this stuff.
1357022	1357262	Now...
1358883	1359243	I don't know.
1359323	1366109	For me, I think under a million units at launch is kind of... For Nintendo, isn't good.
1367270	1374317	You would kind of expect them to sell well with their handhelds because they have a pretty good market share over there and people are kind of gung-ho about that stuff.
1374717	1376739	But I really think what hurt them was the lack of...
1378120	1380241	You must have titles at launch.
1380982	1389408	Well, could it also be, I don't know, the earthquake and the tsunamis making people think of other things over there than just 3D stuff?
1389946	1393107	Yeah, okay, but the earthquake stuff happened, what, a couple weeks ago?
1393127	1394147	Is that right?
1394447	1412912	Yeah, I mean, okay, I get it, but, you know, there might have been some people that were waiting a little bit, I don't know Uh, no You can't deny that cut into sales, potential sales I mean, okay, yeah, I mean, the launch day should have probably been bigger But, you know, the month totals are smaller because of the tragedy
1413132	1414292	Okay, well, that's fine.
1414332	1415053	I'll give you that.
1415093	1420855	But I guarantee, you know, it's not going to catch up as quickly.
1420935	1424596	I think what the thing is, is it's not enough.
1425936	1433439	I mean, the 3D, from what I've found, just plain stuff, the 3D's cool, but there's no real must-have titles yet.
1433919	1437180	I mean, like the stuff I bought, like Pilotwings and Ridge Racer, it's kind of like...
1437700	1440704	Out of the stuff that's coming out, this is what I think are the best ones.
1441505	1446171	It's not like, oh my god, I've got to have Ridge Racer again, or oh my god, I've got to have Pilotwings.
1446251	1451397	It was just kind of, eh, okay, this is what I've got to choose from, so I'm going to pick this.
1451958	1454781	I don't think anyone's really super excited about a new Nintendogs.
1456483	1456864	That's true.
1457064	1457845	Steel Diver.
1457945	1463733	It definitely hurt them to not have a Mario game or a Zelda game or, hell, the Kid Icarus game at launch.
1463813	1465856	Or a new IP, for God's sake.
1465936	1468620	I mean, how about let's create something new?
1468660	1469962	Well, Steel Diver.
1470562	1470983	Okay.
1471384	1472285	Which I hear is...
1473346	1478448	Kind of not all that, but somebody at Nintendo feels like it's a thing.
1479068	1480128	So, you know, there's that.
1480188	1480668	That's new.
1481629	1481909	Yeah.
1483209	1485830	But it's not something that they're really promoting.
1485930	1488831	It's not like, you know, a Kirby or Mario or something like that.
1489371	1490691	It's just a game that they put out.
1490791	1493092	The Wii had the Zelda game, which was like a must-have.
1493132	1494252	I mean, it was just a great game.
1494632	1499694	The Nintendo 64 had Mario 64, which many will argue is one of the greatest games of all time, period.
1500394	1500614	Right?
1500914	1502515	Mario 64 was a launch game, I think?
1502595	1502775	Yeah.
1503514	1505796	GameCube, I don't recall having anything big.
1505836	1507817	I think it had, what, Luigi's Mansion.
1507837	1510139	Yeah, Luigi's Mansion was the big one.
1510339	1511921	Well, the first one, I guess.
1512761	1515823	But the GameCube also was challenged with sales in some regards.
1516064	1524890	And then I remember Mario 64 for the DS, and Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, and Mario Bros.
1524930	1525471	for the Nintendo.
1525871	1526571	So it's just...
1527612	1527992	I don't know.
1529013	1540859	And then also, once again, people are kind of looking at the 3D as kind of gimmicky and also knowing their track record with just not even really peripherals with their hardware.
1540879	1542420	It's like, well, you know what?
1543220	1548006	I'm not going to buy one right away because I know in a few months they're going to announce that they're going to have a slimmer one.
1548026	1550068	They're going to mark this down or something like that.
1550128	1553012	Or they're going to add something or tweak something.
1553112	1554714	And I don't really want to wait.
1555635	1556796	Or I'm going to wait for a new...
1559002	1560183	New stuff to come out.
1560603	1563086	Or, you know, for the actual good games to come out.
1563186	1581482	Just real quick, the GameCube launched with 12 games, and some of the highlights of those 12 games of what came out, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2, Rogue Leader, I remember that being a really cool game, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race Blue Storm was probably...
1582202	1587185	See, there's nothing in there save maybe the Star Wars game and maybe Luigi's Mansion or Wave Race.
1587205	1589166	There's nothing that really jumps at you, right?
1589506	1593828	But the GameCube, of course, was also pegged for not selling nearly as well as the 64 had.
1594369	1595809	So... Yeah.
1596370	1598591	Maybe launch titles are way more important.
1599673	1603297	But I don't know, like, is the launch that important?
1603337	1607101	See, I sort of see this as Nintendo trying to set the stage for the holidays.
1607622	1611045	I don't think Nintendo is really concerned with how this thing sells until the holidays.
1611886	1618574	Yeah, I think that's correct, but at the same time, though, they've got to try to get people... I mean, they don't want it to fail at any part.
1619254	1627178	They may not be as concerned with the numbers not being quite where they want them to be, but it is saying something, though, when your system's not selling out.
1627338	1631780	And it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's good that people can find it when they want it.
1632020	1634402	It's not like the Wii where it's just impossible to find.
1636503	1643306	But at the same time, you look at what their release schedule is for the 3DS, so there's not a lot coming out.
1643406	1645087	I mean, it's pretty slim pickin's
1647256	1650801	Forever right now because they haven't really announced a lot of stuff.
1651673	1655375	Okay, both GameGuru and Actdeft in our chatroom are chiming in saying Super Smash Bros.
1655415	1658097	Melee was about three months after the release.
1658217	1662580	Well, but that's three months later, still three months later.
1662840	1666282	And, you know, who's to say we're not going to get some of these big 3DS games three months later?
1666303	1673007	We're not, because they've already announced what the launch window stuff is, and that's from... Launch window, I love that.
1673127	1673687	Launch window.
1673767	1678010	I'm sorry, launch window may be the week that it comes out, or maybe the day it comes out.
1678370	1679271	Not three months.
1679511	1687320	I don't call, you know, if you want to use that, let's say, okay, well Xbox 360's had a really awesome launch window this past five years or six years.
1690008	1696230	I really think you can't really judge this thing until the holidays because I think the Kid Icarus will obviously be out by the holidays.
1696690	1701871	I think Nintendo's going to have that stealth title that comes out at E3 which I don't think is very stealth at all.
1701891	1706052	I'm pretty sure it's going to be Mario Brothers on the 3DS and I think that'll be out by the holidays.
1706092	1707172	That'll be New Super Mario Bros.
1707532	1708153	2 or something.
1708673	1709473	New Super Mario Bros.
1709773	1710553	3D or something.
1711253	1716494	That'll be their big thing that they come out and announce at the very end that's playable on the show floor because it's coming out this holiday.
1716514	1717295	They have some good stuff.
1717335	1718095	I mean they have like
1719255	1732382	and that thing's gonna sell a shit ton of 3Ds and then by that time you're gonna be having 3D Netflix you're gonna be, you know I really think it's just so early to tell I don't think this system was really designed to have a huge launch
1737584	1737884	We'll see.
1738364	1738825	We'll see.
1739125	1739585	Absolutely.
1739966	1740206	Alright.
1740947	1742108	Moving on to some more news.
1743108	1746691	This also has to do with handhelds and the tragedy and possibly the impact it had with it.
1747092	1748013	The NGP.
1748393	1751155	Now, there's been a lot of back and forth with this this week, so hear me out here.
1752156	1759983	The NGP might – they were saying earlier in the week it might not have happened this year because of the big earthquake that happened.
1760564	1775338	And there was a report where Jack Trenton, who is the Sony Computer Entertainment America president, talking to Bloomberg saying that Sony may have to launch the next generation portable in just one market by the end of the year, which originally they were going to be doing it everywhere.
1775778	1796548	and of course a lot of people said well that makes sense you know it's it's really unfortunate what happened but yeah that would probably be the case but then it came out a little later in the week wait a minute Jack Trenton actually said they may have to delay the release of the next generation portable and the bosses in Japan namely Satoshi Furuoka who is the um
1797728	1826341	a representative of Sony Computer Entertainment over in Japan said so far we see no impact from the quake on our launch plan saying that the original Bloomberg report was wrong period so it may not be delayed after all of course this is one of those things where it's like well you don't really know until E3 you know if Sony products in the past or any history it'll be out in Japan then it'll be out in the US and Europe so you're gonna see some bit of a delay but um
1828743	1834649	I think you're going to see something where it comes out in Japan September, October, and it comes out in the U.S.
1834909	1839253	and Europe just in time for Black Friday here in the U.S., like last week of November-ish.
1839533	1845819	Sounds likely, and by putting out rumors of delay, it'd probably just raise a little bit more of the want.
1845999	1846259	Yeah.
1847290	1851052	I still feel like we don't know enough about what the system is going to bring to the table.
1851212	1856674	Yes, we had the press event before, but a lot of stuff changes, too.
1856874	1861617	And a lot of times, the things that they advertise don't really make the launch, right?
1862717	1867219	Going back into our last story a little bit, eh?
1867579	1871481	But with the PSP, though, I don't think there's really anything they announced.
1873052	1873852	I didn't make the launch.
1874453	1875613	You just add stuff later on.
1876653	1881455	Whereas, Nintendo... Oh yeah, all this stuff is, you know, gonna be there.
1882275	1885216	Oh yeah, but it's gonna be... Don't worry, it's coming out in launch window.
1885496	1886156	It won't be long.
1886276	1887357	It'll just be a couple months.
1888517	1890038	Launch window, my ass.
1890358	1892178	Come on, just say, listen, okay?
1892258	1896200	We put this out, we wanted to get this out earlier, and you know, some of the stuff's not done, so...
1898420	1900621	Still a lot of DS chitter chatter in our chat room.
1901381	1904321	Actdeft saying the DS launch titles were pretty bad too.
1904842	1915464	There were some pretty bad games at launch, but it also had the Mario 64 conversion, which had a lot of people excited because they had changed a few things with it and made the extra characters or something.
1915924	1919885	So I seem to remember Mario 64 being a pretty big deal when that first came out on the DS.
1921106	1924508	SSJ100Matt says, there needs to be a buzz for when they go into the holidays.
1924588	1929212	If there is no buzz for it, then kids won't be begging their parents to buy it for them.
1929692	1933255	UnfoldedRaptor says, what about Super Mario Sunshine or Star Fox Adventures?
1933375	1935536	Again, both those games came way later, didn't they?
1935937	1937838	Especially Mario Sunshine was way later.
1937858	1939639	That was at least a year after.
1939659	1943182	And Star Fox Adventures is something people like to forget about.
1943482	1948924	GameGuru says, Besides the PlayStation 2's big title, Grand Theft Auto 3 came out a year after the PlayStation 2's launch.
1963689	1964590	Here's the thing though.
1964990	1968914	The PlayStation 2 had a way different thing going for it at the time.
1969294	1971876	And the big thing was, it was a DVD player.
1972217	1975059	And that was right at the time when DVDs were starting to crack.
1975279	1979043	And a lot of people were buying PlayStation 2s because...
1979443	1982606	Hey, it plays DVDs and it can play games.
1983046	1985868	It's the same thing that Sony was hoping would sell the PlayStation 3.
1986729	1988951	It plays Blu-rays and games.
1989391	1993875	And, you know, now it's all about this, it plays 3D Blu-rays as well.
1993935	2000540	In fact, you know, I don't know how many of you ran out and got Tron this week, but some of the box sets, they have stickers right on them.
2000920	2004864	Blu-ray also plays on PlayStation 3, and it says right there on the back...
2005464	2010868	To watch a Blu-ray 3D movie, you will need a Blu-ray 3D player or a PlayStation 3.
2012049	2016173	So, you know, they're really setting up a PlayStation 3 as like, you know, not just a game machine.
2016393	2020056	And that was the same deal with the PlayStation 2 and why it sold very well.
2020176	2026161	And it's a really good Blu-ray player because it's one that keeps itself up to date with, you know, over the networks.
2026221	2031985	And yeah, you can with normal, like, Blu-ray players as well, but it's a little more cumbersome than just an automatic update.
2032846	2032966	Um...
2034207	2037208	I don't know, it's just, it's good for that.
2037308	2041229	I mean, I use it for a Blu-ray player more than I use it for a game system.
2041389	2051113	Remember all the shit that people gave Xbox to when it came out because it did not play DVDs unless you bought a $50 remote, the DVD playback kit.
2051453	2051733	Yeah.
2051833	2052073	Yeah.
2053561	2055322	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2080311	2087979	It's basically tons and tons and tons of the Galaga Armada going against you.
2088922	2091484	You have to shoot lots and lots and lots and lots of them.
2091544	2093486	This isn't bullet hell, this is ship hell.
2094006	2097970	And it's done by the same people who did Pac-Man Championship Edition.
2098690	2100131	So, very cool.
2100372	2106697	It's got a new feature called Focus Fire that gives you control for secondary aiming.
2107638	2109860	And it looks like it's pretty awesome.
2109920	2112262	It's got lots of pretty colors and swirlies and things.
2112282	2116926	Yeah, it almost looks like it's like, I don't know, like Galaga meets...
2117546	2124070	Geometry Wars meets Rez or some type of Q Entertainment game is birdie.
2125471	2125971	Do want.
2127632	2128893	There's the focus fire option.
2129833	2130093	Interesting.
2130113	2141560	But it looks like one of the things is you sort of cut through them like you're making a path and then can sort of send out something that would destroy them en masse.
2142463	2143325	So it looks pretty cool.
2144367	2144828	Very neat.
2145008	2148394	And I can link the YouTube video in the chat room.
2149556	2149937	Very cool.
2149957	2154766	I'm glad to see the Pac-Man Championship Edition team is kind of continuing forward with reimagining some other titles.
2155233	2160395	This looks a little weird, but I would definitely check out a demo at least and see if it's something I would be into.
2160776	2164037	But I love Pac-Man Championship Edition and even the reimagined one.
2164057	2165578	They put out the second one not that long ago.
2165618	2166318	It's great too.
2166999	2170320	So that's a good team, reimagining some of the classics.
2170360	2172301	I wonder what other Namco classics they should revisit.
2172621	2174542	I think we should get Dig Dug Hardcore.
2176723	2177403	That would be crazy.
2177463	2180645	I don't even know how that would work, but in my head it's really funny.
2181542	2182002	XBOX 360 and PS3
2205542	2212147	So there's some new announcements made by EA regarding their basketball franchises.
2212567	2222674	You may remember NBA Elite 11 got cancelled last year when it was apparently revealed that it's crap.
2223295	2224296	So they didn't release it.
2224376	2227138	Well, a few leaked out, but they didn't release it.
2227859	2228319	Thanks for watching!
2249242	2252944	We're making great strides and looking forward to launching a new game next year.
2255966	2262089	That lesson about giving the team plenty of time was learned the hard way through the near release and scrapping of NBA 11.
2263950	2278237	And then, of course, to fill the void for not having a new NBA simulation game, there is the NBA Jam On Fire Edition that's coming to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.
2279157	2296944	and apparently it is a follow up of course to NBA Jam that was released last year and then it's going download only just like it was originally supposed to with the release of NBA Elite 11 it was supposed to be a pack in bonus I guess if you bought the game
2298004	2310733	The On Fire Edition will be getting new opponent AI, revamped visuals, and I guess a host of new online features as well as an online road trip campaign mode and roster updates.
2311614	2318179	And apparently the new AI is going to learn your tendencies and throw them back in your face.
2319780	2323363	And apparently the game will be $15 to $20, not $50 like it was released last
2327279	2333541	Last year, and really, if you ask me, it was way too expensive for a game that was originally going to be free.
2334101	2343103	Exactly, and I didn't even really think of this in terms of, oh, EA needs a basketball game this year since their other one's going to get delayed until next year.
2345323	2355006	I always thought this was kind of like, oh, I guess NBA Jam didn't really do well, so this is their way to try to make money from it by delivering it the way everybody said they thought it should have been in the first place.
2355726	2356747	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2377288	2377888	and DarkSakura.com.
2398593	2413279	So what that sounds like when the consumer hears, okay, it was going to be a packing game that was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later on after NBA Elite comes out and you can purchase that separately if you didn't buy NBA Elite for $15 to $20.
2415280	2421307	Oh, but now NBA Elite gets cancelled and now it's a $50 game because they're claiming that they added some other stuff in.
2421748	2425031	Well, I'm sorry, but what did they add in that raised the price up $30?
2425512	2427154	Because I can tell you this much.
2427374	2429116	I've seen the Xbox Live Arcade game...
2430357	2431838	Back out on PartnerNet.
2432439	2434120	And they didn't add much.
2434781	2436242	Definitely not $30 much.
2436522	2439645	So that's a load of bullshit right there.
2440205	2443948	And the fact that they're now re... I would call it a re-release.
2444108	2447271	Okay, so they're tweaking it a little bit and then selling it to you again.
2448412	2450374	Well, if you think about it, that is EA for you.
2450634	2452876	They tweak things a little bit and then they sell it to you again.
2453656	2455918	That's their sports games franchises.
2456579	2456679	Yeah.
2457219	2458120	I mean, I don't know.
2458260	2459481	It's whatever.
2459501	2460622	I mean, if you're going to buy it, cool.
2461202	2464104	Honestly, last NBA Jam game didn't look that great.
2464224	2471369	I mean, it looked all... I guess it was alright, but I did without it, and I can do without this next one.
2471909	2474191	But good news, I guess, for 2K.
2474411	2475112	At least they get a...
2475532	2476212	Thanks for watching!
2501664	2507667	Which is fine as long as it's actually new content and not just crap that they're just removed out of the game and then added back in later on.
2507887	2511849	Or like, God, I can't wait for that role-playing game to come out that costs $40.
2512549	2517711	But to beat the final boss, you need the final boss pack, which you can download for $20 on Xbox Live.
2518331	2520872	Or to finish the story, you need the epilogue pack.
2521433	2521933	You know what I mean?
2522593	2522753	Yeah.
2523213	2524254	I'd be a little worried about that.
2525856	2528337	All right, well, we'll see what happens when this game's released.
2528397	2531238	If it goes over as well as everybody thinks, it will.
2532038	2535799	Anyhow, moving on to news about Sonic the Hedgehog.
2536219	2539000	Apparently, there is a new Sonic the Hedgehog game on its way out.
2539040	2541260	It's coming out for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2541901	2544301	This was announced via Sonic's Facebook page.
2544561	2550263	There was a little teaser trailer released where Sonic is running through little colored sequences of loops and so forth.
2550703	2552645	Classic Sonic is back in the game.
2553565	2554106	Let's take a look.
2554246	2556367	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011.
2556828	2562031	Taking a look here at the little teaser video here in studio.
2563813	2565294	Let's see if we can get it to load.
2566354	2566695	Of course.
2566915	2572399	Every Sega game has to have a load.
2572419	2575761	Curious if DarkSakura can stop this because I know she's a big Sonic fangirl.
2575921	2576702	Oh yeah, watch this.
2578063	2579184	The graphics look pretty cool.
2579204	2579524	I like it.
2581124	2583445	It's in high def, very well rendered.
2585887	2586947	Running through ramps and ice.
2587027	2588408	I think that's just a trailer.
2589068	2590149	Oh yeah, this is just a trailer.
2590269	2600334	Yeah, of course, I'm sure it's pre-rendered, but... It's weird to me how they do this whole, like, two Sonic things.
2603696	2605177	It's new Sonic and classic Sonic.
2605397	2605657	Yeah.
2605677	2607338	It's still a little weird.
2607658	2609379	It doesn't really tell me enough about the game, so...
2610222	2611724	I'm sure we'll be seeing more about it at E3.
2611764	2613906	But you know what the first thing that went through my head was?
2615247	2617790	Whatever happened to Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2?
2618691	2620533	Remember how they had that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 1?
2620973	2628661	Somebody linked me to a story earlier because I'd said the same thing on Bobby's show and I got a link to a story where I guess they say it is still in development as late as late February.
2628681	2630062	They were saying that the game is still in development.
2630123	2631484	How do we make it not suck?
2631684	2640347	I know, I'm kind of sitting here going, well, usually when you have an episodic game, you plan on releasing one episode a month, not one episode a year, you know?
2640987	2641287	Weird.
2641567	2642567	Yeah, very odd.
2642948	2649770	So, I guess there's still a Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2 coming as well, but I'm also required to care about this.
2650410	2655031	But we'll see when there's some actual gameplay footage to come out, hopefully around E3.
2655532	2656632	We'll see about that, though.
2656932	2663998	Yeah, but here's my question with the whole Sonic the Hedgehog 4 stuff is who really cares?
2664138	2674567	Because, you know, the reviews on it weren't that great and most of the, you know, that was the industry reviewers and the user reviews have been pretty terrible.
2674647	2675948	So, who cares?
2676569	2682934	I mean, that's gotta suck when you're like, okay, I gotta put out a bunch of episodes now for a game that no one gives a shit about.
2683534	2683855	Damn.
2684655	2684936	You know...
2686836	2689937	It's also one of the scenes where I feel like they're always trying to reboot Sonic.
2690177	2691438	Like, let's just reboot Sonic.
2691478	2693158	Oh, we should try rebooting Sonic again.
2693178	2695099	It's like Sega's perennial answer.
2695159	2696520	Maybe it's time to retire Sonic.
2697680	2699781	Hate to go there, but I don't know.
2699921	2701821	Sonic games have been very, very hit me this early.
2701841	2703802	It's not that difficult to fix Sonic.
2704142	2705963	You make it like it was before.
2706463	2707523	The old Sonic.
2707723	2709604	Don't try to add werewolves into it.
2709824	2711545	Don't try to make it all weird.
2712325	2714526	Don't give him a sword.
2714806	2717867	Just make it Sonic.
2719507	2726149	Now, I know that you tried that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and it failed terribly, but you know what?
2726169	2727190	We can only help you so far.
2728430	2730731	Just make it like that, but not suck.
2732891	2733832	That's all you gotta do.
2735432	2740674	Alright, let's move on with another story here before we get into the release dates where we travel around the world and see what's coming out soon.
2740714	2741154	DarkSakura?
2742688	2747451	Well, actually, PopCap has decided to make a new label called 4th & Battery.
2748112	2754416	And you can actually check this out at 4thandbattery.com, as all one word, number 4thandbattery.com.
2755317	2766244	It is a new label to bring out experimental ideas to customers so they can be more creative, get stuff out that's a little bit, as they say, off the beaten path.
2766784	2770807	So it's pretty cool, and it looks like the first thing out is going to be called Unpleasant Horse.
2772368	2776513	and watching the trailer for this, it's very silly.
2776533	2778134	This horse is definitely not feeling pleasant.
2779035	2789286	You start off with bird and a pegasus and everything's happy and then here comes a dark horse with a little skull on its butt like this horse is just at the Chinese buffet and now it's feeling very unpleasant.
2789326	2790227	Pooping lightning.
2793086	2796728	It makes me think, though, of Bad Horse from Dr. Horrible.
2798048	2800249	But, yeah, it looks pretty interesting.
2800269	2803110	Apparently this was an idea they had before Forth and Battery came out.
2803770	2810133	But they're calling this, and I quote, it's a sandbox for PopCap's inner child.
2810593	2812734	Well, I'm playing some of the audio here in studio.
2814775	2815615	Aw, it's a little birdie.
2815635	2816416	No horse.
2818666	2820608	This definitely doesn't look like other PopCat games.
2820628	2822410	You're like, where's the jewels to switch?
2822690	2826373	Or, you know... You farted lightning.
2831158	2832199	It's like a bad horse.
2835442	2836322	Random hard rock.
2838588	2839689	I hope it's going to be fun.
2840249	2842490	I mean, PopCat puts out pretty high quality stuff.
2842510	2850515	It was something that I thought that it got rejected because of some sort of like throwing horses through meat grinders or something like that.
2850615	2852976	Just like weird stuff.
2853337	2855278	Sounds a little bit like Super Meat Boy if that's the case.
2855298	2860821	Well, I think it was only rejected because they said they classified it as like a family game, but not a family game.
2861341	2863783	Horses going through meat grinders are probably not very family friendly.
2864343	2865364	Depends what kind of family you have.
2866965	2871489	I just like in this interview on the page it says much like Honey Badger, Unpleasant Horse just don't give a shit.
2874031	2875672	I'm glad for the reference to Honey Badger.
2875952	2876973	Yes, I love Honey Badger.
2877213	2881056	And Unpleasant Horse, his name is Bubbles and is female.
2885359	2886540	I'm looking through the interview.
2887120	2887761	Her name is Bubbles.
2890317	2891758	Sorry, I just have to look at this a little bit here.
2891958	2892999	This is the honey badger.
2893579	2895040	Watch it run in slow motion.
2896441	2897562	It's pretty badass.
2897682	2899403	Look, it runs all over the place.
2899783	2901384	Whoa, watch out, says that bird.
2901604	2902405	Ew, it's got a snake.
2902545	2903806	Oh, it's chasing a jackal.
2904046	2904867	Oh my gosh.
2905767	2908089	Oh, the honey badgers are just crazy.
2909312	2920582	The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom It really doesn't give a shit I love that they brought Charles Nelson Reilly back from the grave to narrate that video
2923897	2927378	Anyhow, the over 30 listeners will understand that joke.
2927418	2928179	All right, let's move on.
2928199	2933461	Let's travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you.
2933521	2936202	Charles Nelson Reilly, rise from your grave.
2938302	2939823	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
2940363	2940903	Thanks for watching!
2959708	2960489	Spongebob Squiggle Pants

2979445	2983788	A re-release of Attack of the Movies 3D bundled with four blaster controllers.

2989553	2990334	That's on Wii.

3000981	3001921	That's coming out this week.
3002341	3005443	As well as, I believe, let's see here.
3005843	3007084	Oh, Fantastic Pets.
3007184	3008364	This is a game from...
3009645	3017570	THQ, it's supposed to kind of cash in on that wonderful franchise created by Connectimals.
3017990	3031058	Except, you know, instead of raising tigers and whatnot, you get to raise unicorns and lizards that turn into dragons and cats that turn into purple cats.
3032339	3033319	That's on the 360 for Kinect.
3035782	3047699	Dance Dance Revolution might have forgotten about that game for the other systems now it's finally coming out on 360 the bundle for 40 bucks that's a great price for the bundle and

3106599	3108740	Actually, I am looking forward to picking it up on 360.
3108981	3110542	So I will check that out.
3110862	3114103	What is it about the Michael Jackson experience that you're looking forward to?
3114503	3115584	Oh, I just like the dancing games.
3117105	3119365	Did you ever buy that one dancing game that came out?
3119525	3120646	It's not Dance Masters.
3120706	3121526	It's not Dance Santos.
3121546	3121986	It's another one.
3122006	3122847	Dance Paradise?
3122867	3123587	Is that what it's called?
3123707	3123947	No.
3124507	3124788	Really?
3125068	3125508	I was looking at it.
3125528	3126228	No, that looked terrible.
3126468	3127949	I looked at it and then I put it back on the shelf.
3127969	3128989	Yeah, it looks terrible.
3129670	3130630	But it has Lady Gaga.
3132185	3160909	that doesn't make me buy things though Rob makes me buy things it's just like terrible and then let's see what else we've got here um not much else really this week I was looking I actually saw some of these things that made me kind of scratch my head they have like this Rock CO game capture device it didn't really say what resolution capture it is so I could not buy that um
3162970	3164852	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
3165633	3166495	Pretty much it for this week.
3166575	3168878	Good stuff, though, in two weeks, though.
3169518	3170600	Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.
3171180	3172542	I know, it's a big week.
3172742	3173363	Squee.
3173383	3174304	Damn, there went all my money.
3174525	3175286	Lots of squee.
3176087	3177889	It's going to be a shopping spree at Fry's.
3177969	3179050	It's looking far if you're into that.
3180051	3181453	and a shopping squee.
3182534	3183775	Alright, moving on to Japan.
3183935	3186537	Let's see what you can squee about for the release dates over there.
3187318	3193904	Cross Channel, in memory of all people coming out on the Xbox 360 as well as Homefront, both getting their Japanese releases this week.
3194424	3197307	Lost Planet 2 moves into the Platinum Collection this week over there as well.
3197607	3201030	Trying to look up this Cross Channel in memory of all people and see what this is about.
3201050	3202772	I wanted to see if this is a game that's out over here.
3203192	3209577	It's from Cyberfront, and I'm not seeing a whole lot with it except a scene where the characters are in swimsuits.
3209637	3211878	So this is definitely some type of anime.
3212299	3216121	It's one of those anime games that's just not going to come over here because we don't get games like that here.
3216982	3219164	Interactive stories is what they look like to me.
3221004	3226366	Why don't we have, and this is a total random topic here, why don't we have a telenovela game?
3227006	3228847	Because that would be just so random.
3228867	3229687	A Telemundo game?
3229727	3230968	Yes, a Telemundo game.
3231268	3233168	Sabado Gigante the game?
3233188	3235469	A bunch of little mini-games on the Wii?
3236469	3237169	It would be different.
3237490	3239030	There's been nothing.
3239670	3241131	It would be awesome.
3241171	3248353	I would like to see them go back and take the old Santos franchises, the Mexican wrestler superhero franchise,
3248453	3249213	That'd be awesome.
3249353	3251194	Well, they did have the Mexican wrestling game.
3251454	3252514	Yeah, and it sucked.
3252594	3256516	But, you know, I'm talking about, like, you know, something ridiculous.
3256716	3258516	You know, like, Italian Spider-Man.
3258856	3266119	You know, even though that's not real, it would still be awesome to take that fake character and make, you know, an Italian Spider-Man game.
3266999	3272981	I'm trying to see what type of shows are on Telemundo these days that they could make a show out of.
3273281	3275702	Of course, this thing's trying to... Let's see, what are the...
3276977	3277557	I don't know what the big
3299445	3300146	I'll see you next time.

3345139	3346799	Pilotwings Resort comes out this week in Japan.
3347259	3352860	Also, Pro Yaku Spirits 2011, so the baseball sim comes out on the 3DS this week as well.

3388368	3389028	Sounds fun!

3410583	3411424	So, just saying.
3412742	3414302	Those poor guys always have to wait.
3414482	3415723	Portal 2 is out on my birthday.
3415763	3416163	Hint, hint.
3416483	3416883	Everybody.
3417983	3418763	I have a Steam account.
3421324	3421704	Alright.
3423005	3426705	I want to get the PlayStation 3 one so I get the PS3 game and the Steam game, right?
3426725	3427506	I have a PS3.
3427526	3429946	That's what I plan to do.
3431227	3433167	Alright, moving on.
3433687	3437168	So this week, a hacking group named Anonymous.
3439189	3440909	I had a feeling it was Anonymous.
3440929	3440989	Yes.
3442386	3443967	Yeah.
3445048	3445569	Anonymous.
3446129	3462243	They are now apparently, I guess, battling Sony now because they're saying, we are currently investigating, or Sony is saying, we're currently investigating including the possibility of targeted behavior from an outside party.
3463965	3465086	Yes, they were getting hacked.
3465106	3466327	They already said...
3466787	3477937	Apparently, the group, so they declare loyalty to Geohot and Raph Chocolo, you know, two hackers.
3477977	3481520	Well, Geohot, obviously, the one who created kind of the...
3482441	3490972	or has the keys that people want, release some of them so that people can actually start doing homebrew stuff.
3491292	3498020	And Graf Chocolo was behind bringing Linux back to the PS3 and he's a big part of that.
3498040	3501685	In fact, he's still actually doing hacking stuff based on that.
3502386	3514768	um well basically uh you know they're saying that they're attacking um Sony's private property because we disagree with their actions and um
3517591	3519031	Yeah, and they're going to keep on doing that.
3519091	3525973	So they were attacking the PlayStation Network and Sony's websites and stuff like that.
3526894	3534716	Of course, I guess they realized that attacking the PlayStation Network kind of hurts the people that they're trying to fight for.
3535416	3546160	So they're saying, okay, we decided that we're not going to attack the PlayStation Network at this time, but they're going to find different ways to, you know, attack Sony, I guess.
3546460	3555163	One of them being that they're going to, I guess, reveal a bunch of information about Sony's upper management, including, you know...
3556425	3566905	Crazy stuff like all their personal information, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, pictures of their family, where they live, all sorts of crazy stuff.
3568163	3571207	See, some of that stuff gets a little cray-cray.
3571427	3576754	The DOS attack is one thing, but the whole pictures of family.
3576914	3579998	When you start involving kids, I don't think anybody's comfortable with that.
3580018	3583383	But then you've got to wonder, maybe that's just a smear campaign?
3583543	3583883	I don't know.
3583923	3586507	The whole point is just to make them feel uncomfortable, I think.
3588068	3594551	Anonymous, I'm going to plead a little bit of ignorance here because I don't really fully understand what's going on there.
3594691	3596192	I know it's a big group.
3596212	3597293	I know there's a lot of people.
3597733	3601735	I know about the in-person stuff they do with Scientology and I know it's kind of a spin-off of 4chan.
3602075	3603396	I love the logo.
3603436	3605757	The logo is fucking awesome.
3606237	3608659	So nobody's really in charge there?
3608979	3610440	No, no one's really in charge.
3610840	3612081	They actually grew on 4chan.
3613001	3614563	So it's like a Borg thing.
3615104	3616846	It's a group collective, right?
3617427	3618829	Is that how it works?
3618949	3620110	I'm sure there's people behind it.
3620451	3621612	It all runs on groupthink?
3622952	3641496	Because it's, I, I, yeah, like, I don't, like, surely somebody in Anonymous says, dude, pictures of families, not okay, you know, like, it's one thing to, like, order illegitimate pizzas and send them to Sony headquarters, but when you start posting pictures of people's kids, like, that's, that's too much, you know?
3642636	3644417	And then, and then, you know...
3646472	3670019	uh sony sony sony but you know if and this is the thing too especially with any kind of radical type group it's that if they don't follow through on the threat no one's gonna take them seriously the thing oh they won't do that but the thing is i'm pretty damn sure they will and it's that sort of uh i hate to put it this way but sort of like uh
3672395	3674118	Integrity, if you know what I mean.
3674559	3677344	The fact that if they say they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.
3678366	3681031	That gets people, you know...
3683060	3683661	Listening to them.
3683901	3691708	Well, the other thing they were too pissed off about was the fact that Sony was collecting the IP addresses for everybody that visited Geohot's site.
3691808	3693009	Well, that was ridiculous.
3693209	3701756	And they're saying, no, if you do anything with that, you go after anybody, you're going to have hell to pay.
3702937	3704218	So, the other thing...
3706789	3708751	I don't understand these companies.
3709851	3716835	Basically, Sony hired this outside company to help protect them during this DDoS attack.
3716936	3720438	They have the hosting provider for Sony.
3721198	3728322	They're belittling Anonymous' cyber attack, calling it medium strength and something that's only annoyed our network engineers.
3729703	3732645	Why would you say something like that?
3732705	3735527	That's just going to piss them off and make them try harder.
3736348	3737409	Do people not learn?
3737909	3739430	Oh, our system's unhackable.
3740411	3742412	It's the most secure system ever.
3743173	3745174	Oh, your attack was pathetic.
3745755	3750498	I've seen worse from my grand... I mean, seriously, why would you do that?
3750578	3752740	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they acknowledged it at all.
3752760	3755862	It's like, oh great, thank you dumbass that had to open your mouth.
3756162	3756903	Now you're going to...
3758789	3759830	It's just going to piss them off.
3760250	3761230	That's all you're doing.
3761550	3763311	You're just going to piss them off now.
3764672	3764932	Great.
3765512	3766853	Can't wait to see what happens this week.
3768473	3769154	Piss who off?
3770954	3773015	See, that's just the part.
3773456	3777397	I don't know.
3779318	3785941	There's definitely got to be a lot of varying opinions within that group, such as how far do you go.
3787222	3788182	So, you know.
3790541	3792262	I don't know, we'll see what happens
3809289	3810530	and so on and so forth.
3833422	3837145	sent the email for the password reset to get to the Xbox Live account.
3837545	3839826	So, you know, your Xbox Live account is fine for now.
3840327	3842488	But this guy did this to kind of get his point across.
3845150	3850053	Obviously, the guy is the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live, so it's not like he couldn't get his own account back.
3850734	3862542	The hacker is named Predator, and he basically made a whole little boasting thing on YouTube and, I don't know, was kind of like talking a lot about how he's doing them a favor and so forth.
3862642	3863743	I don't know, kind of weird.
3864544	3867707	I think he's trying to be one of those hackers that really wants to get hired by the company.
3868327	3870509	But I don't know if that's really the best way you go about doing it.
3870549	3874253	But you know how companies will hire hackers to help improve the integrity of the system?
3875174	3877796	I think maybe that's what this guy is trying to do, but he's going about it the wrong way.
3877816	3883421	Especially if you get banned from Xbox Live 35 times, you're probably just a dick, dude.
3883441	3885303	It means they probably don't want to deal with you at all.
3885583	3889047	Yeah, so this probably wasn't the best way to get your point across.
3889107	3892210	Maybe a nice little heartfelt, I'm sorry, be better.
3892590	3892891	I don't know.
3893427	3896128	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3922859	3923821	It's actually two games.
3924021	3925043	It's Killer Instinct.
3925284	3925905	Both 1 and 2.
3925965	3927528	Because I had to put them together.
3928291	3928631	Alright.
3929872	3931093	But the first one's really the best.
3932033	3933654	Let's check out some of this music.
3934294	3936375	The ambience from Killer Instinct 1.
3936415	3939957	This used to be my favorite music in the game.
3941458	3948642	Anyway, Killer Instinct was developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo and was in the arcades in 1994.
3949642	3954284	And it was rumored to use the Ultra 64 hardware engine.
3954925	3956105	In fact, there was actually this...
3957466	3959147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3983886	3987209	When you finished one up, the fight would pause and your new bar would fill up.
3987389	3988410	So that's how it worked.
3988710	3993573	You had combos that if you pressed the buttons in a certain order, they would just auto-combo.
3994254	3997176	And then you had your finishers that are called No Mercy.
3999498	4002040	Although other versions called it a danger move.
4002941	4008965	And it was basically violent finishers like an orchid would flash your boobs and the other person would die of a heart attack.
4009145	4010066	Unless it was another orchid.
4010266	4011807	Then she'd just stomp her feet and be jealous.
4012848	4013869	That was cute.
4013949	4016950	And then you also had humiliations where it would make people dance.
4017671	4018911	And they had different dance style.
4019011	4025315	You had the ultra combo that was basically they just go into this huge ass auto combo.
4025915	4030438	But with some of the characters you could actually keep rejuggling with extra hits at the end of the combo.
4030858	4032299	So you could get over 80 hits.
4033459	4036161	I was always really good at the 44 hit combo with Orchid.
4037009	4048179	Anyway, you also had combo breakers where if you either hit in the double digits or were in the combo link stage, you could do this little move and it would break the combo.
4049019	4049860	Combo breaker!
4049940	4052482	Anyway, so it was pretty neat.
4052762	4061330	You also could do these advanced moves right after you did a combo breaker, like Jago, for example, would have a red fireball instead of the green one.
4062250	4068992	So your characters in the first one were Fulgor, Cinder, Glacius, Jago, Ripter, Sabrewolf, Spinal, who was actually the second to last.
4069373	4070573	No, the third to last.
4070593	4071293	The second to last.
4071553	4073914	Because I think Fulgor was after him and then it was Idle.
4073954	4086238	Anyway, TJ Combo, Chief Thunder, Orchid, well it says B-Orchid, I guess it's supposed to be Black Orchid, and Idle, who didn't have any special moves at all, except he could refill his life by stomping on the ground.
4086878	4090700	It was also the first arcade game that had an internal hard drive.
4091760	4110280	and the game was actually done in pre-rendered sprites that was done by Silicon Graphics and the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a movie but the frames would adjust based on where the characters were so it was pretty cool it also used the R4600 processor it's pretty cool
4112192	4112692	Oh, you filmed.
4113193	4116254	I'm just jumping to random ones, playing little bits before you get to the second game.
4116274	4128698	There was a SNES version that had a lot of stuff cut out and way panned out, but it came with Killer Cuts, which was a 16-track remix version of all the songs.
4128718	4134620	You could actually order it through Nintendo Power, or you could get the CD if you bought the game.
4134700	4135921	I got mine because I bought the game.
4137381	4138422	and it was in a black case.
4138462	4148685	There was a Game Boy version but if you played on the Super Game Boy it had actually limited color added to it and you could play two player and they actually really toned down a lot of the characters moves.
4149485	4156487	For the Nintendo 64 there was not a Killer Instinct or Killer Instinct 2 but you had Killer Instinct Gold that was based off of Killer Instinct 2.
4157348	4160229	And that leads us to Killer Instinct 2!
4160849	4161949	Yay!
4163270	4164310	How about some new music Rob?
4165140	4165860	Working on it.
4166220	4166601	Okay.
4168041	4172563	Killer Instinct 2 is the sequel and they changed moves.
4173903	4174363	Annoying.
4174383	4175904	Which one is this?
4176164	4177865	Working.
4177905	4184847	Yeah, that was the CD version.
4185167	4185868	But it was really cool.
4185888	4186968	This is my favorite music in the game.
4194082	4205195	Now, I'll tell you, when Dan got Killer Instinct Gold, I had him, because you had to keep starting the game over to get the right music, and he actually recorded an mp3 of this for me because I wanted it that badly.
4206216	4207057	I was a big nerd.
4207337	4210501	This is when we were first friends on the interwebs.
4211782	4212283	But KI2...
4214645	4216506	Thank you for watching!
4233031	4240715	Some of the normal moves though were toned down and then you also had different blocking moves that were thrown in.
4240735	4246898	You also had throws too and then there were ways to glitch a combo and do different moves along with that.
4248258	4255205	It basically had sort of a rock, paper, scissors system with how certain moves could be tied to certain moves.
4255385	4257327	And it was really bizarre.
4257647	4259729	Killer Seek 2, for me, was a lot harder of a game.
4260950	4264934	And then you had a super bar where you could fill it up when you take damage.
4265354	4270499	And then you could do a huge super move, which was an extended version of the regular move.
4271520	4271680	And...
4273883	4281331	It had actually a parry system, so you could counter attack after a block, and all kinds of different stuff.
4281431	4289080	It was new finishing moves, all kinds of new stuff, and no humiliations though, but every character had two ultimate combos.
4290582	4310356	and you can still do ultra combos so with the characters in this one the ones that came back were Fulgor, Jago, Spinal, TJ Combo, Glacius, Sabrewolf and Orchid and all of her moves changed it was so weird and then the new characters were Maya who was the one that I used the most and according to Nintendo Power she was the worst dress of 1996 she had nice boobies
4313198	4315340	and Tusk, who was like her dude.
4316080	4317861	Kimwoo, who was actually pretty fun.
4318001	4323405	And Gargos, who was a demon lord, who was the rival of Eidol.
4323986	4325206	And you could only use them with a cheat code.
4326647	4331250	So they had different endings based on how you beat the game.
4331951	4335894	So like Jago's was different based on...
4337859	4342200	If he kills Orchid, or if he kills Fulgor, it's weird stuff.
4342300	4343561	But they had all kinds of different stuff.
4344381	4350703	With Kill Instinct Gold, which is the Nintendo 64 version that I said before, it was a near-launch title.
4351603	4355305	And it did downgrade a few things, but it was pretty darn faithful.
4355665	4365408	You had team battles where you could fight with up to 11 characters, you had elimination battles, training and advanced training, and a full option menu where you could modify stuff.
4365928	4376856	Like how fast the game went, the color of the blood button configuration and your controller pack data and unlockable content like different colors and different scenarios and faster speeds of the game.
4376876	4377917	You can make it like super fast.
4379278	4386704	And most of the full motion video scenes were pretty much removed because, hi, it was a Nintendo 64, it was cartridge.
4387644	4393089	And so they did simple animations instead.
4393770	4399615	And the game was fully rendered in 3D instead of the whole scaling full motion video.
4400695	4405680	So it was pretty close to being good.
4406841	4410445	And there actually was some censorship about that around Orchid.
4411126	4421096	In the full version, there was a scene with Orchid in the introduction, and they actually...
4423207	4430209	played it on a UK show called Game Master but it was cut when the arcade release came out so maybe someone can find it on YouTube.
4430329	4430629	Who knows?
4431430	4441652	But it won four Nintendo Power Awards and has a really good soundtrack called the Killer Instinct Gold Cuts soundtrack.
4443013	4443393	And that's it.
4446138	4449820	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Killer Instincts 1 and 2.
4450280	4452021	I guess 2 will have to share the stage this week.
4452041	4452761	Let's just say Gold.
4453201	4454262	Fine, Killer Instinct Gold.
4454562	4456403	But with major nods to the arcade versions.
4456743	4457183	You got it.
4457963	4460885	All right, that's going to do it for Part A of our show.
4460925	4461725	But don't go anywhere.
4461745	4463626	We've got plenty more to cover when we come back.
4463966	4468828	When we come back, we're going to get into some things such as rapid-fire news, including news on Ninja Gaiden 3.
4469729	4472710	Not the old one on the NES, but for new consoles.
4473350	4482458	Talk a little bit more about Michael Jackson The Experience, some new tracks coming out for Rock Band, some changes going on at GameStop, and Atari reboots on iOS devices.
4482598	4486881	We're going to talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4487502	4496569	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, April the 10th of 2011 as we do tape live on Sunday nights at AllGamesRadio.com.
4499031	4503114	Now, we can't play the music on the podcast feed, but I have to mention this.
4503454	4506076	That last song cut off rather awkwardly, didn't it?
4506577	4507137	It was kind of sudden.
4507157	4507778	That it did.
4507978	4508478	And we're live.
4508758	4509619	I can play clips.
4509659	4511000	You can get away with playing clips on podcasts.
4511020	4514363	We were playing a track called Work It Out from, what is this, Sonic R, right?
4515083	4520127	So let me just play, let me play the last like 10 seconds of the mp3 here, and you get to see how awkwardly this cut off.
4522620	4524281	I'm jamming, I'm jamming, and it's done.
4524301	4524522	Yeah.
4551883	4554085	DarkSakura has another podcast.
4554145	4554925	If you like OLR, you might like...
4572515	4578088	It is called Comic Insanity and it is me, Maren Marvel and Dan Shadow and we talk about comics.
4578970	4581897	And we did not have a show this week, but next week.
4582178	4582439	Frown.
4583325	4583926	We will have a show.
4584666	4584946	Smile.
4585687	4585927	Grin.
4586407	4586868	Happy face.
4587288	4592873	You can check us at infamous.net N-F-A-M-O-U-S Any more big celebrities planned for your show?
4592913	4594334	You had some guy that was on Heroes.
4594834	4595635	He was really cool.
4595835	4596456	Todd Stashwick.
4596896	4597316	Really nice guy.
4597336	4597556	Who is he?
4598617	4599218	Todd Stashwick.
4599258	4602200	He was in season four, so unfortunately it was after I stopped.
4602280	4602901	I had the same reaction.
4602921	4603881	I was like, ah, I stopped watching.
4604682	4607644	He's been in Buffy and Supernatural.
4607785	4608645	What was his power?
4611027	4611788	He was the multiple man.
4612588	4612709	Oh.
4613609	4614590	Multiplicity sucked.
4615331	4617153	The power to make you listen to any podcast.
4617393	4618294	But he's a really cool guy.
4618454	4619215	Really, really nice.
4624752	4642265	there's more coming it's hard being an actor in Hollywood too like if I had been offered the role of a hero that just made people defecate on command that would be awesome they call me the brown note if Rob thought of his nickname it would be Poopy Pants
4643988	4646031	There you go.
4646091	4648614	Well, excuse me, Mr. Poo-Poo Pants.
4648814	4649936	Where do I sign?
4649996	4650937	The Defecator.
4652399	4652639	Nice.
4653280	4654181	The Defecatrix.
4654461	4658787	Well, now that I've brought defecation in your show in the same sentence, I apologize for that.
4658827	4660970	But anything else you want to say about Comic Insanity?
4661210	4661771	We're awesome.
4661791	4662311	Listen to us.
4663632	4670554	My Side Project is a show with the one and only Extifer called The Best Lil Horde House in Azeroth called Horde House for short.
4670574	4672574	Visit us www.hordehouse.com.
4672594	4676535	If you like World of Warcraft or even if you don't, you just like digging fart jokes, join us every week.
4676575	4678156	We put new shows up about Friday.
4678176	4679196	We don't tape live right now.
4679496	4680036	Maybe someday.
4681177	4682897	We definitely want to get back into that at some point.
4683497	4684738	I do want to throw this out there.
4685278	4687519	Hordehouse.com is the website behind it.
4687819	4690900	And we've been having more and more people kind of write for the site.
4690940	4693781	And by more, I mean one other person, but we have another one planned too.
4694542	4699864	And one of the articles you just posted about how to closet your dragon was the article.
4699904	4707087	And it's about how Blizzard has kind of deflamboyantized one of the monsters that was in Warcraft.
4707407	4709068	It's been getting a ton of hits through Reddit.
4709208	4713872	It's like a controversial article and I'm very excited because it's only like the third blog post on our site.
4713932	4715913	So big things in the future at Horde House.
4716693	4718415	Lots of hordes to talk about.
4718955	4719195	All right.
4720696	4721036	That's it.
4721297	4724499	Let's move into some rapid fire news and then we'll get to your tweets.
4725800	4727501	Twitter.com slash OLR one more time.
4728741	4735262	The latest issue of the official PlayStation magazine had some neat little tidbits regarding the new Ninja Gaiden game.
4735982	4743484	Ninja Gaiden 3, which is going to be 3, not Sigma 3, just 3, both systems, you know, all playing around harmoniously.
4744884	4749925	There's some info, they're saying that there's going to be a complex multiplayer mode.
4750525	4754286	They're not really drawing any comparisons with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
4758008	4759729	But, you know, it sounds neat.
4760089	4762611	I mean, everybody has multiplayer nowadays, so why not?
4763471	4769476	They're saying that also Ryo's going to be the only playable character in the game this time around.
4769796	4776881	None of these all, you know, bonus characters from Dead or Alive or, you know, the DS or whatever.
4777681	4784025	Um, they're also saying that there are going to be, um, you know, many, uh, difficulty levels, I guess.
4784505	4794752	They're not necessarily making the game easier, but they're going to try to make the game more exciting and being able to be enjoyed by everybody, um, as well as hardcore gamers.
4795372	4800595	So, uh, I'm assuming you'll probably hear more at E3 about this game because it sounds like a pretty big one.
4801796	4801916	Um,
4803337	4819174	Then of course Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan They put out a lot of weird games in Japan And there's a couple highlights that were on blogs this week One comes from Famitsu It's a cell phone game Um
4820655	4824498	That's called I Love Woman's Body Climber.
4826259	4828400	Basically, the premise is you climb up girls.
4829381	4831703	And you are climbing them.
4832043	4838447	For example, it's kind of think of like Shadow of the Colossus, but with schoolgirl anime chicks.
4838647	4840068	And you're this tiny little dude.
4841629	4850335	So you have to, for example, it's harder to climb up bare skin than, say, pull yourself up like on one of their sailor suits or whatever.
4852196	4854097	Weird shit, but it's interesting.
4854117	4858921	It sells for, I guess, 315 yen, which is relatively cheap.
4859301	4861783	Does a little song play while you're climbing the woman?
4866025	4871749	It should, though.
4872490	4873651	You know what, people?
4873871	4878674	Since the big thing is to now knock off games on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace...
4880390	4880810	There you go.
4880870	4882331	That's a niche that's not being filled.
4883172	4884132	Weird shit like that.
4884372	4886374	Scale woman's bodies to yodel music.
4887594	4888555	That'd be awesome.
4889075	4892057	I'm seriously, that would be just amazing.
4892257	4898001	That was inspired by the cliffhangers game on The Price is Right, by the way, when a little dude climbs the mountain and yodels.
4898501	4898801	Forget it.
4899221	4899382	Yeah.
4899782	4901623	Lots of old school game show references on tonight's show.
4903327	4924078	Um, okay, let's see, the next game, which I'm going to try to pronounce here, but I probably will do a bad job of it, it's, uh, Gachi Tora, um, Arem, um, Abarenbo, uh, Kyoshi in High School, and basically, this is, looks like a weird...
4925939	4928161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4952652	4956534	Why do I have a feeling like, you know, a chef being in there, you know?
4957014	4959555	Chef's soul battles, or soul nude battle system.
4959995	4966277	Basically, you scream at people and they take off their clothes, or their clothes come off, so that's what that's about, and that's on the PSP.
4967078	4978782	What's also weird, though, on top of all that, I guess you also can play baseball and do some other weird minigames in there, but it just looks very oddball.
4980620	4982280	Screaming at someone makes them naked.
4982821	4983761	If only that worked.
4988942	4991163	It's almost like Pee-wee's secret word of the day.
4992763	4995124	When someone says the word of the day, scream real loud.
4996464	5000965	And then last... Last but not least... Clothes fly off like the Benny Hill Show.
5001065	5001285	Okay.
5001445	5002565	A little bit of a disappointment.
5002605	5003526	Come on, Nintendo.
5003626	5004726	Why, why, why?
5005546	5033147	DSiWare I guess the DSi shop although not available yet much like the Wii shop games from the DSi shop cannot be run off of an SD memory card and while the Wii had a patch later on that allowed you to do that the DSi does not allow you that you have to put the game on the internal memory and that's where it's going to stay
5034408	5059831	and that's it it says apparently though of course the 3DS wear in virtual console games will be able to directly play off an SD card DSI wear that you buy new or transfer over on the 3DS still requires you to store it to the internal memory of the 3DS it's kind of a step backwards I guess is that like their copy protection?
5060501	5061763	No, it doesn't make any sense.
5062565	5064768	DSiWare is the only thing that's stuck like that.
5065109	5069156	3DSWare or virtual console stuff, oh, you can put that back and forth.
5069236	5071139	But DSiWare, no.
5071700	5072120	That's weird.
5074133	5074994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5100331	5102492	And this thing is just fucking crazy.
5102652	5113494	Basically, it's an animation program developed by Bob Sebastian from Flat Black Films, the company responsible for rotoscoping in The Waking Life and The Scanner Darkly.
5114255	5118956	And apparently this game, or program, or whatever you want to do, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.
5118976	5125157	You can do rotoscoping, you can do green screen, you can do time-lapse photography using this.
5125277	5127478	You can make your own animations.
5128499	5139671	all sorts of crazy stuff for $5 $5 seriously they could have sold this shit for $30 and been able to sell a ton of it but yeah that's coming out April 25th nice
5142355	5142675	All right.
5143356	5144477	Well, let's move on.
5144498	5150364	Of course, I can't play it on April 25th because they haven't released a damn store yet for the 3DS.
5150604	5151445	Oh, sorry.
5151586	5153808	We didn't finish that part of the 3DS.
5154269	5157432	Well, something you will be able to buy whenever it does come out.
5157552	5158634	You don't know Jack.
5158814	5163099	Of course, the revival just came out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, and it's pretty damn good.
5163519	5164059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5180928	5183151	Now, it's not going to support multiplayer, however.
5183291	5188077	It will have Game Center support, and it will have 20 full episodes.
5188458	5193084	Now, I don't know if these are 20 recycled episodes in the console games or 20 all-new episodes.
5193144	5194245	I really hope it's all new.
5194686	5198811	But, yeah, the game is on its way at some point.
5199686	5204628	Battlefield 3, some people are very exciting about this, and it's going to have a lot of ads.
5205168	5208830	Hope you like your ads in your game, because Battlefield 3 is going to have a lot of them.
5209490	5216673	That's right, because, let's see, John Riccatello, who of course is the Electronic Arts CEO, he was talking to advertisers saying, quote,
5217353	5222817	Expect a couple hundred million dollars in marketing against the Call of Duty and so forth.
5223597	5225579	It's designed to take Call of Duty down.
5225899	5231943	Now, Riccatello said, kind of in a follow-up to that, that in-game advertising doesn't necessarily mean billboards.
5232703	5238087	Half of online multiplayer time is spent in lobbies, and that's where folks are expecting advertising.
5238467	5240489	So you might be seeing ads in the lobbies.
5240989	5246593	No, people are expecting advertising on TV, not on a multiplayer lobby.
5247794	5256842	that's kind of just an asshole thing to do so not only are there going to be ads on TV for the game for them to try and beat Call of Duty but there's going to be plenty of ads in the game as well that should be lots of fun
5258786	5263409	Hey, Michael Jackson, The Experience, the game that Loki's looking forward to next week on the Xbox 360.
5263509	5267351	It's already sold 3 million units globally because, you know, the game has been out on the Wii.
5267732	5270634	It's basically just dance, but it's all Michael Jackson songs.
5271314	5278158	Yeah, the Wii, the DS and PSP versions, they've sold 319,000 units in the UK.
5278699	5281160	11%, they said, of the global sales.
5281580	5283742	So that means it's sold about 3 million worldwide.
5284122	5284383	DarkSakura
5297608	5300349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5321620	5330242	And it looks like Dreams and Edge of Seventeen both have pro guitar and bass expansions available for another 99 cents.
5330502	5331522	God, I love Stevie Nicks.
5331542	5332442	She's a fierce bitch.
5332542	5332942	She is.
5333723	5338684	And then, Silent Hill Revelation, which is going to be the next movie based off of Silent Hill 3.
5339864	5344585	And Carrie Ann Moss is going to be in it as Claudia Wolfe, who may or may not be evil.
5345605	5361191	and we also have in there Malcolm McDowell who's going to be Leonard Wolfe who may or not be evil who knows we've played the game we know and then Mass Effect 3 it's not going to be multiplayer
5361584	5364606	They may do multiplayer in later games, but not Mass Effect 3.
5365226	5366447	Confirmed Mass Effect 4.
5368008	5374572	They are going to expand the RPG elements with larger skill trees and different power evolutions.
5375772	5384377	And they are not going to make the weapons as customizable as they were, but they're going to have different behavioral changes and appearance changes.
5384778	5386879	And all weapons can be used by all classes.
5388795	5389875	So, cool.
5390896	5391496	But not as cool.
5393076	5393316	Is it?
5394437	5394777	I don't know.
5395157	5397297	Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics.
5398478	5401859	Every week we invite you guys to tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.
5401899	5403019	Let's read some of the tweets tonight.
5403459	5406800	Defective Candy tweets us and says, "...forgot my MP3 player the other day.
5407180	5410721	Was so happy I remembered about OLR's pod lines.
5411321	5413582	Phone plus OLR equals awesome."
5414022	5416083	And I had to rack my brain for a minute after reading this tweet.
5416103	5418584	I was like, what the hell is Podlines?
5418984	5426308	And then I remembered, there's this service online called Podlines where apparently you can call and listen to podcasts on the phone.
5426868	5429369	You don't even need an iPhone or whatever to do it.
5429809	5434692	So I don't really officially endorse this site, but I guess it's kind of cool what they're doing.
5435192	5439334	Apparently you can call this number, and I'm going to call it and see what happens actually right now.
5439534	5439995	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5458474	5459414	Am I going to hear myself?
5459835	5460295	I guess so.
5460495	5462676	New music from independent artists.
5463116	5464676	Call Song Numbers Radio.
5464697	5466837	Well, now I don't care about these independent artists.
5468698	5470539	I don't want to hear the ad.
5470559	5471099	I want to hear me.
5474640	5475060	Wow.
5475681	5479122	It's last week's show in really crappy quality.
5483291	5486453	Tonight, April 3rd, it's last week's show.
5486794	5487934	You can listen on the phone.
5488535	5489475	Call on your cell phone.
5491117	5491597	Interesting.
5493278	5497141	I guess that's a neat idea for a service, though, and obviously they're making money off those little ads in the beginning.
5497181	5499663	A lot of people have, like, damn limited minutes plan or, you know, stuff like that.
5499683	5501344	That's true, especially nighttime minutes.
5501364	5504867	Like, if you're working a graveyard shift, too cheap for an iPhone, there's a way to do it.
5505427	5506508	All right, let's see.
5506648	5510010	Ronnie Bailey is saying, at OLR, listening to OLR.
5510571	5511992	I want an OLR autograph.
5513152	5514212	Okay, I've got a tissue.
5514232	5514853	I've got a pen.
5515093	5515433	All right.
5516013	5520615	Ronnie Bailey just needs to DM us his address and we will autograph something and send it to him.
5521315	5522396	How about an empty CD case?
5522776	5523456	We'll find something.
5523536	5524336	I might have something.
5524757	5525517	There's my coffee cup.
5526617	5527878	You would give away your coffee cup?
5528418	5529198	It's in the trash can right now.
5529218	5530239	It's a Starbucks coffee cup.
5531059	5532861	We'll find something for Ronnie Bailey.
5532881	5535563	DM us your address and we will send you something.
5535823	5536044	Yeah.
5536324	5536584	All right.
5538025	5538966	Just because you asked.
5539166	5542629	And I don't want everybody else jumping in there saying, I want free shit, I want free shit.
5542649	5544711	No, Ronnie Bailey gets it because he asked nicely first.
5545452	5546112	All right, let's see.
5546593	5547994	Tigerclaw says his tweet.
5548114	5549055	Oh, I heard about this.
5549075	5550036	This is 1 versus 100.
5550656	5551617	It's coming back, y'all.
5551797	5552838	1 versus 100 is coming back.
5552938	5553339	Yay.
5553899	5555140	Not on Xbox Live, though.
5555180	5555380	Boo.
5556402	5559265	One Versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
5559986	5560747	Double boo!
5561488	5562991	Where's my fail horn for that one?
5564533	5567056	One Versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
5567677	5571182	I guess the version on Game Show Network didn't do too hot, just so you know.
5571582	5573263	It's being developed by iWin.
5573363	5575303	It is being licensed by Animal USA.
5575843	5578624	And it will be the mob versus the one structure.
5579064	5584066	Individual players will be inviting their friends to join the mob to answer questions.
5584126	5587107	And I guess either knock off them or the user.
5587127	5588147	I don't really know how this works.
5588507	5590248	So there's also Facebook different modes there.
5591048	5593489	It will not just be the Xbox version ported.
5593529	5595149	It's being remade by iWin.
5595189	5598630	But if you want to play 1 versus 100, I guess you'll have to go to Facebook's.
5598930	5600411	You can put that in between your farm.
5601482	5602443	and your Knights of the Clicky.
5604244	5607667	Another tweet from Tigerclaw305.
5608027	5611950	Apparently, Kojima has been teasing a new Snatcher game.
5613271	5613771	Yay!
5613791	5618575	Now, didn't we have a rumor a couple weeks ago that Kojima was working on something new and didn't really say what it was yet?
5619796	5620096	I don't know.
5620376	5624399	Stop working on new stuff and finish the damn game that you have in progress.
5624499	5626641	Well, hey, this new Snatcher game could be pretty cool.
5627701	5630403	So, Snatcher was a text-based adventure game.
5630484	5630884	It, you know...
5631204	5638107	I remember something, I want to say about a year ago, maybe a few months ago, where folks were translating the second game in the series.
5639208	5651554	So yeah, Snatcher, I guess, has been dormant for a long time, but I guess he tweeted something like, quote, I've readied a complete Snatcher set for some reason.
5652514	5656176	So I don't know, maybe people are taking that tweet very far.
5656636	5660318	And I also hate that Twitter is now becoming a respectable news source, but there you go.
5662499	5664560	Alright, anyhow, so that could be coming soon.
5665100	5665801	It would be kind of neat.
5666101	5669923	I do remember the whole Kojima's working on something and maybe Snatcher would be it.
5670563	5671024	So we'll see.
5674145	5675706	Let's see.
5675846	5677807	I guess Actdeft is tweeting us this.
5678328	5681329	Game Boy music video is exactly what it sounds like.
5682150	5687053	It's an article on Joystick here that has a Game Boy bunch of Game Boys.
5687073	5687493	Let's see this.
5693076	5703345	Oh, see, the reason why you're hearing all these hammering sounds and things is somebody actually clicking their Game Boy and putting headphones into the slot, getting that humming noise and things like that.
5704386	5710872	I was thinking it was actually going to be like chiptunes, but no, this is somebody doing random things with an old-ass Game Boy.
5712533	5713154	That's pretty cool.
5713494	5715095	It takes talent to put something like that together.
5715976	5716276	Neato.
5717537	5719559	SilverSonic has linked us to this.
5720360	5722301	I believe this is also from Joystick.
5722761	5724223	Except he just linked us to the picture.
5724263	5725824	It has something to do with Child of Eden.
5728226	5729887	We didn't get actually linked to the article.
5730187	5731649	Yeah, Child of Eden seems cool.
5732429	5733970	I'm actually really looking forward to that game.
5734911	5736933	Some folks that were playing it at PAX...
5738376	5739297	We're really enjoying it too.
5739317	5747561	The article is about, remember, I don't know if they said that it's going to support up to like four controllers vibrating or something like that.
5747881	5749262	This is the corset, isn't it?
5749322	5750283	Something about a corset.
5750663	5751323	Oh, yes.
5751423	5753244	I do remember reading about that.
5753885	5754245	Awesome.
5755926	5756926	Let's get some more tweets.
5757006	5763230	Gamer Girl tweets us saying, Which do you think is better, Japanese versions of games or American versions of games?
5763809	5764670	That depends on the game.
5781161	5784244	Blue Swim What was the first music album and first game soundtrack you bought?
5810206	5812269	The first game soundtrack I bought?
5817736	5818558	That's a good question.
5820019	5824686	Ironically enough, it was probably DDR3rd Mix for me.
5825166	5825827	Because, you know...
5827382	5849578	I remember trying to get soundtracks online of like Final Fantasy 6 and like the old school Final Fantasy games like I was really into those musics but you know it was really hard to get musics on CD back then over here so I would say you probably have to go back to when we first you know we're really starting to see more game soundtracks come out on CD in the CD gaming era and probably something like DDR third mix for me
5850020	5858542	Well, I had, um, we had a bunch of, like, when I first moved in with Dan, we had the TurboGrafx games that we could just, you know, play the CD, because they were Redbook audio.
5859202	5867985	So, but, and I'll tell you what, I actually, I know what the first one that I personally bought that was not a, a, uh, bootleg.
5869325	5870566	We used to get those all the time.
5871386	5877909	And this was like me personally buying it with my own money by myself going out, not people sending me copies or anything or all that.
5879450	5882452	I went out and bought the Busted Moves soundtrack right when it came out.
5882532	5882912	Oh, nice.
5883232	5886974	It had the screensaver and everything built in with it and all the cool stuff.
5887834	5893197	And then I actually, that's the first one that I personally went out to buy.
5894197	5895998	I mean, we found other ones.
5896018	5897539	We've been given other ones, you know.
5899600	5901863	Bustin' Move 2, The Dancing Game, Two Mix's Greatest Hits
5923260	5923460	Nice.
5925041	5925702	Going to our chat room.
5925722	5928043	I'm catching up on chat comments because I've been reading Twitters.
5928683	5934527	Salacious Pop reminded me of something we saw the other day saying Zynga is now in the old Sega building in San Francisco.
5934847	5935408	True facts.
5935488	5937529	Driving back from San Francisco the other day on Friday.
5937969	5939250	Driving by the old Sega building.
5939270	5941792	You know you'd see that like coming off 280 going back onto 80.
5942452	5943573	You drive by that old Sega building.
5943593	5944734	Yeah, Zynga's in there now.
5945134	5946054	Doesn't that make you sad?
5946455	5947335	That's crazy sad.
5947575	5948276	That's very sad.
5948917	5953183	SJ100 Matt in our chatroom says no offense but F Snatcher Zone of the Enders please.
5953704	5954745	Actdeft follows up with that.
5955206	5957229	Where's my third Zone of the Enders dammit?
5960709	5988726	Tiger Claw says my first video game soundtrack if you can call it that is the Mortal Kombat CD and I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack but the one by the Immortals oh god I forgot about that disc oh yeah I had that too I did have that that might have been my first one too I did have that I had the movie soundtrack too, the movie soundtrack was so awesome it was sick I think my first soundtrack was Gran Turismo and then I remember DDR 4th Mix
5990664	5991924	The other one I bought.
5992304	5993485	I bought that at a con.
5994285	5994585	Awesome.
5995405	5996885	Last tweet from Blue Swim.
5997465	6000686	If you could deep fry any candy bar, which one would it be?
6001606	6004707	Deep fried Milky Ways and Twix bars and Hershey's bars.
6005827	6008107	I've never had a deep fried candy bar, so I'm not sure how they taste.
6008127	6009087	I've had deep fried Snickers.
6009748	6010228	Was it good?
6010248	6011828	I could only eat half of it.
6011868	6012488	It made me sick.
6012648	6012828	I know.
6012868	6013908	It just sounds like too much.
6014789	6016429	I don't want any candy bar deep fried.
6016449	6017189	I want them frozen.
6017580	6021342	I would say Almond Joy, because I like Almond Joy a lot.
6021822	6023462	I like almond, coconut stuff.
6025163	6042970	Not a big fan of candy bars, but if we gotta pick something, it's not really a candy bar, but it's what happens when you leave a bag of, or I should say, let me correct this, a three pound bag of gummy bears in your car during the hot summer.
6043291	6045832	It forms into a giant gummy pillow.
6045852	6046472	Mecha gummy.
6046492	6046572	Yeah.
6047232	6055157	MechaGummy if you will, sort of a Tetsuo gone crazy MechaGummy or UltraGummy.
6055958	6063302	Take that, bread that, and dip it in so you have a nice gooey pillow of fried gummy.
6063882	6064543	Thank you for watching!
6085498	6086359	I want to deep fry those.
6087280	6088400	Deep fried Hello Kitties.
6088481	6090302	So much to deep fry nerds.
6091043	6091303	All right.
6091703	6092924	That's it for Twitter topics.
6093485	6094946	Bread every single one of them.
6095166	6095466	That's right.
6095486	6099169	We're getting way off topic, but twitter.com slash OLR.
6099410	6101031	Let's get back into some other gaming news.
6101791	6102052	Loki.
6102632	6103833	Yeah.
6104353	6112399	You know, speaking of abominations coming to Facebook, GameStop has decided, hey, you know what?
6112459	6114100	Facebook people are there, yeah?
6114561	6118744	So we're gonna put a storefront there and we're gonna sell shit there because, you know...
6120304	6121565	That's what we do.
6149452	6155674	So, liking GameStop, you better believe that they're going to be letting you know, hey, hey, there's a game pre-booking.
6156054	6156635	You want to buy it?
6156935	6157635	Hey, hey.
6158955	6159656	Hey, listen.
6159956	6160156	Hey.
6160216	6161696	Maybe you should pre-order something.
6162497	6163957	You know, we got pre-orders.
6164297	6165558	Come on in and pre-order things.
6165958	6169799	I hate going in there every time they're like, so, what game are you looking forward to?
6169879	6173040	Because I know that's, so, what game can I pre-order for you?
6173600	6173720	No.
6174601	6177082	And I tell them, I'm like, I'm not looking forward to anything.
6177642	6178162	I hate it all.
6179397	6180257	Why are you in here, dude?
6182238	6183879	Because I'm buying stuff that's come out.
6184299	6191982	I'm really at that point where, yeah, I just like to go to Best Buy or Fry's or some huge store that happens to have video games.
6192662	6193262	You know what I mean?
6194583	6197564	Unless it's like some collector's edition that's super exclusive.
6197604	6199284	You do not need to pre-order anything.
6199565	6201305	You can find them in stores.
6201385	6205807	It's just like, you know, oh, you better pre-order that 3DS because you'll never be able to find it.
6206525	6208166	No, they're all over the fucking place.
6208566	6210928	It's just... Just wait.
6212189	6212969	Be a little patient.
6214671	6217953	I know that sounds really ridiculous coming from me, but seriously.
6219834	6223417	You, mister, I'm gonna pay 200 bucks for Motorstorm Apocalypse.
6224818	6225158	No.
6225238	6225918	Be patient.
6226399	6226739	No.
6226759	6230401	Huh?
6230481	6231602	It's a collector's item, okay?
6232143	6232843	Mm-hmm.
6233864	6234964	Mister, I'm gonna import my 3DS.
6237741	6238262	You know what?
6238282	6239843	I actually... I sold that, okay?
6239863	6241844	Did you make your money back?
6242264	6242464	Yes.
6242804	6243845	Wow, nice.
6243865	6245826	I would say that was awesome.
6245846	6247868	It was like renting a 3DS for a month.
6247888	6250749	Yeah, it worked out.
6253399	6256980	But yeah, I mean, so yeah, it's not a big surprise.
6257040	6261061	And of course, you know, they recently acquired Impulse and Spawn Labs.
6261181	6269223	So they're trying to make, I guess, as much of, make themselves as much in your face as possible.
6270903	6277224	And I guess, yeah, you'll be able to purchase reserve titles, view trailers, screenshots, and all that stuff.
6278005	6279905	So yeah.
6281926	6285810	Atari Games are new all over again.
6303908	6304628	Here's the deal.
6304868	6315011	You get a free shell of the game that comes with Pong for free just for downloading it, which obviously is one of the big Atari games ever, although it hasn't aged well at all.
6316011	6324053	But you can pick up a variety of addition packs for 99 cents each, and you can get extra games that come with them.
6324333	6326793	You can just buy all 100 freaking games for $14.99 if you want the old games.
6329694	6335259	Some of the games you can get, Tempest, Crystal Castles, Yars' Revenge, Combat, and so forth.
6335739	6340183	Now, usually you kind of look at this and go, great, yay, it's the same thing all over again.
6340523	6345728	But one of the cool things that it does have, you can do multiplayer over Bluetooth connections.
6346108	6347449	So that's kind of cool.
6347509	6349331	For some games.
6349371	6352813	Yeah, not everything, but for some of the games it has multiplayer over Bluetooth.
6353134	6353994	So that's kind of cool.
6354054	6355776	It's already more useful than GameRoom.
6357446	6357746	Sad.
6358747	6362869	Game Room could have been so good, but it's dead now.
6364930	6369673	They haven't officially canceled Game Room, but they also haven't put anything out for it since the end of last year.
6369773	6371293	It's left as a graveyard.
6371734	6372054	I know.
6372254	6372754	Sad face.
6376789	6377649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6403520	6411968	So maybe Sega's not upset about that, but it's really not so much of a remake as much as a new game.
6412188	6421917	It's using new code, has 103 stages, and playable characters from 1, 2, and 3 with new abilities and new characters.
6422537	6427041	There's new enemies based off of the Game Gear ones and cover illustrations.
6428002	6454790	are added on there there is boss rush volleyball AI partner mode and other modes and a level editor so I'm watching a little bit of this and it just looks pretty neat there's a scene where you're out running a bulldozer and you have to fight walls and you can actually fight the bulldozer too that's pretty funny I want to fight a bulldozer but not really
6455650	6458991	You just like kick the bulldozer and it goes backwards and then you go back to kicking the wall some more.
6460551	6461691	And then the bulldozer knocks you over.
6461751	6463132	Man versus bulldozer.
6463672	6464252	Film at 11.
6466612	6466932	Awesome.
6468073	6468773	Kind of cool.
6468793	6470233	Damn those knee-high walls.
6472274	6473274	Always getting my way.
6474814	6477435	Someone driving a bulldozer through a building is what I want to know.
6478055	6479215	Guess I'll have to play the game to find out.
6479924	6482927	Oh, I remembered a game I did play this week because it was on sale.
6482947	6484189	It was the X-Men Arcade game.
6484209	6485550	I don't think I talked about this last week.
6485610	6486071	No, go ahead.
6486572	6487653	Yeah, the X-Men Arcade game.
6487913	6493239	Yeah, it was, you know, better in my memories as sadly a lot of the retro classics end up being.
6493419	6493579	Yeah.
6493920	6494580	Not all of them though.
6494861	6496943	Pitfall 2, still as awesome as I remember.
6497063	6497444	Just saying.
6498124	6499786	But some other games were better in my memory.
6500907	6501128	Anyhow.
6502268	6513792	I'm kind of, well, actually I'm not too excited about Mortal Kombat, but it is neat to see that there's some stuff coming to the 360 since the PlayStation 3 version does get Kratos.
6514813	6520775	The 360 though, and this is all considered to be rumor, although they do have some screenshots that kind of confirm that.
6521675	6523296	Thanks for watching!
6536820	6542985	Um, also an arena called the Pit 360, which is a remake of, uh, Mortal Kombat 3's The Pit 3.
6543986	6551291	And additionally, I guess, uh, they're saying that the DLC character Lady in Red will be offered as a free download for Xbox Live users for a limited time.
6552432	6557776	Um, also Mortal Kombat themed avatar gear available for purchase on Xbox Live as well.
6558957	6559057	Um...
6560618	6568407	No confirmation on everything, but there are some screenshots that kind of show the pit and these avatars watching the fight.
6568567	6570849	So it's a little interesting, I guess.
6571810	6580520	And then on top of that, you may remember the Mortal Kombat kind of pitch for a new reimagining movie.
6581060	6584382	of the movie series, which I really wish would have happened, but it didn't.
6584563	6587825	But instead, it became this now web series that's going to be going on.
6588525	6592788	And apparently, the premiere of this web series is going to be on the 12th.
6592828	6594209	That's right, on Tuesday.
6594950	6603375	And you can check it out, the first episode of that, including, you know, Michael Jai White's supposed to be in that still.
6603795	6608298	And it's going to have eight episodes, I guess, leading up to the April 19th launch day.
6611120	6612161	Yeah, you can check that out.
6612221	6615144	It's going to be on Machima.com.
6615844	6617205	It's probably going to be really gross.
6618486	6620308	I should show it to my mom so she can watch it.
6620348	6621549	This is gross, Rob.
6621569	6622370	What are you making me watch?
6622390	6623190	This is sick.
6623731	6625552	I think I would definitely want to check it out.
6625572	6626253	It looked pretty cool.
6627014	6627914	Yeah, it does look pretty cool.
6628315	6629456	Again, can't explain it.
6629596	6632198	I hate the Saw movies, yet I love Mortal Kombat, even when it's gross.
6633359	6637002	But there'll probably be nothing as over-the-top as what you see in the game in these movies.
6637042	6641846	I don't think I'm going to see Mileena ripping off someone's face and eating their tongue and then spiking the head on the ground.
6641866	6642827	It'd be awesome.
6643829	6668322	I did get to see the subway fatality oh yeah that's awesome it's like he holds her head on the subway so that their heads go through all the windows oh yeah and then he throws them in front of another train it's awesome you know what they should have done which have been kind of fun as like a parody of you know some of the other fighting game series do uh Mortal Kombat Extreme Beach Volleyball and actually have that where they take someone's head and spike in the ground and
6669437	6671257	Make it really ridiculously bloody.
6672058	6672338	Let's see.
6672378	6673478	Let me look at this here real quick.
6673498	6674338	Let's see if this is it.
6675559	6675839	Here we go.
6675879	6677999	Here we go.
6678139	6680420	There you go.
6680440	6682801	And there it goes.
6683161	6683761	Oncoming train.
6685301	6687162	That's awesome.
6688662	6693163	They showed a lot of... What I was looking at was the x-ray vision in the moves.
6693203	6695004	Yeah, those are like the special moves that you can do.
6695084	6695624	It's pretty cool.
6696304	6696644	I don't know.
6697005	6700186	I didn't like the demo at first, but it really started growing on me.
6700206	6702127	And I think the final game is going to do that too.
6702288	6702668	So we'll see.
6703108	6705449	So I'm going to definitely check that out when it comes out.
6706050	6706690	So, pretty cool.
6708731	6709331	Portal news.
6709712	6710912	Because Portal 2 is on the way.
6711052	6714755	I was really shocked to see that this game is literally around the corner.
6715095	6719397	Speaking of this whole driving through San Francisco thing, they have a lot of video game billboards in San Francisco.
6719437	6720658	I don't know if you know this.
6721138	6723199	I saw a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 billboard.
6723239	6724360	I saw a Super Street Fighter 2 billboard.
6724700	6726621	My birthday is April 19th, everybody!
6750197	6760019	Well, anyhow, to wrap up for your birthday, DarkSakura, in anticipation of Portal 2, there is a comic that's out now, Portal 2 Lab Rat.
6760439	6762319	That's right, it's a comic that you can read through.
6762939	6767980	It's on IGN Comics at comics.ign.com, and you can check that out.
6768080	6772581	It's a free comic, so if you want to read that, maybe that's something you can talk about on Comic Insanity.
6772621	6776382	I don't know if you do the whole virtual comics, but Portal 2 might be a good excuse.
6776462	6776622	Yeah.
6778132	6786035	Also of note, Joko, Jonathan Colton, of course, doing the music for Portal 2, I believe he's contributing to that as well, right?
6786095	6788176	Wasn't, didn't I use something he's doing, something like that?
6788196	6794218	Well, there is a new Portal, I'm sorry, a new version of Portals still alive that's going to be coming out.
6794578	6799600	I don't know if this is with regards to Portal 2 or what, but this is coming out through Twitter.
6801462	6803944	Jonathan Coulton, Still Alive, Sarah Quinn, Tegan and Sarah
6819477	6820098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6844079	6845841	There's something else super cool in this, Rob.
6845881	6846802	What else do you want to say?
6847002	6847623	Theremin!
6847743	6850265	That's right, there's a Theremin solo on the new album.
6850325	6850546	Woo!
6850666	6851346	Theremin!
6851967	6855510	Unfortunately, the new album isn't due out until 2013.
6856511	6857913	So this will be a little bit of a wait.
6858513	6860435	So I guess maybe this new track isn't for Portal 2.
6861176	6861777	Sad face.
6862838	6864860	I'm sure there'll be some new song from the game, though.
6864900	6866041	Everybody's all crazy over.
6866381	6866882	Theremin!
6869136	6869797	Awesome.
6869837	6871798	Maybe something with Cave Johnson singing.
6872899	6874500	The new character that's in the game.
6875641	6879444	The CEO of Aperture Science or something like that.
6879665	6884849	Which, by the way, speaking of your rant earlier, did you notice there's some bonus from getting it at GameStop?
6884869	6886971	There's some unlockable character.
6887331	6888272	I've seen the commercials.
6888332	6889533	It's not even an unlockable character.
6889573	6891094	It's a skin for your character.
6891995	6897459	Seriously, people, if you're all getting raging boners over a fucking skin...
6898820	6903223	I'm sorry, but like the pre-order bonuses for like stuff nowadays are really kind of terrible.
6903864	6905905	Like, you know, oh, you get this.
6906185	6909268	Instead of the gun being silver, it's gold now.
6909528	6911849	Whoa, gold.
6912190	6914691	That way all my friends know I'm a consumer whore.
6915232	6916373	It's an EP and something.
6916453	6917373	I have something you don't have.
6917533	6922517	No, it's not something that you don't have because everybody's ordering at the same place, so they're all going to have it.
6922697	6925538	Okay, so I was watching South Park the other day randomly.
6925838	6928198	It was on TV, and there was a commercial for the new Mortal Kombat.
6928278	6935099	And it was a commercial for people at GameStop to get the new Mortal Kombat because you get the scorpion skin, the classic scorpion skin with it.
6935579	6938320	And they did this whole Mashima thing with it, which was kind of funny.
6938600	6939640	Yeah, they've been doing that now.
6940000	6946542	But what I thought was interesting about it is that Mileena was not wearing the costume that she has in the demo.
6946582	6948422	She was wearing classic Mileena outfits.
6948462	6948702	Yes.
6949142	6953347	So, classic Scorpion outfit is not going to be the only classic outfit that shows up in the game.
6953367	6954128	Yes, there's a ton of them.
6954409	6954689	Oh, yeah.
6955230	6956752	Are they all going to be download content, though?
6956972	6962519	No, some of them, I think, actually came with the... I think some come with the game.
6962899	6967345	Like, there may be, like, a code to download one of them, but they're going to be offered later on as...
6969406	6971366	from what I've seen in places.
6971586	6973287	Yes, there's plenty of skins coming.
6973487	6978408	But the new Mileena shows way more boobies than the old one did.
6978749	6982350	And with all the gross stuff that goes on in the game, she's like smearing blood on her boobies.
6982450	6984050	It's really gross, but funny.
6984390	6985231	This is Mortal Kombat.
6985271	6986171	Mortal Kombat is funny.
6988064	6991127	Speaking of hilarious, let's go to the email bag.
6991627	6993269	Every week you guys send us emails.
6993689	6997112	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and the hilarity ensues.
6997492	7000715	DarkSakura, stop shopping on Steam.
7000855	7001936	I'm not stopping.
7002076	7002877	Shopping.
7002917	7003698	I'll never stop.
7004761	7005962	I'll never stop shopping.
7006662	7007582	Shopping's actually good for you.
7007622	7008102	Did you know that?
7008823	7009683	It's very therapeutic.
7009723	7010363	No, it's not.
7010383	7012964	Whenever I get pissed off, I go to the outlets and spend $300.
7013004	7013665	I feel much better.
7015365	7018827	First email says, Hello, all our great show.
7018847	7021008	I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the following.
7021648	7024369	The Streets of Rage remake project.
7024509	7025730	Yeah, we just covered this.
7025970	7026250	Oops.
7026730	7029632	8 year old fan project by some very talented guys from Spain.
7029652	7033214	The graphics were all redrawn, levels were upgraded or extended, and music got remixed.
7033654	7034655	The remake is free.
7034715	7035936	I'm not affiliated with these people.
7037697	7040259	But he sent the link to it, so I figured I would link it in the chat room.
7041019	7041679	Thank you, Carlos.
7042000	7042640	Well, there you go.
7042800	7047203	Another endorsement for that project that folks have been eagerly anticipating.
7047631	7047811	Hi, OLR!
7047832	7050276	I think this is from Spazinator.
7059830	7062351	Since he's banned from Twitter, he's turned to the email bag.
7064772	7069975	I just wanted to point out a couple of relatively minor stories for the three of you.
7070495	7075998	First, there are four new free TV shows, all of which are available on both PSN as well as Xbox Live's Zune Marketplace.
7076418	7079900	Finding them is just a matter of looking under the free TV tabs on their respective systems.
7080540	7086143	A second story, or should I say non-story, I don't know, is that the PlayStation Network has been relatively severely...
7086983	7089106	was having relatively severe issues this past Tuesday.
7089506	7097054	While Sony has indeed acknowledged that there was an issue by issuing a statement via the US PlayStation blog, they have remained rather tight-lipped about the cause of the issue.
7097114	7102841	However, it is commonly believed that the issues with PSN were caused by a DDoS attack by a group called Anonymous, which we covered earlier.
7103461	7110144	I don't think that's... Well, you know, to be fair, these emails come in during the week, but I don't think it's really, like, rumor.
7110244	7111345	I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed.
7111405	7111865	They did it.
7112665	7113386	They took credit.
7113626	7116327	Supposedly, they're upset over the fact that Sony is taking GeoHot to court.
7116427	7116627	Yes.
7117728	7121429	If I know Loki as well as I think I do, I'll beat him to the proverbial punch and say this.
7121469	7122990	Somebody call the Wambulance.
7123930	7124191	Oh, no.
7124271	7126752	Sony is protecting their interest in suing a hacker.
7126812	7127172	Wah.
7127252	7127792	I show them.
7128593	7128853	Okay.
7128913	7131474	That wasn't quite a Loki rant, but it was a reasonable approximation.
7131494	7131754	I don't know.
7131914	7132874	I don't think so.
7157560	7158580	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7184244	7191810	To continue, side note, I have no way to verify this either way, but supposedly Anonymous has issued a statement, which I will paraphrase.
7192371	7198296	We wholeheartedly believe in Geohot's cause and believe he is unjustly be persecuted.
7198696	7200337	We will fight for you until Sony relents.
7200397	7201278	We will never give you up.
7201318	7202199	We will never let you down.
7202219	7203440	We will never run around and desert you.
7204000	7205201	Okay, last part was BS.
7205261	7212787	That was a variation of a 4chan joke where a discussion morphs from one topic to quoting Fresh Prince of Bel-Air just that I submitted Rick Astley for Fresh Prince.
7213107	7214908	This email was brought to you by Old Ass Jokes.
7216769	7217070	That's it.
7218391	7218751	Alright.
7220575	7221536	That does it for emails.
7222436	7228399	Unfortunately, both about topics we already covered on the show tonight, but hey, it's wherever a gamer has a voice, so send in your voices.
7228760	7232162	Chances are, though, if it's a big news story, we probably are going to hit it at some point.
7232202	7234443	You know, it is a three-hour show, just for the record.
7234763	7241207	So if you're going to email us, and that's okay, don't let that discourage you from emailing us about a big topic, a news story, but just tell us, what are your thoughts?
7241407	7242127	Are you excited?
7242167	7242647	Are you happy?
7242687	7243148	Are you sad?
7243188	7243588	Are you mad?
7244248	7245189	Tell us what you think about it.
7245911	7247696	Alright, let's see.
7247796	7250042	Let's go on to the FUs of the week.
7250163	7252008	Every week we like to get angsty.
7252489	7253291	So let's do that right now.
7268866	7269006	Loki.
7269026	7269186	Loki.
7292463	7320551	I hate doing this and this I really I'm so sad about it but fuck you to the squeeze in and the reason why is because I've been looking forward to for years trying a squeeze with cheese and just you know it looks so delicious on TV and stuff like that I finally went to the one that they just put in in Roseville and I gotta say that burger was fucking terrible it was it just
7321371	7324514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7345231	7346212	Good luck with that, honey.
7346272	7352881	As you close your eyes, and then you get knocked out, left in the desert to die without any legs.
7352941	7354903	That's basically what this was about.
7354963	7356806	It's like, huh, I wasn't expecting that.
7357246	7358668	That's basically...
7360729	7361629	Smash, or not Smash.
7361669	7363610	Oops, why is the outro to the show playing?
7363650	7365390	My bad.
7365470	7366010	Show's over.
7366090	7368771	It's basically, I mean, it was such a disappointment.
7368911	7371472	I don't understand the draw to it at all.
7372832	7376793	Maybe it was a bad burr or something, but, you know, everybody else seemed happy about it.
7376813	7380694	It's just, I could do better myself, man.
7380774	7385975	I mean, if all it is is putting a lot of cheese on something, fuck, dude, I can put a lot of cheese on something.
7388786	7397273	My FU of the week would go to probably moving.
7398073	7400135	Don't get me wrong, I'm really happy to be moving.
7400395	7404498	The new place has so much more space than my old place did, so that's really good because I have a lot of shit.
7405019	7410263	But my FU goes to having to move that shit is really a pain in the big fat ass.
7410523	7411764	You still have to move far.
7412779	7414081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7428459	7430922	I'm gonna do what I did next time I'm hiring movers again.
7431142	7432965	When I hired movers last time, it was great.
7434487	7436349	Except for the whole stuff that they weren't able to move.
7436970	7437250	Anyhow.
7438652	7439653	Let's move on, shall we?
7440014	7444099	Couple more news stories for you guys, and then, oh god, it's the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7447182	7450583	Uh, yes, another week, another class action lawsuit.
7450623	7466427	This time, it's towards EA, and I could have sworn that this hasn't been the first one, but apparently there is the, um, Madden lawsuit, and it's, um, this time it's not even necessarily just Madden, but it's EA Sports, Madden NCAA, and Arena Football.
7467327	7470568	Um, apparently that there is a case, uh, P...
7471968	7492346	um pickover versus electronic arts inc saying that EA's exclusive licenses foreclose competition in an alleged football video game market because the lack of competition the plaintiffs in the case claimed that this monopoly allowed EA to overcharge for its games even though EA sports games of course cost as much as you know all the other console games out there um
7494960	7503908	If you're interested in possibly participating in this, you can go to easportslitigation.com and check out the information regarding that.
7503928	7507952	Apparently, this would qualify if you bought an EA Sports football game between 2005 and now.
7514908	7518389	Yeah, X-Link was telling me about this because I guess he got an email about it on WoW.
7518509	7521550	And there was a part of me that was kind of like, is this like a phishing thing?
7521690	7523631	Or is this, I guess it is a real deal.
7523831	7524151	No, it's real.
7524171	7524951	Class action lawsuit.
7525451	7529333	You know, they give the options, you know, you can remain a class member.
7529633	7533234	And it says you do not need to take any further action at this time.
7533254	7534754	You'll automatically remain a class member.
7537055	7540276	Or you can exclude yourself and do all that stuff.
7540296	7540376	Yeah.
7541237	7542138	I've seen this a lot.
7542238	7546783	I got one from 24 Hour Fitness one time, and it was crap.
7546803	7548445	It was like, oh, you get three weeks free.
7548526	7550328	It's like, I don't want to go back there.
7551629	7552410	Whoops, excuse me.
7555256	7558278	I'm having a lot of technical fail tonight, I apologize for that.
7559819	7560960	Well, I'm surprised, Rob.
7561040	7562942	This episode's supposed to be squeaky clean.
7563042	7563522	I know, it's 409.
7564983	7566384	It's really broken and dirty.
7567085	7569507	Alright, well, since I already played a part of it, let me play it here.
7569887	7572929	I had no idea this was in the DVD.
7573009	7574591	Is this in the Tron Legacy DVD?
7574611	7576272	There's an ad for the new Commodore 64.
7577973	7581396	I guess that it's coming out because it's this whole Tron thing.
7581857	7586241	It talks about, you know, more colors and better sound and so forth.
7586681	7589764	And then all of a sudden... I didn't see that.
7591025	7592386	And we watched like a bunch of stuff.
7593807	7596149	And there's a whole Commodore computer coming out.
7597391	7601054	Now, we talked about this on the show before, that the Commodore 64 is being rebooted.
7603857	7605638	Maybe that was something special they did for you, I don't know.
7605658	7607840	I think that's something that's probably like a TV commercial.
7607880	7609681	Perhaps, but this is still awesome.
7609721	7611403	CommodoreUSA.net if you want to get it.
7611743	7613684	They are Commodore PCs.
7614025	7616226	The Commodore 64, the pricing is announced.
7616246	7617507	That's what's made these big.
7617768	7621170	The Commodore 64 is going to start at $595 US dollars.
7621530	7624373	The VIC Pro will be $895 US dollars.
7624733	7627695	And the VIC Slim will be $395 US dollars.
7628055	7631538	Now it doesn't quite say exactly what all is coming with these products.
7631899	7633482	Let me see if the website has more details on this.
7633502	7635887	It's an Intel Atom processor, so think Netbook.
7638672	7641114	Aw, that kind of sucks, if that's the case.
7641334	7643495	Okay, yay, you're showing me the damn preview again.
7643515	7644876	Let me see here, let me go to the site.
7644896	7650760	Yeah, think Netbook and think, you know, it's going to have an emulator for Commodore games on there.
7651841	7663548	Let's see, the classic recreated Commodore 64, one 12-volt DC jack, one PS2 keyboard mouse connectors, one HDMI, one DVI-D, one VGA, four USB slots.
7663568	7664769	Go to tech configurations.
7665569	7666510	Let's see, tech.
7671593	7683021	I can guarantee you right there, those boards, because they're all integrated boards, they go for about maybe $200 at the most.
7684022	7691627	That sucks, because I'll tell you, I'm not even going to lie, I really want one of these, because I love my Commodore 64, and this is what they're selling it on, too.
7691647	7694689	You can seriously build one of those cheaper than that.
7694709	7694829	I know.
7696613	7702024	Yeah, the real tech audio that's built in, the Ethernet's all built into the stupid board.
7702645	7706353	Do they even include anything else other than how much RAM was in it again?
7709280	7712123	Two DDR2s, up to 4 gigs.
7712724	7714146	Two single channel slots.
7716409	7720474	DDR2, old slow ass RAM compared to nowadays stuff.
7722396	7726782	Let me see what's in that VIC Pro, because I guess there's the VIC Pro that's coming out as well.
7727162	7729463	See, but this doesn't have that same nostalgia factor for me.
7729523	7730464	See, that's a little bit different, though.
7730584	7734046	See, this one, though, actually has a dual or quad-core processor built into it.
7734646	7737668	So, that's a little bit better.
7737828	7742290	Now, were the... How big was the Commodore 64 keyboard?
7742310	7743751	I mean, was that pretty big, or was it...
7744191	7746772	Well, they were monsters because the computer was inside the keyboard.
7746832	7747132	Yeah.
7747352	7748592	So they were pretty big keyboards.
7748612	7752314	I don't understand why they can't fit a bigger, better computer in there.
7752354	7753414	Well, it's probably the price.
7753754	7759916	You know, they're trying to... Obviously, they want to profit off these and, you know... Yeah, but I mean, hell, when I was building my...
7760676	7761697	main cabinet stuff.
7761737	7765079	I mean, they're like dual core, you know, Intel chips.
7765179	7773523	It's like dual core 2.8 gigahertz chips, you know, with two gigs of RAM and a decent hard drive and stuff.
7773543	7774523	And I built those under $200.
7775944	7778445	So they can't do that.
7778586	7786690	I mean, and that's, you know, hell, you could probably find that stuff even cheaper, especially if you're like Commodore or somebody making...
7787779	7804763	you know, a massive amount of computers I mean, you're not just a consumer like myself I don't know but, yeah, whatever you're paying for nostalgia maybe licensing for Commodore alright maybe having to remake those computers
7805546	7811274	Well, probably it's nostalgia, it's the original emulator, they're trying to get some value out of that too.
7811294	7819886	You know, obviously they want to make a profit off it, but they want to cash in on old folks like me who have the nostalgia going with the Commodore 64.
7822029	7822650	That's what it is.
7823035	7824496	All right, let's go to the Skype line.
7824596	7826357	Every week we open up the Skype line.
7827037	7832320	Excuse me, take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use an email on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7832640	7833881	The Skype line is open now.
7833901	7836703	We're going to have to wait a minute and a half for the chat room to hear that.
7837723	7839764	Well, we could also post in the chat room.
7839864	7840765	I'm going to do that right now.
7840945	7841865	Send call now.
7842066	7846268	Yeah, Loki, go ahead and read us some last-minute stories while I post that.
7846576	7850480	Sony has thought of a great idea for the PlayStation Move.
7850520	7851901	Hey, you know what sells more Move?
7852482	7853383	More iPad.
7853823	7857787	That's right, there's an iPad sequel coming out because you know the first one wasn't terrible enough.
7857847	7861010	So this iPad sequel comes with Friends.
7861390	7865054	That's right, you'll be able to have two players and two iPads at the same time.
7865474	7868317	You can be able to create your own content as well.
7868997	7870779	They're saying that I guess you can either
7870879	7871600	Thanks for watching!
7887446	7887786	PSX for Droid
7905957	7911760	It says the original Sony complaint only had to do with the trademark logo that he had put on the app's icon.
7912981	7917843	But since then, I guess Google has closed both his Android Market and checkout accounts.
7918003	7921825	So he's leaving him unable to publish any apps.
7922285	7924086	So he's self-publishing the app now.
7924166	7932110	So if you want to download the free app and then go find your ISOs, you can do that and avoid paying $7 per PlayStation 1 game.
7935101	7936300	God, I love that stuff
7938482	7939783	And finally, this is kind of cool.
7940243	7941604	Well, Evil Dead.
7941764	7944567	They're making a game now for the iPhone and iPad.
7944647	7947889	It's going to be a 3D action shooter.
7948449	7950071	It's supposed to be coming out very soon.
7950431	7954634	It kind of features these chibi characters.
7955615	7957536	Chibi Bruce Campbell.
7957696	7960518	It's supposed to be out for, I guess, $2.99 on the iPhone, $4.99 on the iPad.
7960538	7960939	And 30 chapters.
7960959	7961219	And I guess...
7968291	7969332	Lots of stuff.
7969432	7972553	It looked like the movie, but very chibi.
7973253	7983158	And then I guess it's being developed by Trigger Apps, who's made a bunch of different movie-based games for the iPhone and Android, including the Karate Kid, Green Hornet, G.I.
7983198	7985059	Joe, and Couples Retreat.
7987720	7989681	That Couples Retreat looked like a terrible movie.
7989986	7990366	The Governator
8014428	8022855	So he's putting out a comic and of course they're doing a cartoon series and apparently that cartoon series is going to become a movie and possibly a game.
8023535	8028779	And Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing the voice and I don't get it.
8029179	8029900	It looks stupid.
8031341	8032222	It looks so cheesy.
8034239	8035860	Thanks for watching!
8053147	8054868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8081701	8084163	One of my favorite soundtracks, like, ever on the Commodore 64.
8084244	8086265	It was Escape from Sinja's Castle.
8086285	8088407	It was like the second half of the scenes.
8089388	8099538	But the thing about the Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair is that it wasn't, like, they couldn't make the Laserdisc, obviously, so they had to make little mini-games out of all the scenes.
8099798	8101740	So, like, this one was a rowing game.
8102040	8102461	and many more.
8122142	8124703	And he had to jump over the holes in the floor.
8125203	8126464	It was a very tricky balancing.
8126484	8128404	See how he keeps moving forward slightly?
8128745	8131326	It's because if you let it keep going, he'll just fall off the back.
8131666	8132726	And he slips and falls.
8134207	8137928	And then there's some random scenes that are inspired by the actual arcade game.
8138208	8139289	Let me see if I can get to one of those.
8141089	8144051	See, like, this is... The hand's coming up, so he has to jump left.
8144231	8146291	Things like that.
8146311	8148852	This was, like, one of my favorite 164 games.
8148872	8149713	It was so awesome.
8151354	8153616	Anyhow, just taking a trip down memory lane, that's all.
8154297	8156139	Any other last minute stories while no one calls?
8156759	8157821	I like to party.
8158461	8164888	There's a new indie game coming out on the Xbox Marketplace called Avatar Legends.
8165048	8170033	It's going to be a role-playing game, I guess by the developer Barker's Crest.
8170793	8197951	and it actually looks kind of cool it's going to be a 10 hour single player game co-op and multiplayer for up to 6 people a level and quest editor and you can create missions to share them with your friends but you also play as your avatar and you actually get full control over them so that kind of looks neat and I guess it says you can even drop people from your friends list into the game's NPC and set up different multiplayer and stuff
8198860	8200040	Cherry Blossoms are in bloom.
8227798	8228438	Is everything okay?
8229379	8229879	Yeah, apparently.
8229899	8231399	She's like, I'm going to call you back and leave a message.
8231839	8232380	Oh, okay.
8233500	8236701	I thought, she's never called during the show before, and I was like, oh, emergency.
8237141	8238061	But I guess it's not that bad.
8238081	8239982	Oh, no, the baby has started to move.
8241682	8242923	That could be it.
8242963	8244703	Maybe the baby's getting a little more mobile.
8244763	8245144	Who knows?
8245644	8246884	How are things going with the baby?
8248024	8249385	He's doing okay.
8250005	8251586	He's wiggly.
8251606	8252966	He wants to...
8254611	8261356	Roll around and not sleep, and he acts like he's teething, but there's nothing really coming in, so.
8262577	8268101	I don't know, we took him to the park today, and that's pretty much it.
8268942	8270283	All right, we're finally getting some calls.
8270323	8271604	Let's go to the phone and take them.
8271664	8272625	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8272645	8272985	Who's this?
8273946	8274366	Hi, guys.
8274386	8275427	This is DDR Dollar Bill.
8275587	8276848	Wow, he's really quiet.
8276888	8278209	Is it just, let me check your levels.
8278509	8279650	I don't know if it's just here in studio.
8279910	8280931	How are you doing, DDR Dollar Bill?
8281744	8282705	Oh, doing alright.
8283025	8284566	Just figured I'd give a call and say hi.
8284726	8287587	Hi, you are kind of quiet, but I think we can deal.
8287627	8288888	You're not, like, unhearable.
8289328	8289608	What's up?
8289648	8290089	What's on your mind?
8291009	8291690	Oh, nothing.
8291810	8300535	I was trying to find a topic to talk about because I didn't want to call and turn into a bitchfest about Killer Instinct because I absolutely hated that game with a furious passion.
8300675	8301295	Hey, you know what?
8301335	8304437	It's where every gamer has a voice, so some of us like Killer Instinct.
8304557	8306138	Why do you hate Killer Instinct?
8307202	8322102	This was back when I started developing a real hatred of fighting games, especially with something like Kill Instinct where it was just memorizing bullshit amount of combos to the point of where my physics exam was easier than Kill Instinct.
8323744	8337191	But what about the whole, like, and I don't know if this is just Killer Instinct 2, but I thought Killer Instinct 1 had this too, where if you kind of just knew, like, the basics, like, you know, the cross, the X pattern, and, you know, you could do some pretty decent combos just knowing the patterns.
8337451	8339092	Like, it wasn't like Mortal Kombat, dude.
8339112	8343594	Like, Mortal Kombat 3, you really had to memorize combos in order to get through that game.
8343874	8344394	You know what I mean?
8344494	8354739	It was to the point where when I fired up Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox last week, I still remembered a seven-hit cabal combo just because I had to memorize it like 10 years ago, you know?
8355759	8361762	Yeah, for Mortal Kombat 3, I'll agree with that because I've only memorized one character, and that was Sindel.
8362302	8363523	Dude, Sindel was awesome.
8363563	8367064	Yes, it was like low kick, low kick, high punch, high punch, uppercut.
8367084	8369886	Yeah, I used to know all the stuff for Sindel too.
8369906	8370466	She was awesome.
8371471	8374592	Yeah, and that was the only count I played, and I was like, eh, whatever.
8374912	8377953	They had some really dopey fatalities in Mortal Kombat 3, though.
8378193	8383715	Like, wasn't one of her fatalities where, like, she whips them in her, like, she literally whips her hair back and forth.
8384035	8392138	Like, she whips them up in a little, like, ice cream cone looking thing and then whips her hair back and it just, it unravels the body and all the bones go flying.
8392158	8393479	Like, it's really stupid.
8393779	8396680	Like, Mortal Kombat 3 was when it got really cartoony, you know what I mean?
8397409	8401415	Yeah, especially when her second one was when she screamed and your skin just came off.
8401435	8402637	I was like, okay.
8405250	8434601	yeah but there's also the thing also was that this came out also the same time around as the Virtua Fighter series was coming out and Virtua Fighter what I loved about that over things like Killer Instinct even Street Fighter was it just felt more natural to play like it just everything felt better at the time you know like I really felt like I was actually for a time I felt like oh wow my moves actually carried out it made sense not just memorizing combos and x y z magic pattern whatever right you know
8435310	8438213	and that's why I kind of had a really big dislike for it.
8438773	8447060	That and I got into a fist fight over some jackass in my college who was a whole stupid argument about it and I ended up punching him.
8447240	8449182	You got into a fist fight over this?
8449923	8456048	Yeah, because he was like, yeah, I remember also that this kid was acting all bullshit gangster.
8456528	8457669	In other words, he had it coming.
8457829	8462874	I was like, shut up and back and forth and I just like punched him and walked away.
8463274	8466355	Wow, have you ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game?
8466435	8468896	DarkSakura, have you ever punched some bitch over a video game?
8469616	8470536	I punched my brother.
8470976	8471637	Did you really?
8472057	8474477	Yeah, because we were playing Super Street Fighter 4.
8474817	8475718	Not 4, why am I saying 4?
8475758	8476258	Super Street Fighter 2.
8477558	8480319	When my brothers were still, you know, younger.
8480959	8484580	And he totally, totally, totally tried to grab my controller, so I punched him.
8484921	8485321	Wow.
8485881	8486381	Oh, damn.
8486421	8489642	Well, you know, it's the bitch let go of my controller.
8489982	8492923	But you've never punched another girl over a video game?
8493470	8494851	I didn't know any other girls that played.
8494871	8498192	And then, you know, hit them with pillows and then rubbed your boobies together.
8498372	8500934	No, I always played with dudes.
8501474	8501814	Okay.
8502054	8502955	But I'd punch them, too.
8503815	8505016	And they thought it was funny.
8505076	8510859	I've always thought my coworkers are going to do that to me during Grand Theft Auto because I really piss them off when I play with them.
8511339	8512239	But, no.
8512259	8515621	Yeah, I don't think I've ever gotten into physical altercation over a video game.
8515661	8519723	Like, I think, you know, I've thrown controllers and I've probably thrown controllers at people.
8520023	8520423	DarkSakura.com
8544037	8544277	Okay.
8545018	8546319	So did I. Don't feel bad.
8546519	8548701	Sorry, I think we got off track a little bit, DDR Dollar Bill.
8548741	8551363	Somehow we went to fist fight to condensation on the windows.
8551383	8551823	That's okay.
8552904	8553344	It's all right.
8553745	8560090	And then the second thing also what got me, what I also want to talk about was that you were talking about your love of Commodore 64 games.
8560230	8560490	Yes.
8561571	8570718	That actually what got me started into emulation because I never actually played a Commodore until they actually started emulating the games, you know, I'd say in the mid-90s.
8570738	8570978	Mm-hmm.
8572459	8588132	and that's when I really started getting into it and the strangest thing was I actually was collecting magazines from England about Commodore games well because the Commodore 64 was huge over there I mean I would like to think it was pretty big in the US but it was huge in the UK huge
8588974	8589855	Oh, definitely.
8590755	8594218	The two magazines were The Games Machine and Zap64.
8595559	8600503	And it was through those magazines that I actually downloaded a few games.
8600603	8606087	And that's when I found two of my all-time favorite freaking soundtracks, as you were saying.
8606127	8610951	You said Dragon Slayer Escape from the Ninja Slave was a good soundtrack, and I'm agreeing with that one.
8610991	8611912	It was really cool.
8612332	8612852	What else, though?
8613593	8614434	My favorite all-time?
8614934	8615635	Last Ninja 2.
8618052	8620835	Dude, the last Ninja, those were some awesome games.
8621355	8622556	Yeah, absolutely.
8622576	8625639	The second one though, the music was just, oh my god, phenomenal.
8625819	8627521	Let's see if we can get some of the music here from this game.
8627561	8632886	I don't know if we, this is some gameplay video, so I don't know how much, I can't remember how much soundtrack was in the actual game.
8632926	8633987	Let's see if we can get to here.
8634948	8637690	The first one was my favorite, Central Park, the first level.
8637850	8638831	That was really good.
8641934	8643836	Trying to play some of the music here from it.
8647153	8648794	No, this thing's like muted or something.
8649434	8650035	Boring.
8650555	8651596	Well, there's Amiga.
8651776	8653076	Let's see this Amiga version here.
8653256	8653657	Let's see.
8653677	8654697	Yeah, that's the Amiga version.
8654717	8654957	Hold on.
8654977	8656378	Let me see if we have the Commodore 64 one.
8656398	8657139	Commodore 64 Long Play Part 1.
8657239	8657699	Here we go.
8657759	8658139	Ah, yes.
8658179	8660320	This is what I remember too.
8677219	8678140	Let's fast forward a little bit.
8678841	8682385	There's like a whole cinematic opening.
8688432	8689273	Oh, this is The Last Ninja 3.
8689974	8690435	My bad.
8690695	8692677	Oh, I would try it to be, actually.
8692717	8693538	I would try 1 and 2.
8695580	8696020	Usagi Yojimbo
8722594	8723575	Oh, this is the rabbit samurai thing.
8723595	8724055	Yeah, Usagi Yojimbo.
8724075	8724375	Oh, got it.
8755250	8755750	There you go.
8756171	8757031	Alright, very cool.
8758212	8758592	Yeah.
8759192	8761414	People are still using Commodore 64s to make music.
8761474	8761954	It's awesome.
8763015	8772520	I know, and it's like, when you think about the way, the fact that it has about, it's supposedly about the same hardware, I'm going to say, as Nintendo, but they did a lot more with the music.
8772580	8774141	It just blows my mind apart.
8775082	8775462	Absolutely.
8776229	8780910	Alright, well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to try to take at least one more call here, but have a good one, okay, buddy?
8781490	8782311	You too, thanks a lot, guys.
8782331	8786892	Alright, thanks for the reminiscing of the Commodore 64 classics, and don't get into any more fistfights over a game.
8787872	8788552	I'll try not to.
8788632	8789212	Alright, later.
8791293	8791673	Wow.
8792173	8797534	You know, I believe that kids fought over video games a long time ago, but I don't remember.
8798195	8801875	I played a lot of Street Fighter in the arcade, but I don't remember ever getting in a fistfight over it.
8802236	8803616	I remember a lot of trash-talking.
8804859	8807540	Any other last-minute stories that we got going on tonight?
8808040	8808180	No.
8808680	8809280	Oh, shit.
8809300	8810980	Uh-oh.
8812260	8812460	Huh?
8812520	8813821	I'm out of things to talk about.
8814301	8815681	Call us, people, damn it!
8815961	8817301	Well, it's a minute and a half delay.
8817561	8821842	So I posted it in chat, but it's going to take time before somebody gets through here.
8821862	8827783	We're going to need to have a list of things to talk about when the phones are dead or something.
8827903	8831384	Well, I've been doing a little bit of research, Rob, while we've been waiting for calls.
8832532	8834914	and if... Did we get a call?
8834954	8835635	Yes, we got a call.
8835675	8836176	So thank God.
8836336	8837977	We'll come back to your thought though after this.
8838177	8839038	Hi, you're on Orange Loss Radio.
8839058	8839379	Who's this?
8840119	8840540	Ziba.
8840900	8841421	Ziba.
8841521	8842281	How are you, my friend?
8842842	8843543	I'm doing good.
8844183	8846085	I heard you guys talk about Commodore 64 a lot.
8846325	8847486	I just wanted to give an update.
8847506	8849288	Of course we were because it's awesome.
8850589	8857737	Remember when I called, I think it was before Christmas or after Christmas or something, and I said I bought my boyfriend a Commodore 64?
8858418	8862443	Yes, yes, I do, because I remember telling you you were like the best girlfriend ever for doing that.
8862503	8863144	Yes, I do.
8864407	8874353	And then you guys told me I should look for something that will allow me to kind of use a flash card almost to play some games and do some stuff, but I actually did find something.
8874594	8875854	Oh, what'd you find?
8876095	8878476	It's called UIEC.
8879237	8892385	It's actually a, I guess this little SD card holder, and you actually hook it up to where the floppy drive hooks up to in the back of the Commodore, and...
8892825	8898027	And then you're actually able to put an SD card in it and save just like a floppy drive.
8898407	8900068	Oh my god, that sounds awesome.
8900368	8903229	And it actually comes with its own firmware and all this stuff.
8903789	8912072	And you can go online and get the hacked ROMs or whatever, the games, and you actually can put it on there and play them.
8913893	8918935	It's really hard to find ones that actually work.
8919075	8925279	Like you said, the Commodore 64 was really big in the UK and all those places in Europe.
8925919	8926800	Because it still is.
8927720	8930282	It still is?
8930582	8931162	I believe it.
8931683	8935625	There's actually conventions in Europe.
8935725	8936926	There's a lot of demo scenes.
8937646	8944194	Now, people are still coding on this thing and making their own little demo scenes.
8944234	8946957	And some people do some really awesome stuff.
8947919	8956529	And I've been trying to download some and play them, because you can do that too, but you can't play PAL demo scenes on US Commodore.
8957309	8971474	I'm actually thinking about getting a PAL Commodore 64 just so I can play games in the right speed because you can still play PAL games, but they play really fast because of the hertz difference and stuff, whatever.
8974255	8974435	Cybernoid 2
8991667	8992948	I remember Cybernoid.
8992968	8998050	They made an NES port of the original one, and it's not as good as the Commodore 64 one, to be honest.
8999131	9009836	I really like the music and just, you know, shooting little, like, I don't even know what the monsters are called because they're just like these little, I don't know, blobs.
9010857	9011637	But it's really fun.
9011818	9012498	I really like it.
9012778	9013038	Let's see.
9013078	9015780	I got a little bit of the gameplay here of Cybernoid 2.
9016900	9018161	This game was hard, too.
9019881	9027430	but there's lots of cheats that it came with so I still play with it but it's really fun.
9027975	9049843	you know why the Commodore 64 was so awesome is because it was a little bit ahead of its time in the fact that you could hook it up to a TV and so a lot of you didn't have to buy a separate monitor for it and I think that was part of what really drove it is that it was kind of like a gaming console computer I mean oh god whenever I think of the 80s I think of my Commodore 64 and just like having that made me the nerd I am it really did
9050441	9053642	We actually did have a hard time hooking up to TVs in here.
9054642	9059804	First, I was trying to use a Nintendo RF adapter, which didn't work very well.
9060364	9065006	So then I went online and I bought some cables and it worked, but it was all black and white.
9065746	9068508	So I was going crazy trying to find something.
9068608	9071150	Finally I went to Radio Shack and I got this adapter.
9072671	9078516	This little small adapter that allowed me to put a cable wire in it and then hook it up to the TV that way.
9079016	9087443	But even I was reading online people were having lots of troubles even putting it on a LCD TV because of the difference.
9087703	9088364	Oh sure.
9088624	9090045	Yeah, since the TVs are new.
9090405	9090986	Oh sure, I bet.
9091266	9096051	You know, and the old, from what I remember, I actually had a Commodore 64 monitor.
9096451	9103559	And what I remember of those cables, they were a little different because there were two video cable inputs and one audio.
9103899	9107883	And most RCA, the red, yellow, white, are two audio and one video.
9108143	9112067	And I think that's why a lot of people get black and white when they try to hook it up, is because of that.
9112868	9114229	So, yeah.
9114769	9120332	But I guess, I'm sure with this still being popular to develop today, people are figuring it out, you know?
9121652	9121852	So.
9123253	9123533	Alright.
9124434	9126535	Alright, well, thank you so much for the call, Ziba.
9126575	9129776	Is there anything else you want to get out there before we let you go so we can get more calls?
9130336	9131277	No, that's it.
9131557	9132397	Alright, take care, my friend.
9132417	9133258	You too.
9133338	9133818	Alright, bye-bye.
9134198	9134378	Bye.
9136335	9140558	I guess we'll let there be one more call here before we wrap things up.
9140758	9142459	Posted it to chat again to see if that will work.
9143620	9148102	Meanwhile, while we wait for that to come in, DarkSakura, what were we talking about a minute ago?
9148163	9150304	Oh, your project.
9150684	9152845	Yeah, I'm actually looking into logic board replacement.
9154907	9155187	Really?
9155586	9162611	Yeah, because you can't replace the processor because it's soldered into the logic board.
9163111	9165793	But you can replace the logic board with the processor on it.
9166453	9175719	So I'm actually now... My goal is to still get the OSX working and everything.
9176280	9179682	But this is actually turning out to be a little bit more fun than I thought it was going to be.
9180703	9184685	Because I can actually get a new logic board for about $100.
9186186	9186427	All right.
9186747	9187527	Let's go to the phones.
9187567	9188568	We have another call coming in.
9188608	9189649	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9189669	9190049	Who's this?
9190630	9191270	Hey, guys.
9191570	9191750	Hey.
9192671	9194632	This is DDR Angel, isn't it?
9194652	9194772	Hi.
9194792	9195353	Hi, guys.
9195573	9196594	Holy moly.
9196634	9198475	I haven't heard from you in forever.
9198535	9201257	Well, I mean, I've seen you on Twitter and all that stuff, Facebook and all that.
9201277	9205680	But I mean, having you on OLR, this is like old school.
9206240	9210483	I remember I wasn't the first episode you ever came to of OLR episode 20.
9211684	9212145	I think it was.
9212165	9213726	Something like that.
9214708	9218492	It was when OLR expanded from a two-hour show to a three-hour show officially.
9218532	9219013	I remember that.
9219033	9220655	Actually, it was when you were in that big house.
9220695	9221155	I don't remember.
9221235	9222176	That was like 2003 or something.
9222577	9223778	It was a long time ago.
9223798	9225861	I think we've had like seven different studios since then.
9225901	9228304	Yeah, that was when I lived with a guy named Brian.
9228324	9229906	That was many years ago.
9229946	9230446	Ten years ago.
9232148	9232968	Crazy stuff.
9233148	9235550	I just called because the Skype line was open.
9235570	9237170	I didn't really have anything I wanted to say.
9237310	9238911	Well, you're lucky.
9242473	9247455	It's funny because now that people realize it's open, we're getting hammered with like five people all at once.
9247595	9250217	And I feel bad because some people can't get through, but we'll see.
9250557	9253098	Well, DDR Angel, I know you didn't have a whole lot.
9253118	9254979	You just want to kind of say hi, but you know...
9255319	9263288	For those that are new to OLR, believe it or not, we're still here, as you can hear, and we have a lot of people that we've picked up since the podcasting era.
9263668	9268994	When we switched to podcasting, we gained a whole lot of new listeners because you didn't have to be here live Sunday every week to listen.
9269295	9275542	But since I know you've been listening to tonight's show, what's kind of different about OLR than the way it used to be?
9276907	9281389	Um, well, to me, there's a lot of old stuff that's still there.
9281489	9283430	So, you know, the main part of the show is still there.
9283890	9286512	And I didn't see too much of a difference.
9286552	9290314	But I mean, you guys do have, you know, a lot of other segments and stuff that you add in.
9290374	9294455	So it's just old LR are still being there.
9294596	9297637	But, you know, you've got your new segments, too, which I like.
9297717	9299338	So it's all good.
9299378	9300018	I mean, I don't know.
9300658	9300999	Awesome.
9301439	9305761	Well, anything anything else about the olden OLR days you want to enlighten these new kids with?
9307413	9308513	Um, cake pie.
9308613	9310054	No, wait, you guys already did that.
9310074	9313735	We were joking about all that old stuff earlier.
9314075	9314355	Yeah.
9314855	9320637	So now for those for those that are kind of catching up on lost time, you know, you you used to come to the show as a guest quite often.
9321537	9325959	Now you you I remember you used to play a game called here.
9326199	9326899	Was that what it was called?
9327995	9328555	Oh, there.
9328715	9328995	There.
9329035	9329315	Yeah.
9329775	9330276	Close.
9330756	9331796	Are you still... Close, very close.
9331876	9332576	Are you still involved?
9332596	9332956	They shut down.
9333316	9334497	Yeah, they had to shut down, right.
9334517	9334997	I remember that.
9335917	9339338	So sadly you're not... But you were with them right up until the very end, right?
9339698	9339878	Yes.
9340418	9340798	Awesome.
9341238	9342018	Gotcha, gotcha.
9342979	9346339	And I believe you got married since the last time you were here?
9346379	9347780	Yeah, I did, actually.
9349840	9356562	Somebody from the Belwani community a long time ago that used to come into the chat room by the name of...
9357990	9360393	Ohio BRP Balani or whatever.
9360413	9360954	Yeah.
9362215	9364057	I don't remember his name actually.
9364117	9364738	Big Red Pimp?
9365219	9366180	Yes, Big Red Pimp.
9366861	9367461	There you go.

9370365	9370525	Yep.
9370765	9371746	Congratulations.
9372287	9372607	Thank you.
9372727	9373729	Are you still here in California?
9373769	9374870	You moved out to Ohio, didn't you?
9375491	9375991	No, I didn't.
9376091	9377033	No, I'm still in California.
9377053	9377713	No, he moved here.
9378470	9380311	I'm in Sonoma County, actually.
9380411	9381652	Oh, you're still there.
9381672	9382472	Yeah, I'm still here.
9382532	9385254	You can come by anytime, guys.
9386134	9386795	I might have to.
9386915	9387575	That's awesome.
9387996	9389877	I thought for some reason you went to Ohio for a bit.
9390597	9391317	Oh, no, no, no, no.
9391357	9392178	He's just from here.
9392298	9392878	He moved here.
9393159	9393659	Oh, okay.
9393799	9394079	Got it.
9394619	9396280	See, I'm a little bit behind on the times, too.
9396500	9397241	No, it's all good.
9397481	9398542	All right, but you have a blog.
9398742	9399582	I know you have a blog.
9399962	9402124	I do, but it has nothing to do with gaming.
9402284	9402844	That's all right.
9402884	9405946	Why don't you go ahead and pimp your blog, and I'll try to get one more call.

9463425	9463965	You know what?
9464705	9465206	What the hell?
9465346	9466026	One more call.
9466146	9466586	Why not?
9466686	9468167	We had a short news segment tonight.
9468207	9469047	We'll open up one more time.
9469067	9471688	Just because our phones were getting slammed there a minute ago.
9471728	9474308	So we'll open it up one more time for you guys.
9474328	9477449	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9477509	9479410	The phone lines are open.
9479970	9486012	But of course this means while I wait for the little delay there, I have to think of another banter topic with Dark Sakura.
9488194	9490476	I'm nearly... I'm excited, Rob.
9490917	9491237	How so?
9491297	9491958	With your project?
9492018	9492358	Yeah.
9493239	9494460	Thank you for making this possible.
9494600	9495321	You're welcome.
9496862	9499004	Well, I was just collecting dust at your place anyway.
9499224	9499704	Yeah, it's true.
9499764	9500445	No, the old laptop.
9500645	9503688	You know, it's amazing the stuff I'm finding while I'm going through and unpacking things.
9503768	9506350	I found an old picture of you... Of me.
9506490	9512475	...and Melody taping an episode of Under Sedation Live in Travis's old backyard.
9513336	9513436	Oh...
9516801	9518202	An old, old picture.
9518302	9521344	Yeah, it was you, me, and Melody all huddled together looking cute.
9521424	9522245	I remember this, too.
9522365	9525447	Travis did a backyard episode of Understation Live.
9525467	9526628	I don't remember what the shtick was.
9526648	9527708	You'll have to bring it over.
9527808	9529409	There's always some shtick with Travis.
9529450	9531591	I love him, but there's always some shtick.
9531891	9534153	And this was the backyard episode shtick.
9535053	9535714	Oh, yeah, I found that.
9536034	9538135	I found one of all of us on a DDR machine.
9538496	9543719	It was me, you, Irene, the guy Irene was dating at the time.
9544540	9545820	So she probably don't want to see that picture.
9547342	9547962	Who else was in it?
9548002	9549403	I think one other person was all in the picture.
9549664	9550284	Maybe Brad?
9552146	9552806	Oh, Bradley?
9553087	9553267	No.
9553327	9553767	Not Bradley.
9553927	9554948	Brad.
9555368	9558011	Yeah, I think he's in it, hence the crazy person that I read.
9558411	9559712	Yeah, I don't know.
9560073	9560373	I don't know.
9560433	9561234	I remember what else.
9562014	9563115	Somebody else, I think, was in that picture.
9563235	9564757	He was our mighty Mormon Power Ranger.
9567599	9567959	Let's see.
9568059	9570041	What else did I find when I was moving?
9570261	9572243	Let me know if you find the install disks.
9572944	9573304	For what?
9573364	9574405	The laptop?
9574425	9574505	Yeah.
9575583	9576484	I doubt I'll find that.
9577885	9578685	You know I'm being silly.
9579606	9579846	I know.
9581107	9582027	I want to see the old pictures.
9582808	9585610	I will find those pictures and I will get them to you.
9585670	9587031	Alright, finally the calls are coming in.
9587051	9587691	The delay caught up.
9588031	9588932	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9588952	9589292	Who's this?
9590393	9591073	I made it in.
9591213	9595756	Wow, you guys are like trying to call Britney Spears on a Friday night or something.
9595816	9596577	It's great.
9596597	9597457	It feels special.
9598198	9602701	This is Derek H. Derek from Virginia Beach, Virginia.
9603137	9604218	Derek, how are you?
9604238	9606299	Of course I recognize your voice the minute I picked up.
9606359	9607180	How are you, my friend?
9607900	9610122	Eh, you know, this and that.
9610502	9617047	The important thing is, the Commodore 64, I had one, I loved it.
9617327	9624192	I started with a VIC-20, went all the way up to an Amiga 1200, 030-6060, for those in the know.
9625032	9625693	I'm sorry, 030-4040.
9625873	9630196	You stuck with Commodore for a very long time, because the Amigas were like the last big hurrahs for them.
9630977	9632638	Yeah, that was sad, because...
9633433	9640289	If you had an Amiga, you were the type of person that believed, and I mean, you believed that one day...
9641235	9652224	Everybody else would wake up and everybody would be using Amigas and you would be vindicated for all your years of... Yeah, that never happened.
9652324	9657207	Amigas were kind of the Macs of their time, which is ironic because Macs were out at the same time.
9657267	9660990	But you know how people pay the premiums for the Apple products these days?
9661511	9663852	Amiga was kind of like that back in the day, in a way.
9665153	9666655	You know what has happened to Mac?
9666735	9669477	That's what Amiga people thought were going to happen for Amiga.
9669877	9670317	And it's just...
9671438	9673040	Oh, it had it all.
9673440	9676283	If only they had cellular phones when Commodore was big.
9676403	9678745	Maybe, maybe they could have been the ones to think of at first.
9679366	9680527	That Amiga was so great.
9680627	9682849	But the Converse before, I guess, is what we're talking about.
9682889	9685492	But the Amiga was kick-ass.
9686433	9688354	You say you were thinking about going to get one?
9688374	9689135	Mm-hmm.
9689696	9690356	Yeah, don't do that.
9690657	9690957	Why?
9691097	9692578	Are they all in terrible shape?
9693299	9694760	Stick with the emulation because...
9695901	9701145	Once you get one, it's like all of a sudden everything rushes back to you.
9701485	9708971	Except it rushes back to you in present day because computers now are literally 2,000 to 3,000 times faster than the Converse 64.
9710112	9711413	That's not even an exaggeration.
9712418	9712939	DarkSakura,
9727598	9750334	and it's uh games they don't play like you think they're gonna play right but they don't because back then the lag was you expected the lag you expected things not when you move the joystick you expected a half second or second thing before something moved on the screen nowadays if that happens you're like what the what the hell is wrong with this thing what's wrong and
9751094	9754676	And then you'll fall out of love with the Comma Murderer.
9754696	9756597	Remember the Comma Murderer 64 as it is.
9756977	9758338	As it was, not as it is.
9758478	9760039	This happens a lot in gaming.
9760259	9763141	You know, things are better through those retro-colored glasses.
9763201	9764481	Or, you know, they say the rose-colored glasses.
9764501	9768804	But the retro-colored glasses, sometimes I think we remember gaming better that way.
9768904	9770625	And I just mentioned this earlier in the show.
9770685	9772606	The X-Men arcade game that's on Xbox Live.
9773386	9774386	Elite Elite Elite is...
9801448	9802589	and insanely good.
9803209	9812534	And for what they stuck on that 64K and that floppy disk, which I think held, what, 100, like 150K or something, some stupid low number.
9812554	9823759	It had more worlds on Elite than Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, all of the Wing Commanders combined.
9823900	9830363	You got Jamie's husband, Dan, up from the couch to come in here to say and agree with you that Elite was awesome, just so you know.
9831543	9833004	All the stuff that people say you can do.
9833584	9834505	It's an open world.
9834805	9837367	If you want to do this, if you want to be a rogue, be a rogue.
9837447	9842149	Elite had that, except it was 25 years ago on a Commodore 64.
9842189	9848513	You can literally say, I'm going to spend the rest of my life just moving corn back and forth between these two planets.
9849033	9854296	Or I'm just going to be a policeman and hang out and just kill bad guys as they try to run.
9854737	9858239	Or you can be anything in that game before...
9859246	9869870	Thousands of years before Grand Theft Auto 4 came around or Star Wars, Galaxies, old school of the Jedi's thing.
9870710	9873711	You know, I think the Mass Effect comparison is a pretty good one with Elite.
9873831	9876372	I mean, because it was like a spacey, space game, right?
9876973	9879053	Yeah, you could pick your own ship.
9879473	9880694	You could outfit your ship.
9880714	9882515	They had shrivels in it.
9882955	9883175	It was...
9884727	9889228	I want to play the game, but I can't play it because it's on the friggin' Commodore 64 and it's gonna suck if I play it now.
9890809	9892329	You have to remember it how it was, Derek.
9892669	9894290	You have to remember it how it was.
9894350	9899371	The original SimCity was on the Commodore 64, and of course that game's blown up a million times over.
9899692	9901052	What were some other great Commodore 64 games?
9901092	9903533	I remember Spy vs. Spy was one of my favorites.
9904893	9907074	Little Computer People is The Sims.
9926445	9936058	of course, Video Games Computer Entertainment had a little thing I would sit there and type it in and here's the sad part I did not get a
9937157	9963515	for you for once again for people I did not get a break of 1541 for for like a year because we were poor and I still think my mom's I now I don't know how she got me that commerce before because we were poor and she got me one so I thank her every day for getting me started on this but it took me it took her a while before I got to 1541 so I would sit there and type those programs in and tell everybody not to come near my computer and I'll put a pillow over
9963955	9969319	over top of it and hide it so nobody would turn it off because once you turn it off, it's gone.
9969339	9972202	There's no flash RAM saving stuff.
9972222	9973943	You didn't have a drive to save on?
9975825	9976185	Save.
9976365	9980708	And plus, when I first got it, I typed load and load didn't work.
9980728	9982390	You had to type load, comma, eight, comma, one.
9982450	9982610	Yep.
9983317	9983637	DarkSakura.com
10003958	10008679	Yeah, it taught me not to believe in miracles.
10010240	10012700	Speaking of believing in miracles, I have to ask this.
10012800	10017301	Obviously, a lot of people on the All Games Network know you from your show, Dead Pixel Live.
10017681	10025343	I know you're on a little bit of a siesta right now, enjoying your Mai Tais on the beach while you're taking a break from Dead Pixel Live.
10025423	10029064	But any chance of a re-revival?
10031419	10034440	All I can say now is that Dead Pigs Alive is currently on hiatus.
10035481	10043185	I have found out, as you guys may or may not know, I'm sure you do know, this thing kind of fills a hole in your life.
10043946	10052430	And without it, all of a sudden you realize, I miss a lot of... I kind of want to do my show again, but I guess maybe I should get out more.
10052630	10053731	But I really want to do my show.
10054632	10056793	It's good that it was there.
10059959	10065402	I really don't know what I'd do with my Sunday nights without OLR.
10065422	10067984	I'd probably be watching Desperate Housewives, and that's just sad.
10068144	10069185	I know what I would do.
10069505	10070706	I would play more Dragon Age 2.
10071766	10076009	For now, but... Then you'd be like, I want to tell somebody about Dragon Age 2.
10077610	10079431	I remember when I had a show and it was a lot of fun.
10079451	10081272	Actually, I'd probably just do another show.
10083933	10084593	Listen to how she is.
10084833	10086174	I would just do a show without you guys.
10087995	10088315	No.
10088515	10089195	I see how it is.
10089275	10091656	I couldn't do it without you guys.
10092076	10092817	Maybe with Tiara.
10094825	10096868	Derek, best of luck in whatever it is you do.
10097048	10099491	Thanks so much for the call and taking a trip down memory lane with us.
10100473	10101714	Hey, Amiga forever.
10101894	10102435	That's right.
10102495	10105379	Take care, buddy.
10105419	10106640	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10106660	10107401	Those were some good calls.
10107641	10109524	See, it was worth waiting for.
10111090	10112311	Designing a free running course is hard
10139645	10141968	My final thought is I still have kitchenware to pack.
10142429	10142710	Joy.
10143611	10144793	DarkSakura, your final thought?
10145173	10146996	I wonder what my hair was like in that picture.
10149110	10149590	Was it long?
10149910	10150390	I think so.
10150490	10154511	Was it when I had long, really kind of crappy, bushy hair that was five different shades of red?
10154671	10154871	Yes.
10155732	10155992	Yeah.
10156272	10156752	Good times.
10156812	10159032	I'm glad I have much better hair these days.
