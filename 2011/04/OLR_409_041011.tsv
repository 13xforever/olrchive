7000	14000	Who's your hosts? Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lotu!
14000	19000	Tonight, April 10th, 2011, has the 3DS sold up to expectations in Japan,
19000	27000	a new Sonic game is revealed, and after many years, a fan Streets of Rage remake is released.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,
36000	41000	the show where every gamer has a voice. We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,
41000	45000	www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
45000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
48000	51000	the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers!
51000	55000	Rob has renewed my faith in computing.
55000	56000	How's that?
56000	59000	By giving me a task of revival.
59000	62000	You're gonna CPR on one of my dead computers, yeah.
62000	68000	Because I've needed, I've been going through this dilemma where I can't get Maya working on my computer,
68000	74000	and I'm gonna put Windows 7 and Dual Boot Linux on it, but in the meantime it's like, I still really want a Mac.
74000	80000	And I have a Mac, it's old, and as far as I know it doesn't work, and I replaced the laptop a long time ago,
80000	84000	I just ended up getting a PC laptop because it was really cheap and I didn't have a lot of money at the time.
84000	89000	So yeah, the PC one's been serving me fine, so if you can revive that Mac one, shit, have fun with it.
89000	93000	The other thought is I'm gonna put Linux on it.
93000	96000	Of course. When in doubt, just install Linux on it.
96000	102000	Hey, also with us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us.
102000	103000	Hello.
103000	104000	And at least he has chicken.
104000	105000	Yes.
105000	107000	How you doing, Loki, how are things for you?
107000	108000	Doing fine.
108000	109000	Yeah?
109000	113000	My hands are sticky so I'm trying to figure out how to hold the microphone without, you know.
113000	115000	Alright, I'll leave you alone so you can finish chicken.
115000	118000	It's just a radio program we do pretty consistently every week here at six o'clock.
118000	120000	You know what? Here's your trivia for the night.
120000	121000	What's that?
121000	126000	Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones album, had a zipper on the thing and also had a guy with a boner on it.
126000	127000	What?
127000	133000	Seriously, the album, it has like a shot of a guy's crotch and it had a zipper on it where you can unzip the jeans.
133000	136000	But the guy had a big boner when they took the picture, so.
136000	138000	How nice that is.
138000	139000	And it was Sticky Fingers.
139000	140000	Right.
140000	142000	So, there's your trivia.
142000	147000	We're going to get into our gaming weeks, but nobody else in the studio tonight, just the three of us here.
147000	150000	You guys, though, are joining us, always the fourth guest with us, our chat room.
150000	155000	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to chat with us live as you tape live on this Sunday night.
155000	158000	Just kind of like a live note or whatever.
158000	161000	We're really delayed or what have you on the feed.
161000	164000	I don't know what's up. It's like two to three minutes behind.
164000	167000	So, when we say something and when you guys see it.
167000	170000	So, you'll have to forgive us a little bit if we're going back to sort.
170000	174000	Because we want to make sure the chat has a chance to get feedback on stories.
174000	176000	We may have to go back a little bit to do that.
176000	180000	I don't know why things are so, well, I do know why things are so delayed, but it's nothing we can really fix, sadly.
180000	183000	So, we're just going to have to deal with it. Yay!
183000	188000	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games you've been playing this week.
188000	190000	Always a nice conversation starter.
190000	192000	Doc Soccer, how was your gaming week?
192000	196000	For the record, I just posted a picture of the album cover with the boner.
196000	197000	So.
197000	198000	Thank you.
198000	199000	I played a little Dragon Age 2.
199000	203000	I am finally into the second act and totally enjoying the game.
203000	208000	I've given up on my lesbian love because Fenris showed up.
208000	209000	I see.
209000	210000	Broody elf dude.
210000	212000	And he's almost like a chick, so that's cool.
212000	214000	He's a very girly man.
214000	216000	He whines a lot, so.
216000	219000	But at least, like, the dwarf makes fun of him for it.
219000	221000	And so they just bite back and forth.
221000	222000	They're so much fun.
222000	227000	Although, although, although I'm still building a little bit of relationship with Meryl, so maybe I'll have them both.
227000	231000	And then I could totally sleep with Isabella anytime I want to because she's a slut.
231000	232000	Um.
232000	234000	Then, um.
234000	236000	I, uh.
236000	241000	We're actually going to be getting back into playing Final Fantasy, Dan and I are, but we did not start yet because he just got back on Wednesday.
241000	242000	And, um.
242000	244000	Playing, um.
244000	246000	World of Warcraft, of course.
246000	256000	And I am almost at exalted with the stupid drunken dwarves and I don't have to do the stupid motion sickness inducing drunken quest again.
256000	258000	Hopefully soon.
258000	260000	You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?
260000	264000	Where you have to, like, drink ten things of ale and then you get all the fuzzy effects and everything.
264000	268000	And I'm like, motion sick, it makes me want to puke every time I do it.
268000	272000	Yeah, it's, it's pretty, you gotta be careful with that because it even messes me up.
272000	275000	I still refuse to do the beer run, for the record, because it's fucking annoying.
275000	280000	But I finally got exalted with kitty people and have badass shoes.
280000	281000	And a camel.
281000	282000	Oh my god shoes.
282000	284000	Oh my god shoes.
284000	287000	And then I got Rebecca Black to twenty.
287000	289000	Yes, you actually have a character named Rebecca Black.
289000	291000	Did you roll her on a Friday?
291000	292000	Yes I did.
292000	293000	Yes I did.
293000	295000	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
295000	299000	She's actually, it turns out, because I made her a human paladin as a joke.
299000	302000	And it turns out I really like a human paladin.
302000	304000	So I've kept the character.
304000	306000	So, who knew?
306000	311000	And then I always get, you know, people lull when I go into town, so it's funny.
311000	313000	Done.
313000	316000	Alright, Loki, if you're done with your chicken, tell us about your gaming week.
316000	319000	Um, I'm gonna play a whole lot.
319000	322000	Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, as usual.
322000	326000	Um, other than Grand Theft Auto, I played a little bit of Game Dev Story.
326000	328000	Just very briefly.
328000	329000	Little bit of Rerave.
329000	334000	Um, download the new song packs just for the hell of it.
334000	336000	And that was kind of fun.
336000	345000	And then, um, actually some excitebots last night, until the Wii broke.
345000	347000	But it was fun, unless...
347000	348000	It'll be fixed soon.
348000	353000	Yeah, you were telling me when you came in here, like, well I broke my Wii last night, and I said, well the good news is it's just a Wii.
353000	357000	Yeah, it's true, and we haven't played that in a long time.
357000	360000	It's kind of sad though, because I was looking forward to, like, playing some more stuff on there.
360000	364000	But, um, it'll be fixed soon. It's not a big deal.
364000	366000	It's just inconvenient right now.
366000	368000	That I have to lose my progress.
368000	369000	This is only a flesh wound.
369000	374000	Well, we've been so much out of excitebots for the longest time.
374000	381000	I mean, it's kind of a learning curve to get back in and remember, like, how to be so kickass at it.
381000	384000	But, it's still fun.
384000	390000	So there's a question for Dark Soccer in our chat room from, and I know this person has this name just to get me to read it.
390000	393000	But it's from iFarTed.
393000	395000	It says, StarSakura question in our chat room.
395000	401000	At chat.orangestonesmedia.com, would you recommend Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 to someone that's moderately into MMOs?
401000	405000	Well, my answer was, I like DA too. I haven't played DAO, honestly.
405000	412000	Um, I, it doesn't really have a feel of an MMO. It just has a feel of a fun kind of adventure game.
412000	416000	So, I've recommended anybody. It's pretty fun.
416000	425000	I mean, if the type of running around and picking up clues and doing quests in different parts of towns is not your cup of tea, then go get your coffee elsewhere.
425000	438000	And MMOs are so diverse too. Like, it's really hard to say, you know, people that are into WoW may not necessarily be into, I don't know, DC Universe online.
438000	442000	You know, and the people into that might not be into the same, you know, MMOs are a pretty vast market now.
442000	449000	Well, every time I start to get just a little bit bored with Dragon Age 2, one of the characters will say something so hilarious that I keep laughing.
449000	457000	And then I found, um, the, uh, uh, experience cheat. Well, it's more like a glitch in the game where you can get an experience in gold.
457000	460000	Which really helped. So now I really like the game.
460000	461000	There you go.
461000	464000	Well, I didn't find it. Tiara told me about it, but then I did it by accident.
464000	469000	Because I wasn't really gonna do it, except I managed to get in the right spot, so I was like, maybe I will!
469000	472000	Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop A button.
472000	478000	Um, we also have a blast from the past in our chat room tonight. Check this out, DDR Angel's in chat.
478000	482000	I don't think I've seen her in chat since like episode 130? Maybe? No, it's probably later than that, but still.
482000	488000	Uh, so DDR Angel's in chat saying, you can turn the drunk effect off. I actually never knew that. I don't doubt that that's not true.
488000	490000	You can set down your graphic settings to do it.
490000	491000	You, yeah.
491000	492000	I think.
492000	493000	There's probably a way you can just go in and turn it off.
493000	494000	I'm lazy, and honestly...
494000	498000	I never knew either. I just always thought the way to not get the effects to do that, don't drink.
498000	499000	It's just like real life.
499000	503000	Well, yeah, but you have to drink till you finish the class. You have to drink ten things of ale.
503000	505000	Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.
505000	508000	But you know what? I'll tell you how long it takes me to do the Warhammer crap now.
508000	515000	Wildhammer. No, I was talking about Warhammer because my friend Gary and I were talking and we were talking about how annoying Warhammer is.
515000	517000	I hate Warhammer. Anyway.
517000	523000	Um, Wildhammer. I can do it in like ten minutes now. It's like super fast and easy.
523000	524000	Oh, all the dailies?
524000	525000	Yeah.
525000	526000	Yeah.
526000	529000	It's like a beer run. Because I hate that one. So I just refuse to do it.
529000	531000	I hate the Wildhammer quest. But that's a talk for another show.
531000	532000	Yes.
532000	537000	All right. Sorry, Loki. I don't think you were quite done with your gaming week because I see you've opened up this little...
537000	540000	You've opened up your package that you brought with you.
540000	548000	Of course. No, this week as kind of a random thing, we had guests. Celebrity guests at my work.
548000	556000	So out of, I don't know, just trying to be funny, I guess, I had them sign my 360.
556000	559000	So I have my JTAG 360, by the way.
559000	566000	I have it signed by Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher...
566000	570000	What was it? I'm trying to remember his last name now.
570000	572000	That was the lowest build of the three.
572000	573000	Yeah.
573000	577000	But yeah, it's pretty awesome.
577000	578000	Oh, Christopher Thornton.
578000	581000	It's going up on the OLR thing now.
581000	585000	Yeah, somebody posted the video. We had a little video stumble on our site.
585000	592000	I think somebody found the, one of our authors found the video that you posted on YouTube where you're like, hi.
592000	599000	Well, we have guests here today and I didn't have anything for them to sign. So I brought my Xbox 360.
599000	600000	I could have used it.
600000	601000	See if they actually sign it.
601000	603000	But why do that? That's not as cool.
603000	604000	And by the way...
604000	607000	My favorite is what the guy says. Hold on. I'm just walking up.
607000	608000	I feel embarrassed.
608000	609000	It's a hard drive.
609000	610000	Oh, an Xbox 360.
610000	612000	I don't have anything to sign other than this, so...
612000	613000	That's cool.
613000	614000	Let's do it, dude.
614000	615000	I've never signed an Xbox.
615000	616000	Awesome.
616000	618000	That's Orlando Bloom, by the way, that doesn't know what the thing is.
618000	620000	I've never signed an Xbox.
620000	621000	Yeah.
621000	622000	Who to?
622000	623000	Uh, Matt.
623000	624000	Matt?
624000	625000	Yeah.
625000	627000	Matt, play hard.
627000	630000	That's what he signed it as. Matt, play hard.
630000	631000	Yeah, that's good.
631000	633000	That's awesome.
633000	634000	Thank you, Matt.
634000	636000	It's poorly filmed because I had to hold the Xbox in.
636000	638000	Wait, wait. My favorite is the part coming out.
638000	639000	Nice.
639000	640000	Is that the one with the blue light?
640000	641000	Is that the one with the blue light?
641000	643000	No, just DVDs.
643000	644000	I don't know.
644000	645000	HD DVDs?
645000	647000	Do you think that'll play out?
647000	648000	I don't know what it was.
648000	650000	Aww, actors are real people, too. They don't know what they're...
650000	653000	It's cool. He's busy. I mean, he doesn't have time to play games.
653000	657000	Well, if you like, I have spray fixative.
657000	659000	So it won't come off.
659000	661000	I don't think it's gonna come off anyways.
661000	664000	Well, I've had stuff come off of plastic before, so...
664000	665000	Wait, but this way.
665000	666000	Well, don't wash it. You'll be fine.
666000	667000	I'm not gonna wash it.
667000	671000	No, I have a ton of signed posters and stuff by different celebrities coming in.
671000	674000	Not big celebrities. A couple.
674000	676000	We've had, like, um...
676000	679000	I'm trying to think of some of the people we had.
679000	681000	Uh...
681000	683000	Yeah, none of them are really big celebrities.
683000	688000	But my posters are sitting under a sack of magazines at my desk.
688000	692000	And this goes with me to and from work all the time.
692000	694000	All the more reason to have some fixative.
694000	695000	That is a higher honor for them, yeah.
695000	697000	All the more reason to have some fixative.
697000	701000	Um, I'm moving this week. It's something big I'm doing right now, obviously.
701000	704000	And I found some of my autographed pictures.
704000	708000	And one of the autographed pictures I found the other day was the autographed picture of Scott Wolf.
708000	710000	From Party of Five that you got me.
710000	712000	That's right. I remember that now.
712000	714000	Ah, Scott Wolf. He is a tiny...
714000	715000	Now he's on V.
715000	717000	He is so tiny.
717000	719000	No, but, um...
719000	720000	But so dreamy.
720000	721000	No, they were actually really cool.
721000	724000	Because, you know, most of the celebrity guests we have, you know, don't really...
724000	727000	They kind of just make their appearance and go.
727000	730000	They're just, like, all chilling in the audience with different people.
730000	735000	Um, and just, you know, chatting up people and talking about movies and that kind of stuff.
735000	737000	So, it was really cool.
737000	743000	It was for a movie called, uh, Sympathy for Delicious, I think is what it was.
743000	744000	Or something like that.
744000	745000	Sounds yummy.
745000	747000	It... It's... It's kind of cool.
747000	749000	Um...
749000	751000	So...
751000	753000	Yeah, it was... I don't know. It was just kind of funny.
753000	758000	So this must be worth three million dollars if the Sarah Palin one's worth one million dollars.
758000	760000	There was a Sarah Palin Xbox worth a million dollars?
760000	762000	Well, it's not worth a million dollars.
762000	764000	It's put up on eBay for a million dollars.
764000	765000	I see.
765000	766000	No one's gonna buy it.
766000	767000	But you're not gonna put this on eBay.
767000	768000	I'm not gonna put it on eBay.
768000	769000	You're gonna treasure this forever.
769000	770000	Yes.
770000	771000	What did the wife say?
771000	772000	She thought it was funny.
772000	774000	She's like, nerd!
774000	776000	Nerd!
776000	778000	Alright, anything else for your gaming week?
778000	779000	That's it.
779000	780000	Besides random celebrities signing your Xbox?
780000	781000	Actually, you know what my coolest autographs are?
781000	782000	Huh?
782000	784000	I have three autographed Wil Wheaton books.
784000	785000	Mm-hmm.
785000	789000	And I have, um, an autographed Jonathan Coulton CD.
789000	791000	And then I have my Facebook-style photo with him.
791000	792000	Mm-hmm.
792000	793000	That he thought was hilarious.
793000	797000	I think my most treasured autograph is my Paula Abdul autograph.
797000	799000	From the Under My Spell Tour.
799000	800000	Oh, wow.
800000	803000	This is way before she was crazy on pills on American Idol.
803000	804000	Actually, I take that back.
804000	809000	My greatest, like, legitimate autograph is, um, Yoko Kanno.
809000	810000	Oh.
810000	814000	Who did Macross Plus and, uh, Escaflowne and all that.
814000	815000	Mm-hmm.
815000	818000	Um, we've got her, uh, signing one of our Macross Plus CDs.
818000	820000	Well, I'm gonna keep having people sign it.
820000	821000	To dance on.
821000	824000	Are you gonna get more celebrities to sign it?
824000	827000	Well, I was intending, I was hoping that they'd sign smaller, but they took up the whole
827000	828000	side of three people.
828000	831000	I was gonna say, you should've told Orlando Bloom to write a little fuckin' smaller.
831000	832000	Like, he took up half the...
832000	835000	That's like that dick that signed the entire page in my yearbook.
835000	836000	True story.
836000	837000	This one little jackass.
837000	840000	Kids are such assholes.
840000	841000	Especially the ones in high school.
841000	844000	This high school jackass signed in my yearbook.
844000	846000	It took up the entire page.
846000	847000	To Rob.
847000	851000	If you wanna get laid, climb up a chicken's ass and wait.
851000	853000	Love, asshole.
853000	854000	But his real name.
854000	856000	And it took up the entire page.
856000	858000	What an ass.
858000	861000	You should scan that in and post it on his Facebook.
861000	863000	I don't like I talk to the guy.
863000	864000	Fuck him.
864000	865000	Deceasing.
865000	866000	Anyway.
866000	867000	Anyways.
867000	868000	It's cool.
868000	869000	I dig it.
869000	870000	So.
870000	871000	Alright.
871000	876000	I have to give a public thank you, by the way, to the lovely Marissa for the gift she
876000	880000	sent me of amber oil perfume from Solstice Scents.
880000	883000	Very nice of her.
883000	884000	It smells pretty.
884000	886000	It smells like amber.
886000	887000	Alright.
887000	888000	My gaming week.
888000	889000	I gotta be honest.
889000	892000	I've been moving, so I haven't had a lot in my gaming week, and I hate coming on here
892000	895000	on the show and saying, yeah, I have a video game podcast, so I haven't really been playing
895000	896000	any video games.
896000	898000	But I think I have a pretty legitimate excuse.
898000	904000	I watched Alan play the Mortal Kombat demo, and, you know, nothing new there, although,
904000	909000	you know, I keep laughing at the horrible, horrible Molina fatality, because it's funny.
909000	913000	And then he was playing some other game, too, and you know this game, Dark Soccer, the minute
913000	916000	I say it, it's the Strider dude did this on PlayStation 3.
916000	917000	Moon Diver.
917000	918000	Moon Diver.
918000	919000	I've got it.
919000	920000	I watched him play that.
920000	921000	Super cool.
921000	922000	And I was, it's so funny, because he fired it up.
922000	923000	I didn't know what it was.
923000	924000	He's like, oh, it's Moon Diver.
924000	926000	And I'm like, this fucking looks like Strider.
926000	930000	And then I thought, I'm like, oh, this must be the game that Jamie was telling me about
930000	932000	that it's by the guy who did Strider.
932000	934000	Yeah, it's on PlayStation Network for like 15 bucks.
934000	935000	Yeah.
935000	937000	It's kind of one of those things, I bet a lot of people don't know it's out there, but
937000	940000	if you like Strider, to be fair, I didn't play it.
940000	944000	I just watched Alan play it, because literally, that was about all the gaming I did this week.
944000	946000	But I was like, wow, this looks just like Strider.
946000	947000	I should check this out.
947000	949000	But it's four players simultaneous.
949000	950000	Yes.
950000	952000	So I would love to do a full four player game on that.
952000	954000	I bet it's a lot of fun.
954000	956000	Lots of little sword.
956000	960000	But the thing I don't get is like in every one of his games in Japanese versions, you
960000	964000	get ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha every time the guy slashes his sword.
964000	967000	So I'm like, they took that out for the American Strider.
967000	968000	Oh, that's good.
968000	972000	Because he'd just go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha the whole time.
972000	973000	But anyway.
973000	977000	Alright, going to our chat room with some comments on our gaming weeks.
977000	978000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
978000	982000	Bobby Blackwolf wants to know, how many autographs has OLR signed for others?
982000	984000	That's a good question.
984000	985000	One or two.
985000	993000	We had one of the in the groove discs that we gave away that remember we fucked up the
993000	994000	cover of it.
994000	997000	The turbo graphics, I think there was something we signed, right?
997000	998000	Yeah.
998000	1004000	Oh, we sent the turbo graphics to the winner and we all signed it in silver paint pen.
1004000	1009000	And there was, I think we sent like a thank you note or something to somebody who did
1009000	1011000	something for us and we included the ferret.
1011000	1012000	I remember that.
1012000	1015000	I got, I got pulled aside at Fonomy.
1015000	1017000	Remember the last time I went?
1017000	1020000	To sign somebody's like costume prop.
1020000	1021000	Like, okay.
1021000	1023000	I might have signed one thing at PAX East.
1023000	1026000	You didn't give away the orange bat or something like that.
1026000	1027000	No.
1027000	1031000	We had, we did a new orange bat and gave that away.
1031000	1032000	Yes.
1032000	1034000	Because the original orange bat's in the closet behind you.
1034000	1035000	It's in the closet.
1035000	1036000	Yeah.
1036000	1039000	I don't have delusions that were like actually famous or whatever, but once in a while.
1039000	1040000	I do.
1040000	1041000	I'm delusional enough for all of us.
1041000	1044000	A random listener I just run into in an event.
1044000	1045000	Of course.
1045000	1046000	I have another autograph.
1046000	1050000	I have an autograph screener from Rob Schneider, which is kind of odd.
1050000	1052000	He is, he is also very short.
1052000	1055000	A lot of actors, very short.
1055000	1057000	None of those people, not short.
1057000	1060000	God, I can't remember any actors' names today.
1060000	1061000	What the hell is wrong with me?
1061000	1062000	What was he in?
1062000	1063000	What'd he do?
1063000	1064000	Jurassic Park.
1064000	1068000	He's now in Law and Order, Criminal Intent.
1068000	1072000	Earth Girls Are Easy.
1072000	1076000	Blank, blank, blank.
1076000	1077000	Independence Day.
1077000	1078000	Blank.
1078000	1081000	Was it the dude that played the old guy?
1081000	1083000	No, not the old guy.
1083000	1087000	He was the smart guy who figured out the pattern.
1087000	1088000	Oh.
1088000	1089000	Oh, I know.
1089000	1090000	Jeff Goldblum?
1090000	1091000	Yes, Jeff Goldblum.
1091000	1096000	I had Jeff Goldblum's autograph, and I such, I missed out on such an opportunity.
1096000	1102000	I actually had from some random lots of records I bought, the soundtrack of Earth Girls Are
1102000	1104000	Easy on vinyl.
1104000	1105000	I could have had him sign it.
1105000	1106000	I was like, ugh.
1106000	1109000	That would have been hilarious.
1109000	1111000	He probably would have laughed.
1111000	1114000	He probably would have thought that was really funny.
1114000	1116000	I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.
1116000	1122000	We've had the son of the guy from on Three's Company.
1122000	1123000	John Ritter's son?
1123000	1125000	Yeah, Jason Ritter.
1125000	1126000	He came out.
1126000	1130000	He was pretty cool.
1130000	1131000	Just a lot of people.
1131000	1133000	That guy from Fargo.
1133000	1137000	Now, when I worked at GNC, I met a lot of famous people, like the remaining members
1137000	1140000	of Sublime, and a bunch of wrestlers.
1140000	1142000	Well, we're going to get into video game chat, right?
1142000	1143000	Yeah.
1143000	1144000	Hollywood chat.
1144000	1148000	Gene Siskel out before he had his whole cancer thing.
1148000	1152000	Just a couple quick comments from chat, because again, they're behind a little bit.
1152000	1155000	TigerKlaas says, Loki, you better cherish that 360 for as long as you can, because soon
1155000	1159000	you will see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the Hulk in the Avengers movie.
1159000	1160000	That's right, I forgot about that.
1160000	1162000	Oh, awesome.
1162000	1164000	He's going to be big time soon.
1164000	1173000	I mean, he directed this movie, the movie that he came in to promote, and it was him
1173000	1180000	and the Christopher Thornton, because they were kind of roommates and stuff, and Christopher
1180000	1186000	Thornton, he got in an accident, like a climbing accident, where he became paralyzed, and this
1186000	1190000	was kind of all about him and learning to deal with that.
1190000	1196000	And the movie's about him realizing he has the gift of healing, kind of like one of those
1196000	1201000	spiritual healers or something like that, and what he ends up doing with it, and it's
1201000	1203000	kind of interesting.
1203000	1206000	More comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1206000	1211000	Who was saying about the DSI was Defective Candy said, my greatest autograph is my DSI
1211000	1213000	signed by Nobuo Uematsu.
1213000	1214000	That's a pretty good one, too.
1214000	1218000	Oh, I know who else I have that actually made me super giddy to get.
1218000	1219000	Koji Kondo.
1219000	1220000	Ah, there you go.
1220000	1222000	When he was doing the Wii Orchestra thing.
1222000	1226000	And sj100matt says, I signed a shoe for Electric Sisterhood at PAX East.
1226000	1227000	See, I don't even remember that.
1227000	1228000	I was drunk.
1228000	1231000	That's what I always say when I don't remember something that probably happened.
1231000	1232000	I was drunk.
1232000	1235000	Hey, I remember where one of the other ferrets went.
1235000	1237000	I actually found one when I was moving.
1237000	1238000	You did?
1238000	1239000	You didn't bring it?
1239000	1240000	No.
1240000	1241000	I'll bring it.
1241000	1244000	Remember when one of the other ferrets got attached to the Katamari ball?
1244000	1245000	That's right.
1245000	1246000	At E3 one year.
1246000	1249000	Alright, enough reminiscing, enough Hollywood chat.
1249000	1251000	Let's get into a little bit of housekeeping.
1251000	1252000	No show next week.
1252000	1253000	We will not be here live next week.
1253000	1254000	I gotta watch the kitty.
1254000	1257000	Loki and myself have some other things we have to take care of.
1257000	1259000	Dark Sakura would be a one-woman show otherwise.
1259000	1261000	And I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to that.
1261000	1263000	Oh, I could totally go live.
1263000	1267000	It's gonna be called Bitches Listen.
1267000	1268000	That's what my new show's gonna be called.
1268000	1271000	Wouldn't it be Listen to Bitches?
1271000	1272000	Hee hee.
1272000	1275000	Rob, you see what our listeners can't see?
1275000	1276000	Heart!
1276000	1278000	Only half of one.
1278000	1281000	So yeah, we won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.
1281000	1283000	So bear with us.
1283000	1284000	Yep, that's really it.
1284000	1289000	Otherwise, visit our website at orangelaunchradio.com, our Facebook at facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio,
1289000	1291000	twitter.com slash orangelaunchradio.
1291000	1292000	We're on all those sites.
1292000	1293000	All the social networking stuff.
1293000	1295000	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1295000	1298000	I don't know, it felt like after last week, this is kind of a slow news week, but there's
1298000	1300000	been some things worth mentioning.
1300000	1302000	A few things.
1302000	1309000	So, of course, it's coming out now, reports of just how well the 3DS sold in different
1309000	1316000	regions, and it says, you know, Nintendo said 1.5 million of the 4 million shipped handhelds
1316000	1320000	were headed for Japan by the end of March.
1320000	1326000	And I guess, according to the Japanese sales tracker, kind of like the MPD group over here,
1326000	1329000	Mediacrate, there are still plenty of leftovers.
1329000	1335000	They're saying that they've only sold about 836,000 units, meaning that they're still
1335000	1344000	unbroken the 1 million mark in Japan, and still have about 664,000 units left.
1344000	1353000	Yeah, I know from purchasing my Japanese system originally, yeah, it was pretty easy to get.
1353000	1356000	It was not, there were not shortages on this stuff.
1356000	1364000	Now, I don't know, for me, I think under a million units at launch is kind of, for
1364000	1365000	Nintendo, isn't good.
1365000	1370000	I mean, it's, you would kind of expect them to sell well with their handhelds, because
1370000	1373000	I mean, they have a pretty good market share over there, and people are kind of gung-ho
1373000	1378000	about that stuff, but I really think what hurt them was the lack of, you know, must
1378000	1380000	have titles at launch.
1380000	1385000	Well, could it also be, I don't know, the earthquake and the tsunamis making people
1385000	1389000	think of other things over there than, you know, just 3D stuff?
1389000	1393000	Yeah, okay, but the earthquake stuff happened, what, a couple weeks ago?
1393000	1394000	Is that right?
1394000	1398000	Yeah, I mean, okay, I get it, but, you know, there might have been some people that were
1398000	1400000	waiting a little bit, I don't know.
1400000	1401000	Uh, no.
1401000	1404000	You can't deny that cut into sales, potential sales.
1404000	1409000	I mean, okay, yeah, I mean, the launch day should have probably been bigger, but, you
1409000	1413000	know, the month totals are smaller because of the tragedy.
1413000	1420000	Okay, well that's fine, I'll give you that, but I guarantee, and, you know, it's not gonna
1420000	1421000	catch up as quickly.
1421000	1428000	I think what the thing is, is it's not enough, I mean, the 3D, and from what I've found,
1428000	1434000	just playing stuff, the 3D's cool, but there's no real must-have titles yet.
1434000	1437000	I mean, like the stuff I bought, like Pilot Wings and Ridge Racer, it's kind of like,
1437000	1440000	okay, out of the stuff that's coming out, this is what I kind of think are the best
1440000	1444000	ones, you know, and that's it, it's not like, oh my god, I've got to have Ridge Racer
1444000	1448000	again, or oh my god, I've got to have Pilot Wings, it was just kind of, eh, okay, well,
1448000	1451000	this is what I've got to choose from, so I'm gonna pick this.
1451000	1457000	I don't think anyone's really super excited about a new Nintendogs, I mean, or Steel Diver.
1457000	1461000	That's true, I mean, it definitely hurt them to not have a Mario game, or a Zelda game,
1461000	1463000	or hell, the Kid Icarus game at launch.
1463000	1468000	Or a new IP, for god's sake, I mean, you know, how about let's create something new?
1468000	1475000	Well, Steel Diver, which I hear is kind of not all of that, but they definitely, you
1475000	1480000	know, somebody at Nintendo feels like it's a thing, so you know, there's that, that's
1480000	1481000	new.
1481000	1487000	Yeah, but it's not something that they're really promoting, it's not like, you know,
1487000	1491000	a Kirby or Mario or something like that, it's just a game that they put out.
1491000	1494000	The Wii had the Zelda game, which was like a must-have, I mean, it was just a great game.
1494000	1499000	The Nintendo 64 had Mario 64, which many will argue is one of the greatest games of all
1499000	1500000	time, period.
1500000	1501000	Right?
1501000	1502000	Mario 64 was a launch game?
1502000	1503000	Yeah.
1503000	1504000	I think, yeah.
1504000	1506000	GameCube, I don't recall having anything big.
1506000	1508000	I think it had, what, Luigi's Mansion.
1508000	1510000	Yeah, Luigi's Mansion was the big one.
1510000	1512000	Well, the first one, I guess.
1512000	1516000	So, but the GameCube also was challenged with sales to some regards, so.
1516000	1523000	And then I remember Mario 64 for the DS, and you know, Super Mario World for the Super
1523000	1526000	Nintendo, and you know, Mario Brothers for the Nintendo.
1526000	1529000	So, it's just, I don't know.
1529000	1533000	And then also, once again, you know, people are kind of looking at the 3D as kind of gimmicky,
1533000	1540000	and also knowing, you know, their track record with just, not even really peripherals with
1540000	1543000	like, their hardware, it's like, eh, well, you know what?
1543000	1546000	I'm not gonna buy one right away, because I know in like, a few months they're gonna
1546000	1549000	announce that they're gonna have a slimmer one, they're gonna mark this down or something
1549000	1554000	like that, or they're gonna add something or tweak something, and I don't really wanna
1554000	1560000	wait, or I'm gonna wait for, you know, a new stuff to come out.
1560000	1563000	Or, you know, for the actual good games to come out.
1563000	1568000	Just real quick, the GameCube launched with 12 games, and some of the highlights of those
1568000	1575000	12 games of what came out, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2,
1575000	1579000	Rogue Leader, I remember that being a really cool game, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race
1579000	1584000	Bluestorm was probably, and see, see, there's nothing in there save maybe the Star Wars
1584000	1588000	game and maybe Luigi's Mansion or Wave Race, there's nothing that really like, jumps at
1588000	1589000	you, right?
1589000	1594000	But the GameCube, of course, was also pegged for not selling nearly as well as the 64 had.
1594000	1595000	So.
1595000	1596000	Yeah.
1596000	1599000	Maybe launch titles are way more important.
1599000	1603000	But I don't know, like, is the launch that important?
1603000	1607000	See, I sort of see this as Nintendo trying to set the stage for the holidays.
1607000	1611000	I don't think Nintendo is really concerned with how this thing sells until the holidays.
1611000	1616000	Yeah, I think that's correct, but at the same time, though, they've got to try to get
1616000	1618000	people, I mean, they don't want it to fail at any part.
1618000	1623000	You know, they may not be as concerned with the numbers not being quite where they want
1623000	1627000	them to be, but it is saying something, though, when your system's not selling out.
1627000	1631000	And it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's good that people can find it when they
1631000	1632000	want it.
1632000	1636000	It's not like the WiiWare, it's just impossible to find.
1636000	1641000	But, it's, at the same time, it's, you look at what their release schedule is for the
1641000	1643000	3DS stuff, there's not a lot coming out.
1643000	1650000	I mean, it's pretty slim pickins for forever right now, because they haven't really announced
1650000	1651000	a lot of stuff.
1651000	1655000	Okay, both GameGuru and Act F'd in our chatroom were chiming in saying Super Smash Brothers
1655000	1658000	Melee was about three months after their release.
1658000	1663000	Well, but, that's, three months later is still three months later, and, you know, who's to
1663000	1666000	say we're not going to get some of these big 3DS games three months later?
1666000	1670000	We're not, because they've already announced what the launch window stuff is, and that's
1670000	1672000	from Launch Window.
1672000	1673000	I love that, Launch Window.
1673000	1678000	I'm sorry, Launch Window may be the week that it comes out, or maybe the day it comes out.
1678000	1679000	Not three months.
1679000	1683000	I don't call, you know, if you want to use that, let's say, okay, well, Xbox 360's had
1683000	1688000	a really awesome launch window this past five years, or six years.
1688000	1689000	Yeah.
1689000	1693000	I really think you can't really judge this thing until the holidays, because I think,
1693000	1696000	you know, the Kid Icarus will obviously be out by the holidays.
1696000	1697000	It better be.
1697000	1700000	I think Nintendo's going to have that stealth title that comes out at E3, which I don't
1700000	1701000	think is very stealth at all.
1701000	1705000	I'm pretty sure it's going to be Mario Brothers on the 3DS, and I think that'll be out by
1705000	1706000	the holidays.
1706000	1708000	That'll be New Super Mario Brothers 2, or something.
1708000	1711000	New Super Mario Brothers 3D, or something, you know.
1711000	1714000	That'll be their big thing that they come out and announce at the very end that's playable
1714000	1716000	on the show floor, because it's coming out this holiday.
1716000	1717000	They have some good stuff.
1717000	1719000	I mean, they have, like, well, actually...
1719000	1721000	And that thing's going to sell a shit ton of 3Ds.
1721000	1725000	And then by that time, you're going to be having 3D Netflix, you're going to be, you
1725000	1728000	know, I really think it's just so early to tell.
1728000	1736000	I don't think this system was really designed to have a huge launch.
1736000	1737000	So.
1737000	1738000	We'll see.
1738000	1739000	We'll see.
1739000	1740000	Absolutely.
1740000	1741000	All right.
1741000	1743000	Moving on to some more news.
1743000	1746000	This also has to do with handhelds and the tragedy and possibly the impact it had with
1746000	1747000	it.
1747000	1748000	The NGP.
1748000	1752000	Now, there's been a lot of back and forth with this this week, so hear me out here.
1752000	1754000	The NGP might...
1754000	1758000	They were saying earlier in the week it might not have happened this year because of the
1758000	1760000	big earthquake that happened.
1760000	1765000	And there was a report where Jack Trenton, who is the Sony Computer Entertainment America
1765000	1770000	president talking to Bloomberg saying that Sony may have to launch the next generation
1770000	1774000	portable in just one market by the end of the year, which, you know, originally they
1774000	1775000	were going to be doing it everywhere.
1775000	1778000	And, of course, a lot of people said, well, that makes sense.
1778000	1780000	You know, it's really unfortunate what happened.
1780000	1782000	But yeah, that would probably be the case.
1782000	1784000	But then it came out a little later in the week.
1784000	1786000	Wait a minute.
1786000	1791000	Jack Trenton actually said they may have to delay the release of the next generation portable.
1791000	1799000	And the bosses in Japan, namely Satoshi Furuka, who is the representative of Sony Computer
1799000	1804000	Entertainment over in Japan, said, so far we see no impact from the quake on our launch
1804000	1808000	plan, saying that the original Bloomberg report was wrong.
1808000	1809000	Period.
1809000	1813000	So, it may not be delayed after all.
1813000	1816000	Of course, this is one of those things where it's like, well, you don't really know until
1816000	1817000	E3.
1817000	1822000	So, if Sony products in the past or any history, it'll be out in Japan, then it'll be out in
1822000	1823000	the U.S. and Europe.
1823000	1826000	So, you're going to see some bit of a delay.
1826000	1832000	But, you know, I think you're going to see something where it comes out in Japan September,
1832000	1836000	October, and it comes out in the U.S. and Europe just in time for Black Friday here
1836000	1839000	in the U.S., like last week of November-ish.
1839000	1840000	Sounds likely.
1840000	1845000	And by, you know, putting out rumors of delay, it probably just raised a little bit more
1845000	1846000	of the want.
1846000	1850000	So, I still feel like that we don't know enough about really what the system is going to bring
1850000	1851000	to the table.
1851000	1853000	Yes, we had the press event before.
1853000	1856000	But, you know, a lot of stuff changes, too.
1856000	1861000	You know, and a lot of times, the things that they advertise don't really make the launch,
1861000	1862000	right?
1862000	1865000	Going back into our last story a little bit, eh?
1865000	1867000	So, anyhow.
1867000	1873000	But with the PSP, though, I don't think there's really anything they announced that didn't
1873000	1874000	make the launch.
1874000	1876000	They just added stuff later on.
1876000	1882000	Whereas Nintendo, oh yeah, all this stuff is, you know, going to be there.
1882000	1885000	Oh yeah, but it's going to be, don't worry, it's coming out in the launch window.
1885000	1886000	It won't be long.
1886000	1888000	It'll just be a couple months.
1888000	1890000	Launch window, my ass.
1890000	1891000	Come on.
1891000	1892000	Just say, listen, okay?
1892000	1893000	We put this out.
1893000	1895000	We wanted to get this out earlier.
1895000	1898000	You know, some of this stuff's not done, so.
1898000	1901000	Still a lot of DS chitter chatter in our chat room.
1901000	1904000	ActDef saying the DS launch titles were pretty bad, too.
1904000	1909000	There were some pretty bad games at launch, but it also had the Mario 64 conversion, which
1909000	1913000	had a lot of people excited, because, you know, they had changed a few things with it,
1913000	1915000	made the extra characters or something.
1915000	1920000	So, I still remember Mario 64 being a pretty big deal when that first came out on the DS.
1920000	1924000	SSG100Matt says, there needs to be a buzz for when they go into the holidays.
1924000	1928000	If there is no buzz for it, then kids won't be begging their parents to buy it for them.
1928000	1929000	That's right.
1929000	1933000	UnfoldedRaptor says, what about Super Mario Sunshine or Star Fox Adventures?
1933000	1935000	Again, both those games came way later, didn't they?
1935000	1936000	Yeah.
1936000	1938000	Especially Mario Sunshine was way later.
1938000	1939000	That was at least a year after.
1939000	1940000	So, those aren't even, you know.
1940000	1943000	And Star Fox Adventures, I think people like to forget about.
1943000	1946000	Yeah, I don't think that was considered a big hit.
1946000	1951000	DDRAngel saying, I can't remember if Animal Crossing was a late release or not.
1951000	1952000	It was.
1952000	1953000	Yeah.
1953000	1954000	I don't know if it was late, but it was more like mid.
1954000	1956000	It definitely wasn't early.
1956000	1961000	GameGuru says, besides the PlayStation 2's big title, Grand Theft Auto 3 came out a year
1961000	1963000	after the PlayStation 2's launch.
1963000	1965000	Here's the thing, though.
1965000	1969000	The PlayStation 2 had a way different thing going for it at the time.
1969000	1972000	And the big thing was, it was a DVD player.
1972000	1975000	And that was right at the time when DVDs were starting to crack.
1975000	1983000	And a lot of people were buying PlayStation 2s because, hey, it plays DVDs and it can play games.
1983000	1986000	It's the same thing that Sony was hoping would sell the PlayStation 3.
1986000	1989000	It plays Blu-rays and games.
1989000	1991000	And, you know, now it's all about this.
1991000	1994000	It plays 3D Blu-rays as well.
1994000	1997000	In fact, you know, I don't know how many of you ran out and got Tron this week,
1997000	2000000	but some of the box sets, they have stickers right on them.
2000000	2003000	Blu-ray also plays on PlayStation 3.
2003000	2007000	And it says right there on the back, to watch a Blu-ray 3D movie,
2007000	2011000	you will need a Blu-ray 3D player or a PlayStation 3.
2011000	2016000	So, you know, they're really setting up a PlayStation 3 as, like, you know, not just a game machine.
2016000	2020000	And that was the same deal with the PlayStation 2 and why it sold very well.
2020000	2026000	And it is a really good Blu-ray player because it's one that keeps itself up to date with, you know, over the networks.
2026000	2029000	And, yeah, you can with normal, like, Blu-ray players as well,
2029000	2032000	but it's a little more cumbersome than just an automatic update.
2032000	2037000	I don't know, it's just, it's good for that.
2037000	2041000	I mean, I use it for a Blu-ray player more than I use it for a game system.
2041000	2046000	Remember all the shit that people gave Xbox to when it came out because it did not play DVDs?
2046000	2051000	Unless you bought a $50 remote, the DVD playback kit.
2051000	2052000	Yeah.
2052000	2053000	Yeah.
2053000	2057000	I think a lot of people forgot how horrible that went over.
2057000	2060000	Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2060000	2061000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
2061000	2063000	I'm completely mesmerized by the sexiness.
2063000	2064000	What's that?
2064000	2069000	Well, it's a game coming out called Galaga Legion's DX.
2069000	2071000	Ooh, I want to take a look at this too.
2071000	2072000	Uh, they-
2072000	2076000	Are you playing the video?
2076000	2078000	Yes, I'm looking at the video too. I want to see this here.
2078000	2080000	Ah, pretty.
2080000	2088000	It's basically, um, tons and tons and tons of the, the Galaga Armada going against you.
2088000	2091000	You have to shoot lots and lots and lots and lots of them.
2091000	2094000	This isn't bullet hell, this is ship hell.
2094000	2098000	And it's done by the same, uh, people who did Pac-Man Championship Edition.
2098000	2100000	So, very cool.
2100000	2107000	It's got a new feature called Focus Fire, where it gives you, um, control for secondary aiming.
2107000	2110000	And, uh, it looks like it's pretty awesome.
2110000	2112000	It's got lots of pretty colors and swirlies and things.
2112000	2120000	Yeah, it almost looks like it's like, I don't know, like, Galaga meets Geometry Wars meets-
2120000	2123000	Res or some type of Q Entertainment game?
2123000	2125000	Is pretty.
2125000	2127000	Do want.
2127000	2129000	There's the Focus Fire option.
2129000	2130000	Interesting.
2130000	2135000	But it looks like one of the things is you sort of cut through them like you're making a path.
2135000	2142000	And then can, uh, sort of send out something that would destroy, like, them en masse.
2142000	2144000	So it looks pretty cool.
2144000	2145000	Very neat.
2145000	2149000	And I can, um, link the, uh, YouTube video in the chatroom.
2149000	2150000	Very cool.
2150000	2155000	I'm glad to see the Pac-Man Championship Edition team is kind of continuing forward with reimagining some other titles.
2155000	2160000	This looks a little weird, but I would definitely check out, you know, like a demo at least to see if it's something I would be into.
2160000	2162000	But, you know, I love Pac-Man Championship Edition.
2162000	2165000	And even the reimagined one, you know, they put out the second one not that long ago.
2165000	2166000	It's great too.
2166000	2168000	So, uh, that's a good team.
2168000	2170000	Reimagining some of the classics.
2170000	2172000	I wonder what other Namco classics they should revisit.
2172000	2174000	I think we should get, like, Dig Dug Hardcore.
2174000	2177000	Ah, that would be crazy.
2177000	2181000	I don't even know how that would work, but it just, in my head, it's really funny.
2181000	2189000	But it also looks like you get another one where you can get all sorts of, uh, you know how you can get your bonus ship when it takes the ship and you free it?
2189000	2190000	Mm-hmm.
2190000	2194000	It looks like you have an option similar to that, except it's got a bunch of bonus ships.
2194000	2199000	So, but it's gonna be, um, on Xbox 360 and PS3.
2199000	2200000	Of course.
2200000	2201000	Alright. Awesome.
2201000	2202000	Let's move on.
2202000	2203000	Loki.
2203000	2204000	Yeah.
2204000	2212000	Um, so there's, uh, some new announcements made by EA regarding their, uh, basketball franchises.
2212000	2222000	You may remember NBA Elite 11, uh, got cancelled last year, uh, when it was apparently revealed that it's crap.
2222000	2224000	Um, so they didn't release it.
2224000	2227000	Well, a few leaked out, but they didn't release it.
2227000	2231000	Um, well, the next simulation basketball game won't be coming this year.
2231000	2238000	It'll actually be next year, um, in fall of 2012 is when you can expect the next EA game.
2238000	2241000	They're really going back to the drawing board with that stuff.
2241000	2248000	So, um, they're saying, you know, we have top talent on the game and we're giving the new development team time to deliver a superior experience.
2248000	2253000	We're making great strides and looking forward to launching a new game next year.
2253000	2263000	And it says, uh, that lesson's, uh, that lesson about giving the team plenty of time was learned the hard way through the near release and scrapping of NBA 11.
2263000	2278000	And then, of course, uh, to fill the void for not having a new NBA, you know, simulation game, there is the NBA Jam On Fire edition that's coming to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.
2278000	2284000	And apparently it is a follow-up, of course, to NBA Jam that was released last year.
2284000	2293000	Um, and then it's going download only just like it was originally supposed to, uh, with the release of NBA Elite 11.
2293000	2297000	It was supposed to be a pack-in bonus, I guess, if you bought the game.
2297000	2311000	The On Fire edition will be getting, uh, new opponent AI, uh, revamped visuals, and I guess a host of new online features as well as an online, uh, road trip campaign mode and roster updates.
2311000	2318000	And, um, apparently the new AI's, um, gonna learn your tendencies and throw them back in your face.
2318000	2328000	And, uh, apparently the game will be $15 to $20, not $50 like it was released last year.
2328000	2333000	And really, if you ask me, it was way too expensive for a game that was originally gonna be free.
2333000	2343000	Exactly. And that, I didn't even really think of this in terms of, oh, EA needs a basketball game this year since their other one's gonna get delayed till next year.
2343000	2355000	Um, now I always thought this was kind of like, oh, I guess NBA Jam didn't really do well, so this is their way to try to make money from it by delivering it the way everybody said they thought it should have been in the first place.
2355000	2366000	It's very interesting because this whole value of a game thing has been a big theme the past year or so, you know, or at least especially since Game Developers Conference this year where they were, you know, talking about it.
2366000	2376000	Uh, you know, when they were kind of getting into that whole argument about, um, the Angry Birds developer sells their game for 99 cents, Nintendo says it devalues games as a whole, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2376000	2387000	It's very interesting where the public is kind of setting the bar for some things. Like, you talk to a lot of people and everybody's like, $50, $60, way too much to pay for NBA Jam, but I pay $15 for it.
2387000	2390000	It's like, how do you value a game? How do you price a game?
2390000	2398000	I think the reason why that they're willing to pay $15 or $20 for the game is because it was originally announced that it was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
2398000	2414000	So, what that sounds like when, you know, the consumer hears, okay, it was going to be a packing game that was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later on after NBA Elite comes out and you can purchase that separately if you didn't buy NBA Elite, you know, for $15 to $20.
2414000	2421000	Oh, but now NBA Elite gets cancelled and now it's a $50 game because they're claiming that they added some other stuff in.
2421000	2434000	Well, I'm sorry, but what did they add in that raised the price up $30? Because I can tell you this much, I've seen the Xbox Live Arcade game, back out on PartnerNet, and they didn't add much.
2434000	2447000	Definitely not $30 much. So, that's a load of bullshit right there and the fact that they're now re- I would call it a re-release, okay, so they're tweaking it a little bit and then selling it to you again.
2447000	2456000	Well, if you think about it, that is EA for you. They tweak things a little bit and then they sell it to you again. That's their sports games franchises.
2456000	2464000	I mean, I don't know, it's whatever. I mean, if you're going to buy it, cool. Honestly, last NBA Jam game didn't look that great.
2464000	2471000	I mean, it looked all- I guess it was alright, but I did without it and I can do without this next one.
2471000	2478000	But, good news I guess for 2K, at least they get another year where they have no competition whatsoever.
2478000	2488000	And there's other developers out there that are kind of taking the whole pricing structure thing and turning it on its nose, like THQ is trying with MX vs ATV Alive.
2488000	2492000	They're putting out the game for $40 new and then they're going to support it with download content.
2492000	2501000	And they're saying that's the way they're going to do things. They're going to keep adding download content on a regular basis and then make additional money that way.
2501000	2508000	Which is fine as long as it's actually new content and not just crap that they're just removed out of the game and then added back in later on.
2508000	2512000	Or like, God, I can't wait for that role-playing game to come out that costs $40.
2512000	2518000	But to beat the final boss, you need the final boss pack, which you can download for $20 on Xbox Live.
2518000	2522000	Or to finish the story, you need the epilogue pack. You know what I mean?
2522000	2523000	Yeah.
2523000	2531000	I'd be a little worried about that. Alright, we'll see what happens when this game's released. If it goes over as well as everybody thinks, it will.
2531000	2536000	Anyhow, moving on to news about Sonic the Hedgehog.
2536000	2541000	Apparently, there is a new Sonic the Hedgehog game on its way out. It's coming out for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2541000	2544000	This was announced via Sonic's Facebook page.
2544000	2550000	There was a little teaser trailer released where Sonic is running through little colored sequences of loops and so forth.
2550000	2556000	Classic Sonic is back in the game. Let's take a look. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011.
2556000	2562000	Taking a look here at the, excuse me, the little teaser video here in studio.
2562000	2565000	Let's see if we can get it to load.
2565000	2566000	Sega!
2566000	2568000	Of course. Every Sega game has to load.
2572000	2576000	I'm curious if Arasaka's got this because I know she's a big Sonic fangirl.
2576000	2577000	Oh yeah, watch this.
2577000	2583000	The graphics look pretty cool. Like, it's in high depth. Very well rendered.
2585000	2587000	Running through ramps and ice.
2587000	2588000	I think that's just a trailer.
2588000	2592000	Oh yeah, this is just a trailer. Yeah, of course, I'm sure it's pre-rendered, but...
2597000	2600000	It's weird to me how they do this whole, like, two Sonic thing.
2603000	2605000	It's new Sonic and classic Sonic.
2605000	2607000	Yeah. It's still a little weird.
2607000	2610000	It doesn't really tell me enough about the game, so...
2610000	2614000	I'm sure we'll be seeing more about it at E3, but you know what the first thing that went through my head was?
2614000	2620000	Whatever happened to Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2? Remember how they had that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 1?
2620000	2627000	Somebody linked me to a story earlier because I said the same thing on Bobby's show and I got a link to a story where I guess they say it is still in development.
2627000	2630000	As late as late February they were saying that the game is still in development, but...
2630000	2631000	How do we make it not suck?
2631000	2640000	I know, I'm kinda sitting here going, well, usually when you have an episodic game, you plan on releasing one episode a month, not one episode a year, you know?
2640000	2641000	Oh, weird.
2641000	2642000	Yeah, very odd.
2642000	2643000	What they're doing.
2643000	2650000	So, I guess there's still a Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2 coming as well, but I'm also required to care about this.
2650000	2656000	But we'll see when there's some actual gameplay footage to come out, hopefully around E3. We'll see about that, though.
2656000	2664000	Yeah, but here's my question with the whole Sonic the Hedgehog 4 stuff, is who really cares?
2664000	2676000	Because the reviews on it weren't that great, and most of the industry reviewers and the user reviews have been pretty terrible, so who cares?
2676000	2684000	I mean, that's gotta suck when you're like, okay, I gotta put out a bunch of episodes now for a game that no one gives a shit about. Damn.
2684000	2691000	Um, you know, it's also one of the things where I feel like they're always trying to reboot Sonic. Like, let's just reboot Sonic.
2691000	2697000	Oh, we should try rebooting Sonic again. It's like Sega's perennial answer. Maybe it's time to retire, Sonic.
2697000	2702000	Hate to go there, but I don't know, Sonic games have been very, very hip to us lately.
2702000	2712000	It's not that difficult to fix Sonic. You make it like it was before. The old Sonic. Don't try to add werewolves into it. Don't try to make it all weird.
2712000	2726000	Don't give him a sword. You know, just make it Sonic. Now, I know that you tried that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and it failed terribly, but you know what?
2726000	2735000	We can only help you so far, so just make it like that, but not suck. That's all you gotta do.
2735000	2742000	Alright, let's move on with another story here before we get into the release dates where we travel around the world and see what's coming out soon. DarkSakura?
2742000	2751000	Well, actually, PopCap has decided to make a new label called 4th & Battery, and you can actually check this out at 4thandbattery.com.
2751000	2766000	As all one word, number 4thandbattery.com. It is a new label to bring out experimental ideas to customer so they can be more creative, get stuff out that's a little bit, as they say, off the beaten path.
2766000	2776000	So, it's pretty cool, and looks like the first thing out is gonna be called Unpleasant Horse. And watching the trailer for this, it's very silly.
2776000	2778000	This horse is definitely not feeling pleasant.
2778000	2788000	You start off with a bird and a pegasus, and everything's happy, and then here comes a dark horse with a little skull on its butt like the evil My Little Pony.
2788000	2791000	This horse is just at the Chinese buffet, and now it's feeling very unpleasant.
2791000	2792000	Pooping lightning.
2792000	2803000	It makes me think, though, of the bad horse from Dr. Horrible. But yeah, it looks pretty interesting. Apparently, this was an idea they had before 4th and Battery came out.
2803000	2810000	But, um, they're calling this, uh, and I quote, it's a sandbox for PopCap's inner child.
2810000	2813000	Well, I'm playing some of the audio here in the studio.
2813000	2817000	Aw, it's a little birdie. No horse.
2817000	2823000	This definitely doesn't look like other PopCap games. You're like, where's the jewels to switch? Or, you know.
2823000	2826000	He farted lightning.
2826000	2832000	It's like a bad horse.
2832000	2836000	Random hard rock.
2836000	2842000	I hope it's gonna be fun. I mean, PopCap puts out, you know, pretty high quality stuff.
2842000	2850000	It was something that I thought that it got rejected because of some sort of, like, throwing horses through meat grinders or something like that.
2850000	2853000	Just, like, weird, weird stuff.
2853000	2855000	Sounds a little bit like Super Meat Boy, if that's the case.
2855000	2861000	Well, I think it was only rejected because they said it was, they classified it as, like, a family game, but it, you know, not a family game.
2861000	2864000	Horses going through meat grinders are probably not very family friendly.
2864000	2867000	Depends what kind of family you have.
2867000	2874000	I just like in this interview on the page, it says, much like Honey Badger, unpleasant horse just don't give a shit.
2874000	2876000	I'm glad for the reference to Honey Badger.
2876000	2877000	Yes, I love Honey Badger.
2877000	2885000	And unpleasant horse, his name is Bubbles. And is female.
2885000	2886000	Bubbles?
2886000	2890000	I'm looking through the interview. Her name is Bubbles.
2890000	2892000	Sorry, I just have to look at this a little bit here.
2892000	2896000	This is the Honey Badger. Watch it run in slow motion.
2896000	2900000	It's pretty badass. Look, it runs all over the place.
2900000	2906000	Whoa, watch out, says that bird. Ew, it's got a snake. Oh, it's chasing a jackal. Oh my gosh.
2906000	2909000	Oh, the Honey Badgers are just crazy.
2909000	2915000	The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.
2915000	2917000	It really doesn't give a shit.
2917000	2924000	I love that they brought Charles Nelson Reilly back from the grave to narrate that video.
2924000	2927000	Anyhow, the over 30 listeners will understand that joke.
2927000	2933000	Alright, let's move on. Let's travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you.
2933000	2938000	Charles Nelson Reilly, rise from your grave.
2938000	2940000	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
2940000	2942000	Now this week, there's a few things coming out.
2942000	2947000	Actually, today there was a couple 3DS games. Rabbids Travel in Time for 3DS.
2947000	2951000	I'll have you know this is one of the reasons why people aren't picking up games on the 3DS,
2951000	2956000	because this game is just a port of the one that was on the DS, now with some 3D in it.
2956000	2962000	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for the 3DS looked like a game that was made for the DS.
2962000	2965000	That's also out on the 3DS this week.
2965000	2968000	Spongebob Squiggle Pants for uDraw.
2968000	2972000	It's kind of like WarioWare, but it requires the THQ uDraw tablet.
2972000	2976000	So, WarioWare for like Mario Paint.
2976000	2979000	That's out on the Wii.
2979000	2984000	A re-release of Attack of the Movies 3D, bundled with four blaster controllers.
2984000	2988000	Trying to hit up the budget game market there.
2988000	2990000	That's on the Wii.
2990000	2995000	Lego Battle Ninja Go on the Nintendo DS.
2995000	3000000	Karaoke Revolution Glee being re-released to put the game by itself without the microphones.
3000000	3002000	That's coming out this week.
3002000	3005000	As well as, I believe, let's see here.
3005000	3007000	Oh, Fantastic Pets.
3007000	3010000	This is a game from THQ.
3010000	3017000	It's supposed to kind of cash in on that wonderful franchise created by Connectamals.
3017000	3031000	Except, you know, instead of raising tigers and whatnot, you get to raise unicorns and lizards that turn into dragons and cats that turn into purple cats.
3031000	3035000	That's on the 360 for Kinect.
3035000	3037000	Dance Dance Revolution.
3037000	3040000	Might have forgotten about that game for the other systems.
3040000	3042000	Now it's finally coming out on 360.
3042000	3044000	The bundle for 40 bucks.
3044000	3046000	That's a great price for the bundle.
3046000	3051000	Elements of War on PC.
3051000	3055000	Trackmania Turbo Build to Race on the Nintendo DS.
3055000	3058000	Divinity II the Dragon Knight Saga.
3058000	3065000	Kind of a redone version of Divinity II for Xbox 360 being released this week.
3065000	3071000	Rio, the game tie-in for the upcoming animated movie.
3071000	3076000	Coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii.
3076000	3079000	Squinkies.
3079000	3083000	This is what Activision's decided to spend their time on.
3083000	3090000	It is like those little toys that you find in the 25 cent bubble machines or whatever.
3090000	3094000	Yeah, something I don't understand.
3094000	3096000	That's coming out on DS.
3096000	3099000	And Potapon 3 on PSP this week.
3099000	3104000	Michael Jackson the Experience coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
3104000	3106000	Are you going to buy that?
3106000	3109000	You know what, actually I am looking forward to picking it up on 360.
3109000	3111000	So I will check that out.
3111000	3114000	What is it about the Michael Jackson experience that you're looking forward to?
3114000	3116000	Oh, I just like the dancing games.
3116000	3119000	Did you ever buy that one dancing game that came out?
3119000	3122000	It's not Dance Masters, it's not Dance Central.
3122000	3124000	Dance Paradise? Is that what it's called?
3124000	3125000	No.
3125000	3126000	Really? I was looking at it.
3126000	3127000	No, it looked terrible.
3127000	3129000	I got it and then I put it back on the shelf.
3129000	3130000	Yeah, it looks terrible.
3130000	3132000	But it has Lady Gaga!
3132000	3134000	That doesn't make me buy things though, Rob.
3134000	3136000	It makes me buy things.
3136000	3139000	It just looked terrible.
3139000	3145000	And then let's see what else we've got here.
3145000	3148000	Not much else really this week.
3148000	3153000	I was looking, I actually saw some of these things that made me kind of scratch my head.
3153000	3156000	They had like this Rocco game capture device.
3156000	3160000	It didn't really say what resolution it captured in it, so I could not buy that.
3160000	3165000	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
3165000	3166000	Pretty much it for this week.
3166000	3169000	Good stuff though in two weeks though.
3169000	3171000	Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.
3171000	3172000	I know, it's a big week.
3172000	3173000	Squeeze.
3173000	3174000	Damn, there went all my money.
3174000	3175000	Lots of Squeeze.
3175000	3178000	It's going to be a shopping spree at Fry's.
3178000	3179000	I'm still looking forward to hearing that.
3179000	3182000	And a shopping Squeeze.
3182000	3187000	Alright, moving on to Japan. Let's see what you can Squeeze about for the release dates over there.
3187000	3192000	Cross Channel in memory of all people coming out on the Xbox 360 as well as Homefront.
3192000	3194000	Both getting their Japanese releases this week.
3194000	3197000	Lost Planet 2 moves into the Platinum Collection this week over there as well.
3197000	3201000	Trying to look up this Cross Channel in memory of all people and see what this is about.
3201000	3203000	I want to see if this is a game that's out over here.
3203000	3209000	It's from Cyberfront and I'm not seeing a whole lot with it except a scene where the characters are in swimsuits.
3209000	3212000	So this is definitely some type of anime.
3212000	3216000	It's one of those anime games that's just not going to come over here because we don't get games like that here.
3216000	3219000	Interactive stories is what they look like to me.
3219000	3226000	Why don't we have, and this is a total random topic here, why don't we have like a telenovela game?
3226000	3229000	Because that would be just so random.
3229000	3230000	A Telemundo game?
3230000	3231000	Yes, a Telemundo game.
3231000	3233000	Sabado Higante the game.
3233000	3235000	A bunch of little mini games on the Wii.
3235000	3237000	It would be different.
3237000	3239000	There's been nothing.
3239000	3240000	It would be awesome.
3240000	3245000	I would like to see them go back and take the old Sentos franchises.
3245000	3248000	The Mexican wrestler superhero.
3248000	3249000	That would be awesome.
3249000	3251000	Well they did have the Mexican wrestling game.
3251000	3252000	Yeah, and it sucked.
3252000	3256000	But I'm talking about something ridiculous.
3256000	3258000	Like Italian Spiderman.
3258000	3260000	Even though that's not real.
3260000	3266000	It would still be awesome to take that fake character and make an Italian Spiderman game.
3266000	3273000	I'm trying to see what type of shows are on Telemundo these days that they could make a show out of.
3273000	3275000	Of course this thing is trying to...
3275000	3277000	Let's see, what are the...
3277000	3279000	I don't know what the big shows on Telemundo are.
3279000	3281000	I don't really watch it.
3281000	3283000	There's Shakira.
3283000	3286000	Alright, this is a terrible segment. Let me move on with the releases.
3286000	3288000	PlayStation 3.
3288000	3291000	Lost Planet 2 also gets a price reduction there.
3291000	3293000	Homefront comes out on there as well.
3293000	3296000	There's also a game called Pro Yaku Spirits 2011.
3296000	3297000	Baseball.
3297000	3299000	From Konami. Yep, it's a baseball sim.
3299000	3300000	Trying to see...
3300000	3303000	It looked, from the cover for a minute, it looked like it was kind of like chibi basketball.
3303000	3305000	But no, this is like real-deal Japanese...
3305000	3306000	I'm sorry, basketball.
3306000	3307000	Japanese baseball.
3307000	3309000	So this is Japanese baseball.
3309000	3310000	Actually it looks really good.
3310000	3311000	Yeah.
3311000	3313000	I have a friend on LiveJournal who will be really into that.
3313000	3315000	She loves her Japanese baseball.
3315000	3322000	Let's see, also coming out, WRC Fia World Rally Championship.
3322000	3324000	That's a racing game if you didn't know.
3324000	3325000	From Deep Silver.
3325000	3328000	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
3328000	3331000	Trying to see if they have anything coming out on there this week.
3331000	3332000	They don't.
3332000	3334000	But next week you can get Billy's Bootcamp.
3334000	3338000	Wii Day Enjoy Diet.
3338000	3340000	Yet another game there.
3340000	3342000	Coming out this week on the 3DS in Japan.
3342000	3343000	Pilotwings Resort.
3343000	3345000	They didn't get it at launch, but they're getting it now.
3345000	3347000	Pilotwings Resort comes out this week in Japan.
3347000	3354000	Also Pro Yaku Spirits 2011, so the baseball sim comes out on the 3DS this week as well.
3354000	3360000	And lastly on the PSP this week, we have Last Rancor gets a price reduction.
3360000	3366000	We have Dai Tu Zhi Super Robot Taisen Zee Hakai Hen comes out this week as well.
3366000	3368000	That's Robot Wars series.
3368000	3369000	And that's coming out.
3369000	3373000	It's a strategy game on the PSP if you like those games.
3373000	3378000	And lastly, Persona 2 Sumi, Innocent Sin comes out this week.
3378000	3383000	So if you're a fan of the Persona series, I think this is like a spinoff series that's on the portable.
3383000	3385000	It might be like a remake or something.
3385000	3387000	Yeah, that's available this week on the PSP.
3387000	3388000	So check it out.
3388000	3390000	Sounds fun.
3390000	3393000	Well we have just a few things coming out in Europe.
3393000	3397000	On 12th we have World of Tanks for the PC.
3397000	3402000	On the 15th, Lego Ninja Go, the video game on the DS.
3402000	3406000	And also Michael Jackson, the experience on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3406000	3410000	They don't get the Mortal Kombat joy until after we do.
3410000	3412000	So, just saying.
3412000	3414000	Those poor guys always have to wait.
3414000	3416000	Portal 2 is out on my birthday, hint, hint.
3416000	3418000	Everybody.
3418000	3421000	I have a Steam account.
3421000	3423000	Alright.
3423000	3427000	I want to get the PlayStation 3 one so I get the PS3 game and the Steam game, right?
3427000	3429000	I have a PS3.
3429000	3431000	That's what I plan to do.
3431000	3433000	Alright, moving on.
3433000	3438000	So this week, a hacking group named Anonymous.
3438000	3442000	Oh, I had a feeling it was Anonymous.
3442000	3444000	Yeah.
3444000	3446000	Anonymous.
3446000	3455000	They are now apparently, I guess, battling Sony now because they're saying,
3455000	3463000	We are currently investigating including the possibility of targeted behavior from an outside party.
3463000	3465000	Yes, they were getting hacked.
3465000	3467000	They already said.
3467000	3476000	Apparently, the group said they declare loyalty to GeoHot and Raph Chocolo.
3476000	3486000	Two hackers, well, GeoHot, obviously, the one, has the keys that people want.
3486000	3491000	Release some of them so that people can actually start doing homebrew stuff.
3491000	3498000	And Raph Chocolo was behind bringing Linux back to the PS3 and he's a big part of that.
3498000	3502000	In fact, he's still actually doing hacking stuff based on that.
3502000	3513000	Basically, they're saying they're attacking Sony's private property because we disagree with their actions.
3513000	3519000	And they're going to keep on doing that.
3519000	3526000	So they were attacking the PlayStation Network and Sony's websites and stuff like that.
3526000	3535000	Of course, I guess, they realize that attacking the PlayStation Network kind of hurts the people that they're trying to fight for.
3535000	3539000	So they're saying, OK, we decided that we're not going to attack the PlayStation Network at this time,
3539000	3546000	but they're going to find different ways to attack Sony, I guess.
3546000	3553000	One of them being that they're going to, I guess, reveal a bunch of information about Sony's upper management,
3553000	3567000	including crazy stuff like all their personal information, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, pictures of their family, where they live, all sorts of crazy stuff.
3567000	3570000	See, some of that stuff gets a little cray cray.
3570000	3580000	The DOS attack is one thing, but the whole pictures of family, when you start involving kids, I don't think anybody's comfortable with that.
3580000	3584000	But then you've got to wonder, maybe that's just a smear campaign. I don't know.
3584000	3587000	The whole point is just to make them feel uncomfortable, I think.
3587000	3594000	Anonymous, I mean, I'm going to plead a little bit ignorance here because I don't really fully understand what's going on there.
3594000	3602000	I know it's a big group. I know there's a lot of people. I know about the in-person stuff they do with Scientology, and I know it's kind of a spin off of 4chan.
3602000	3606000	I love the logo. The logo is fucking awesome.
3606000	3610000	So nobody's really in charge there because it's Anonymous?
3610000	3611000	No, no one's really in charge.
3611000	3613000	They actually grew on 4chan.
3613000	3617000	So it's like a Borg thing. It's a group collective, right?
3617000	3619000	Is that how it works?
3619000	3621000	I'm sure there's people behind it, but...
3621000	3624000	It all runs on groupthink? Because it's...
3624000	3641000	Surely somebody in Anonymous says, dude, pictures of families, not okay. It's one thing to order illegitimate pizzas and send them to Sony headquarters, but when you start posting pictures of people's kids, that's too much.
3641000	3648000	And then... Sony, Sony, Sony.
3648000	3659000	And this is the thing too, especially with any kind of radical type group, it's that if they don't follow through on the threat, no one's going to take them seriously.
3659000	3664000	Oh, they won't do that. But the thing is, I'm pretty damn sure they will.
3664000	3678000	And it's that sort of, I hate to put it this way, but sort of like integrity, if you know what I mean? The fact that if they say they're going to do it, they're going to do it.
3678000	3683000	That gets people, you know, listening to them.
3683000	3691000	Well, the other thing they were too pissed off about was the fact that Sony was collecting the IP addresses for everybody that visited GeoHot's site.
3691000	3693000	Well, that was ridiculous.
3693000	3702000	And they're saying, no, if you do anything with that, you go after anybody, you're going to have hell to pay.
3702000	3709000	So, the other thing is, okay, I don't understand these companies.
3709000	3716000	Basically, Sony hired this outside company to help protect them during this DDOS attack.
3716000	3729000	So, they have the hosting provider for Sony, they're belittling Anonymous' cyber attack, calling it medium strength, and something that's only annoyed our network engineers.
3729000	3736000	Why would you say something like that? That's just going to piss them off and make them try harder.
3736000	3743000	Do people not learn? Oh, our system's unhackable! It's the most secure system ever!
3743000	3748000	Oh, your attack was pathetic! I've seen worse from my ground!
3748000	3751000	It's like, seriously, why would you do that?
3751000	3753000	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they acknowledged it at all.
3753000	3758000	It's like, oh great, thank you dumbass that had to open your mouth. Now you're going to...
3758000	3764000	It's just going to piss them off. That's all you're doing. You're just going to piss them off now.
3764000	3768000	Great. Can't wait to see what happens this week.
3768000	3770000	Piss who off?
3770000	3774000	See, that's just the part, you know...
3774000	3786000	I don't know. There's definitely got to be a lot of varying opinions within that group, such as like, how far do you go?
3786000	3792000	So, you know. I don't know. We'll see what happens.
3792000	3800000	Well, we know what this one guy did. There's one individual that did something in it. Had to do a little bit with hacking and so forth.
3800000	3804000	It has to do with Xbox. Since we talked about Sony, let's talk about Xbox.
3804000	3809000	This was an Xbox Live user who'd been banned from the service over 35 times.
3809000	3815000	He went out and did some bad things to Steven Toulouse. I think I'm saying that right. It might be Toulouse.
3815000	3823000	Sorry if I'm saying that wrong. But he's one of the executives and this guy is big up on Xbox Live. Like, he's pretty much the head of Xbox Live.
3823000	3827000	And this guy actually ended up essentially hacking the Xbox Live account.
3827000	3831000	But I want to point out, he didn't hack through Xbox Live.
3831000	3837000	He hacked the computer that sent the email for the password reset to get to the Xbox Live account.
3837000	3840000	So, you know, your Xbox Live account is fine for now.
3840000	3844000	This guy did this to kind of get his point across.
3844000	3850000	Obviously, the guy is the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live. So, it's not like he couldn't get his own account back.
3850000	3856000	The hacker is named Predator and he basically made a whole little boasting thing on YouTube.
3856000	3864000	And, I don't know, it was kind of like talking a lot about how he's doing them a favor and so forth. I don't know. Kind of weird.
3864000	3868000	I think he's trying to be one of those hackers that really wants to get hired by the company.
3868000	3870000	But I don't know if that's really the best way to go about doing it.
3870000	3874000	But you know how companies will hire hackers to help improve the integrity of the system?
3874000	3878000	I think maybe that's what this guy is trying to do, but he's going about it the wrong way.
3878000	3883000	Especially if you get banned from Xbox Live 35 times, you're probably just a dick, dude.
3883000	3885000	It means they probably don't want to deal with you at all.
3885000	3889000	Yeah. So, this probably wasn't the best way to get your point across.
3889000	3893000	Maybe a nice little heartfelt, I'm sorry. Be better. I don't know.
3893000	3901000	Alright, anyhow, we're going to now walk through Classic Game Archives and... what's that?
3901000	3902000	You should start with the old music first.
3902000	3907000	Okay, yeah. The Classic Game of the Week is the next segment. Thank you for totally derailing me.
3907000	3909000	Sorry!
3909000	3916000	Every week on the show we have a segment where DarkSakura looks in the Classic Gaming vault and picks out one game that she says,
3916000	3921000	Hey! You kids ought to be checking this out this week. It's the Classic Game of the Week.
3921000	3922000	DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
3922000	3927000	It's actually two games. It's Killer Instinct, both one and two, because I had to put them together.
3927000	3929000	Alright.
3929000	3931000	But the first one's really the best.
3931000	3936000	Let's check out some of this music. The ambience from Killer Instinct 1.
3936000	3941000	This used to be my favorite music in the game, was killer music.
3941000	3949000	Anyway, Killer Instinct was developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo and was in the arcades in 1994.
3949000	3954000	And it was rumored to use the Ultra 64 hardware engine.
3954000	3962000	In fact, there was actually this teaser for it being on Nintendo Ultra 64, if anyone remembers that.
3962000	3967000	But this game had a pretty unique system for it.
3967000	3975000	It had some moves that were very similar to how Street Fighter worked, but also had Mortal Kombat style finishing moves.
3975000	3984000	And a few other kind of neat things. It had a double energy bar, so that instead of winning two rounds, you actually just had two bars of energy.
3984000	3989000	When you finished one up, the fight would pause and your new bar would fill up, so that's how it worked.
3989000	3994000	You had combos that if you pressed the buttons in a certain order, they would just auto combo.
3994000	4003000	And then you had your finishers that are called No Mercy, although other versions called it a danger move.
4003000	4009000	And it was basically, you know, violent finishers, like an orchid would flash your boobs and the other person would die of a heart attack.
4009000	4014000	Unless it was another orchid, then she'd just stomp her feet and be jealous. That was cute.
4014000	4019000	And then you also had humiliations where it would make people dance, and they had different dance styles.
4019000	4026000	You had the Ultra combo that was, basically they'd just go into this huge ass auto combo.
4026000	4033000	But with some of the characters you could actually keep re-juggling with extra hits at the end of the combo, so you could get over 80 hits.
4033000	4037000	I was always really good at the 44 hit combo with orchid.
4037000	4049000	Anyway, you also had combo breakers where if you either hit in the double digits or were in the combo link stage, you could do this little move and it would break the combo.
4049000	4058000	A combo breaker! Anyway, so it was pretty neat. You also could do these advanced moves right after you did a combo breaker.
4058000	4062000	Like, Jago for example would have a red fireball instead of the green one.
4062000	4069000	So your characters in the first one were Fulgore, Cinder, Glaceous, Jago, Riptor, Saberwolf, Spinal, who was actually the second to last.
4069000	4074000	No, the third to- the second to last. Because I think Fulgore was after him and then it was idle.
4074000	4079000	Anyway, TJ combo, Chief Thunder, orchid, well it says B orchid I guess it's supposed to be black orchid, and idle.
4079000	4086000	Who didn't have any special moves at all, except he could refill his life by stomping on the ground.
4086000	4091000	It was also the first arcade game that had an internal hard drive.
4091000	4096000	And the game was actually done in pre-rendered sprites that was done by Silicon Graphics.
4096000	4103000	And the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a movie, but the frames would adjust based on where the characters were.
4103000	4111000	So it was pretty cool. It also used the R4600 processor. It's pretty cool.
4111000	4113000	And, oh you film?
4113000	4116000	I'm just jumping to random ones, playing a little bit before you get to the second game.
4116000	4120000	There was a SNES version, it had a lot of stuff cut out and way panned out.
4120000	4128000	But it came with Killer Cuts, which was a 16 track remix version of all the songs.
4128000	4134000	And you could actually order it through Nintendo Power, or you could get the CD if you bought the game.
4134000	4136000	I got mine because I bought the game.
4136000	4144000	And it was in a black case. There was a Game Boy version, but if you played it on the Super Game Boy, it had actually limited color added to it.
4144000	4149000	And you could play it two player, and they actually really toned down a lot of the characters' moves.
4149000	4157000	For the Nintendo 64, there was not a Killer Instinct or Killer Instinct 2, but you had Killer Instinct Gold that was based off of Killer Instinct 2.
4157000	4163000	And that leads us to Killer Instinct 2! Yay!
4163000	4165000	How about some new music, Rob?
4165000	4166000	Working on it.
4166000	4168000	Okay.
4168000	4173000	Killer Instinct 2 is the sequel, and they changed moves.
4173000	4175000	Annoying.
4175000	4177000	Which one is this?
4177000	4179000	Working.
4179000	4185000	Yeah, that was the CD version.
4185000	4194000	But it was really cool. This was my favorite music in the game.
4194000	4201000	Now, I'll tell you, when Dan got Killer Instinct Gold, I had him, because you had to keep starting the game over to get the right music.
4201000	4206000	And he actually recorded an MP3 of this for me, because I wanted it that badly.
4206000	4207000	I was a big nerd.
4207000	4211000	This is when we were first friends on the interwebs.
4211000	4227000	But KI2 basically had similar control, and it had the whole life bar thing the way that Killer Instinct was.
4227000	4232000	And I had auto combos, but they changed a few things.
4232000	4241000	Some of the normal moves, though, were toned down, and then you also had different blocking moves that were thrown in.
4241000	4243000	You also had throws, too.
4243000	4248000	And then there were ways to glitch a combo and do different moves along with that.
4248000	4256000	It basically had sort of a rock-paper-scissors system with how certain moves could be tied to certain moves.
4256000	4258000	And it was really bizarre.
4258000	4261000	Killer Instinct 2, for me, was a lot harder of a game.
4261000	4265000	And then you had a super bar where you could fill it up when you take damage.
4265000	4271000	And then you could do a huge super move, which was an extended version of the regular move.
4271000	4281000	And it had actually a parry system, so you could counter-attack after a block, and all kinds of different stuff.
4281000	4287000	It was new finishing moves, all kinds of new stuff, and no humiliations, though.
4287000	4290000	But every character had two ultimate combos.
4290000	4292000	And you could still do ultra combos.
4292000	4300000	So, with the characters in this one, the ones that came back were Full Gore-Jago's final TJ combo, Glaceous Saberwolf, and Orchid.
4300000	4303000	And all of her moves changed. It was so weird.
4303000	4307000	And then the new characters were Maya, who was the one that I used the most.
4307000	4311000	And according to Nintendo Power, she was the worst dress of 1996.
4311000	4313000	She had nice boobies.
4313000	4316000	And Tusk, who was, like, her dude.
4316000	4323000	Kim Wu, who was actually pretty fun. And Gargos, who was a demon lord, who was the rival of Eidol.
4323000	4326000	Ooh. And you could only use him with a cheat code.
4326000	4332000	So, they had different endings based on how you beat the game.
4332000	4341000	So, like, Jago's was different based on if he kills Orchid or if he kills Full Gore.
4341000	4344000	It's weird stuff, but they had all kinds of different stuff.
4344000	4351000	With Kill Instinct Gold, which is the Nintendo 64 version that I said before, it was a near-launch title.
4351000	4355000	And it did downgrade a few things, but it was pretty darn faithful.
4355000	4359000	You had team battles where you could fight with up to 11 characters.
4359000	4365000	You had elimination battles, training and advanced training, and a full option menu where you could modify stuff.
4365000	4373000	Like, how fast the game went, the color of the blood button configuration, and your controller pack data and unlockable content, like different colors.
4373000	4378000	And different scenarios and faster speeds of the game. You could make it, like, super fast.
4378000	4387000	And most of the full motion video scenes were pretty much removed because, hi, it was a Nintendo 64, it was a cartridge.
4387000	4393000	And so they did simple animations instead.
4393000	4400000	And the game was fully rendered in 3D instead of the whole scaling full motion video.
4400000	4406000	So it was pretty close to being good.
4406000	4411000	And there actually was some censorship about that around Orchid.
4411000	4426000	In the full version, there was a scene with Orchid in the introduction, and they actually played it on a UK show called Game Master,
4426000	4431000	but it was cut when the arcade release came out, so maybe someone can fight it on YouTube. Who knows?
4431000	4442000	But it won four Nintendo Power Awards, and has a really good soundtrack called the Killer Instinct Gold Cuts soundtrack.
4442000	4446000	And that's it.
4446000	4450000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Killer Instincts 1 and 2.
4450000	4452000	I guess 2 will have to share the stage this week.
4452000	4453000	Let's just say gold.
4453000	4454000	Fine, Killer Instinct Gold.
4454000	4456000	But with major nods to the arcade versions.
4456000	4457000	You got it.
4457000	4463000	Alright, that's going to do it for part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more to cover when we come back.
4463000	4469000	When we come back, we're going to get into some things such as some rapid fire news, including news on Ninja Gaiden 3.
4469000	4472000	Not the old one on the NES, but for new consoles.
4472000	4477000	Talk a little bit more about Michael Jackson The Experience, some new tracks coming out for Rock Band,
4477000	4482000	some changes going on at GameStop, and Atari reboots on iOS devices.
4482000	4487000	We're going to talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4487000	4493000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, April the 10th of 2011,
4493000	4498000	as we do tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
4498000	4503000	Now, we can't play the music on the podcast feed, but I have to mention this.
4503000	4506000	That last song cut off rather awkwardly, didn't it?
4506000	4508000	It was kind of suddenly like, and we're live.
4508000	4511000	I can play clips. You can get away with playing clips on podcasts.
4511000	4515000	We were playing a track called Work It Out from, what is this, Sonic R, right?
4515000	4518000	So let me just play, let me play the last like 10 seconds of the MP3 here,
4518000	4521000	and you get to see how awkwardly this cut off.
4521000	4526000	I'm jamming, I'm jamming, I'm jamming, and it's done.
4526000	4529000	You just kind of cut off.
4529000	4531000	I hate how video game soundtracks kind of do that sometimes,
4531000	4535000	but they're usually set up that way because they loop over and over again, so they don't like really fade out.
4535000	4538000	So that's how usually you can tell the song that was kind of ripped from the game,
4538000	4541000	or if it was for a CD, usually it will fade out on a CD
4541000	4545000	because they don't want those awkward transitions like that, so.
4545000	4550000	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into Twitter topics.
4550000	4555000	Of course, this is the last call for tweets at, at OLR on Twitter, so we're getting those in.
4555000	4558000	We have a few, I like more random questions on the Twitter tonight.
4558000	4560000	You know, video game questions are cool too.
4560000	4562000	If you want to talk about news, that's fine. Link us to stories.
4562000	4565000	I want some random questions, random gaming questions.
4565000	4569000	Also, we always like to plug our other projects that we work on.
4569000	4572000	Dark Soccer has another podcast if you like OLR you might like.
4572000	4578000	It is called Comic Insanity, and it is me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and we talk about comics.
4578000	4582000	And we did not have a show this week, but next week.
4582000	4583000	Frown.
4583000	4584000	We will have a show.
4584000	4585000	Smile.
4585000	4587000	Grin. Happy face.
4587000	4588000	Any more bigs?
4588000	4591000	You can check us at infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.
4591000	4593000	Any more big celebrities planned for your show?
4593000	4594000	You had some guy that was on Heroes.
4594000	4596000	He was really cool. Todd Stashwick.
4596000	4597000	Really nice guy.
4597000	4598000	Who is he?
4598000	4599000	Todd Stashwick.
4599000	4604000	He was in season 4, so unfortunately it was after I stopped watching.
4604000	4607000	He's been in Buffy and Supernatural.
4607000	4610000	Fine. What was his power?
4610000	4612000	He was the multiple man.
4612000	4615000	Oh. Multiplicity sucked.
4615000	4617000	The power to make you listen to any podcast.
4617000	4620000	But he's a really cool guy. Really, really nice.
4620000	4625000	And, uh, there's more coming.
4625000	4627000	It's hard being an actor in Hollywood, too.
4627000	4631000	Like, if I had been offered the role of a hero that just made people defecate on command.
4631000	4634000	That would be awesome!
4634000	4639000	They call me the Brown Note.
4639000	4643000	If Rob thought of his nickname, it would be Poopy Pants.
4643000	4645000	There you go.
4645000	4647000	Well, excuse me, Mr. Poopy Pants.
4647000	4650000	Defecating on command? Where do I sign?
4650000	4652000	The Defecator.
4652000	4653000	Nice.
4653000	4654000	The Defecatrix.
4654000	4658000	Well, now that I've brought defecation and your show in the same sentence, I apologize for that.
4658000	4661000	But anything else you want to say about Comic Insanity?
4661000	4662000	We're awesome. Listen to us.
4662000	4669000	Alright. My Side Project is a show with the one and only X Tufur called The Best Lil' Horde House in Azeroth.
4669000	4672000	Called Horde House for short. Visit us at www.hordehouse.com.
4672000	4676000	If you like World of Warcraft, or even if you don't, you just like digging fart jokes, join us every week.
4676000	4680000	We put new shows up about Friday. We don't tape live right now. Maybe someday.
4680000	4683000	We definitely want to get back into that at some point.
4683000	4687000	I do want to throw this out there. Hordehouse.com is the website behind it.
4687000	4691000	And we've been having more and more people kind of write for the site.
4691000	4694000	And by more I mean one other person, but we have another one planned too.
4694000	4700000	And one of the articles you just posted about How to Closet Your Dragon was the article.
4700000	4707000	It's about how Blizzard has kind of deflamboyantized one of the monsters that was in Warcraft.
4707000	4709000	It's been getting a ton of hits through Reddit.
4709000	4714000	It's like a controversial article and I'm very excited because it's only like the third blog post on our site.
4714000	4716000	So, big things in the future at Horde House.
4716000	4719000	Lots of hordes to talk about.
4719000	4723000	Alright. That's it. Let's move into some rapid fire news.
4723000	4725000	And then we'll get to your tweets.
4725000	4728000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R one more time.
4728000	4735000	Loki. The latest issue of the official PlayStation Magazine had some neat little tidbits regarding the new Ninja Gaiden game.
4735000	4741000	Ninja Gaiden 3, which is going to be 3. Not Sigma 3. Just 3. Both systems.
4741000	4744000	You know, all playing around harmoniously.
4744000	4750000	There is some info. They're saying that there's going to be a complex multiplayer mode.
4750000	4755000	They're not really drawing comparisons with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
4755000	4760000	But, you know, that sounds neat.
4760000	4763000	I mean, everybody has multiplayer nowadays, so why not?
4763000	4769000	They're saying that also Ryu is going to be the only playable character in the game this time around.
4769000	4777000	None of these all, you know, bonus characters from Dead or Alive or, you know, the DS or whatever.
4777000	4784000	They're also saying that there are going to be, you know, many difficulty levels, I guess.
4784000	4795000	They're not necessarily making the game easier, but they're going to try to make the game more exciting and being able to be enjoyed by everybody, as well as hardcore gamers.
4795000	4801000	So, I'm assuming you'll probably hear more at E3 about this game, because it sounds like a pretty big one.
4801000	4806000	Then, of course, Japan. Japan, Japan, Japan.
4806000	4813000	They put out a lot of weird games in Japan, and there's a couple highlights that were on blogs this week.
4813000	4824000	One comes from Famitsu. It's a cell phone game that's called I Love Woman's Body Climber.
4824000	4831000	Basically, the premise is you climb up girls, and you are climbing them.
4831000	4840000	For example, it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus, but with schoolgirl anime chicks, and you're this tiny little dude.
4840000	4850000	So, you have to, for example, it's harder to climb up bare skin than, say, pull yourself up on one of their sailor suits or whatever.
4850000	4859000	Weird shit, but it's interesting. It sells for, I guess, 315 yen, which is relatively cheap.
4859000	4862000	Does the little song play while you're climbing the woman?
4862000	4872000	It should, though.
4872000	4880000	You know what, people? Since the big thing is to now knock off games on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.
4880000	4884000	There you go. That's a niche that's not being filled with weird shit like that.
4884000	4892000	Scale woman's bodies to yodel music. That'd be awesome. Seriously, that would be just amazing.
4892000	4897000	That was inspired by the cliffhangers game on The Price is Right, by the way, when a little dude climbs the mountain.
4897000	4902000	Yodels? Forget it. Lots of old-school game show references on tonight's show.
4902000	4919000	Okay, let's see. The next game, which I'm going to try to pronounce here, but I probably will do a bad job of it. It's Gachi Tora, Abrarenbo, Kyoshi in High School.
4919000	4936000	And basically, this looks like a weird high school game with a system called the Soul Nude Battle System. And what the Soul Nude Battle System is, apparently you can...
4936000	4938000	I hope this isn't a Kinect game.
4938000	4951000	You can break a wall. It says you can break a wall the student has placed around her heart by screaming at them or something, using soul words.
4951000	4959000	So why do I have a feeling like, you know, a chef being in there, you know? Chef's Soul Nude Battle System.
4959000	4966000	Basically, you scream at people and they take off their clothes, or their clothes come off. So that's what that's about, and that's on the PSP.
4966000	4979000	What's also weird though, on top of all that, I guess you also can play baseball and do some other weird minigames in there, but it just looks very oddball.
4979000	4983000	Screaming at someone and makes them naked. If only that worked.
4983000	4996000	It's almost like Pee Wee's secret word of the day. When someone says the word of the day, scream real loud.
4996000	4999000	And then last but not least...
4999000	5001000	Clothes fly off like the Minnie Hill Show.
5001000	5015000	Little bit of a disappointment. Come on, Nintendo. Why? Why? Why? DSiWare. I guess, you know, the DSi shop, although not available yet, much like the Wii Shop originally worked.
5015000	5021000	Games from the DSi shop cannot be run off of an SD memory card.
5021000	5033000	And while the Wii had a patch later on that allowed you to do that, the DSi does not allow you that. You have to put the game on the internal memory and that's where it's going to stay.
5033000	5036000	And that's it.
5036000	5045000	It says apparently though, of course, the 3DSWare and Virtual Console games will be able to directly play off an SD card.
5045000	5054000	DSiWare that you buy new or transfer over on the 3DS still requires you to store it to the internal memory of the 3DS.
5054000	5058000	It's kind of a step backwards, I guess.
5058000	5060000	Is that like their copy protection?
5060000	5069000	No, it doesn't make any sense. DSiWare is the only thing that's stuck like that. 3DSWare or Virtual Console stuff? Oh, you can put that back and forth.
5069000	5071000	DSiWare? No.
5071000	5073000	That's weird.
5073000	5078000	Must be something about the, I don't know, emulating or something, I don't know.
5078000	5083000	Something that they have running on there probably is limiting it, but I mean, come on. Just patch that shit.
5083000	5088000	Well, but I mean, let's be real, Loki. Is there anything on DSiWare that you really have to play that bad?
5088000	5091000	Yes, actually there is something now that you mentioned it.
5091000	5092000	Uh oh.
5092000	5094000	It was something that didn't make our show roll, but it's pretty awesome.
5094000	5099000	It's a DSiWare application, not even really a game. It's called Inchworm Animation.
5099000	5113000	And this thing is just fucking crazy. Basically, it's an animation program developed by Bob Sebastian from Flat Black Films, the company responsible for rotoscoping in The Waking Life and in the Scanner Darkly.
5113000	5119000	And apparently this game or program or whatever you want to do, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.
5119000	5125000	You can do rotoscoping, you can do green screen, you can do time lapse photography using this.
5125000	5133000	You can make your own animations, all sorts of crazy stuff for five dollars. Five dollars.
5133000	5138000	Seriously, they could have sold this shit for, you know, thirty dollars and been able to sell a ton of it.
5138000	5140000	But yeah, that's coming out April 25th.
5140000	5144000	Nice. Alright. Well, let's move on.
5144000	5150000	Of course, I can't play it on April 25th because they haven't released a damn store yet for, you know, the 3DS.
5150000	5154000	Oh, sorry, we didn't finish that part of the 3DS.
5154000	5158000	Well, something you will be able to buy whenever it does come out, you don't know Jack.
5158000	5163000	Of course, the revival just came out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and it's pretty damn good.
5163000	5169000	You'll be able to now buy this on the iPhone or your whatever iOS device, iTouch, iPad.
5169000	5173000	We don't know exactly when, but it has been announced that you don't know Jack is coming out on these systems.
5173000	5178000	It kind of strikes me as a duh because, you know, you don't know Jack. It comes out on every system.
5178000	5180000	So I'm not surprised it's coming out on iOS as well.
5180000	5188000	Now, it's not going to support multiplayer, however. It will have Game Center support and it will have 20 full episodes.
5188000	5193000	Now, I don't know if these are 20 recycled episodes in the console games or 20 all new episodes.
5193000	5199000	I really hope it's all new. But yeah, the game is on its way at some point.
5199000	5205000	Battlefield 3, some people are very exciting about this and it's going to have a lot of ads.
5205000	5209000	I hope you like your ads in your game because Battlefield 3 is going to have a lot of them.
5209000	5214000	That's right because, let's see, John Riccitello, who of course is the Electronic Arts CEO,
5214000	5223000	he was talking to advertisers saying, quote, expect a couple hundred million dollars in marketing against, you know, the Call of Duty and so forth.
5223000	5225000	It's designed to take Call of Duty down.
5225000	5232000	Now, Riccitello said, kind of in a follow-up to that, that in-game advertising doesn't necessarily mean billboards.
5232000	5238000	Half of online multiplayer time is spent in lobbies and that's where folks are expecting advertising.
5238000	5241000	So you might be seeing ads in the lobbies, you should wait for games.
5241000	5247000	No, people are expecting advertising on TV, not on a multiplayer lobby.
5247000	5249000	That's kind of just an asshole thing to do.
5249000	5253000	So not only are there going to be ads on TV for the game, for them to try and beat Call of Duty,
5253000	5258000	but there's going to be plenty of ads in the game as well. That should be lots of fun.
5258000	5263000	Hey, Michael Jackson, the experience, the game that Loki's looking forward to next week on the Xbox 360,
5263000	5267000	it's already sold 3 million units globally because, you know, the game has been out on the Wii.
5267000	5271000	It's basically just dance, but it's all Michael Jackson songs.
5271000	5281000	Yeah, the Wii, the DS and PSP versions, they've sold 319,000 units in the UK, 11%, they said, of the global sales.
5281000	5284000	So that means it's sold about 3 million worldwide.
5284000	5287000	I'm not too surprised that this is probably sold a lot, especially in the US.
5287000	5289000	You know, people love their Michael Jackson.
5289000	5291000	So, there you go.
5291000	5294000	But so much for the music genre being dead.
5294000	5296000	Yeah, that's true, that's true.
5296000	5298000	Alright, DarkSakura.
5298000	5303000	Well, we definitely have other news.
5303000	5309000	Going into Rock Band, we have Fleetwood Mac and, of course, a solo member, Stevie Nicks.
5309000	5313000	This is the Fleetwood Mac slash Stevie Nicks Pack 1.
5313000	5317000	It has Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, Gold Dust Woman, Landslide, and Rhiannon.
5317000	5321000	And then from Stevie Nicks, there's Edge of Seventeen and Stand Back.
5321000	5330000	And it looks like Dreams and Edge of Seventeen both have Pro Guitar bass expansions available for another 99 cents.
5330000	5332000	God, I love Stevie Nicks. She's a fierce bitch.
5332000	5333000	She is.
5333000	5339000	And then, ooh, Silent Hill Revelation, which is gonna be the next movie based off of Silent Hill 3.
5339000	5345000	And Carrie-Anne Moss is gonna be in it as Claudia Wolf, who may or may not be evil.
5345000	5353000	And we also have in there Malcolm McDowell, who's going to be Leonard Wolf, who may or may not be evil.
5353000	5357000	Who knows? We've played the game we know.
5357000	5361000	And then Mass Effect 3 is not going to be multiplayer.
5361000	5365000	They may do multiplayer in later games, but not Mass Effect 3.
5365000	5367000	Confirmed Mass Effect 4.
5367000	5375000	They are going to expand the RPG elements with larger skill trees and different power evolutions.
5375000	5384000	And they are not going to make the weapons as customizable as they were, but they're going to have different behavioral changes and appearance changes.
5384000	5388000	And all weapons can be used by all classes.
5388000	5392000	So, cool. But not as cool.
5392000	5394000	Is it?
5394000	5395000	I don't know.
5395000	5398000	Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics.
5398000	5402000	Every week we invite you guys to tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.
5402000	5403000	Let's read some of the tweets tonight.
5403000	5407000	Defective Candy tweets us and says, forgot my MP3 player the other day.
5407000	5411000	Was so happy I remembered about OLR's Podlines.
5411000	5414000	Phone plus OLR equals awesome.
5414000	5416000	And I had to rack my brain for a minute after reading this tweet.
5416000	5419000	I was like, what the hell is Podlines?
5419000	5426000	And then I remembered, there's this service online called Podlines where apparently you can like call and listen to podcasts on the phone.
5426000	5429000	Like you don't even need an iPhone or whatever to do it.
5429000	5435000	So, I don't really officially endorse this site, but I guess it's kind of cool what they're doing.
5435000	5439000	Apparently you can call this number and, you know, I'm going to call it and see what happens actually right now.
5439000	5446000	You can call this number, it's area code 650, so please notice that is not an 800 number, so there is a charge with that.
5446000	5450000	It's area code 650-523-6855.
5450000	5455000	And this is from the website Podlines, L-I-N-E-Z dot com.
5455000	5458000	And let's see what happens when we give it a call.
5458000	5460000	Am I going to hear myself? I guess so.
5460000	5464000	New music from independent artists. Call song numbers radio.
5464000	5467000	Well, I don't know, I don't care about these independent artists.
5467000	5468000	Don't you hear me?
5468000	5469000	Quadruple zero.
5469000	5471000	I don't want to hear the ad, I want to hear me.
5471000	5479000	Wow, it's last week's show in really crappy quality.
5479000	5486000	Wow, it's last week's show.
5486000	5489000	You can listen on the phone, call on your cell phone.
5489000	5492000	Interesting.
5492000	5497000	I guess that's a neat idea for a service though, and obviously they're making money off those little ads in the beginning.
5497000	5500000	A lot of people have like damn limited minutes plan or, you know, stuff like that.
5500000	5503000	True, especially night time minutes like if you're working a graveyard shift.
5503000	5505000	Too cheap for an iPhone, there's a way to do it.
5505000	5510000	Alright, let's see. Ronnie Bailey is saying at OLR, listening to OLR.
5510000	5513000	I want an OLR autograph.
5513000	5515000	Okay, I've got a tissue, I've got a pen.
5515000	5521000	Alright, Ronnie Bailey just needs to DM us his address and we will autograph something and send it to him.
5521000	5523000	How about an empty CD case?
5523000	5525000	We'll find something. I might have something in.
5525000	5526000	There's my coffee cup.
5526000	5528000	You would give away your coffee cup?
5528000	5529000	It's in the trash can right now.
5529000	5530000	Oh, it's a Starbucks coffee cup.
5530000	5532000	Alright, we'll find something for Ronnie Bailey.
5532000	5533000	We'll find something that isn't trash.
5533000	5535000	DM us your address and we will send you something.
5535000	5536000	Yeah.
5536000	5539000	Alright, just because you asked.
5539000	5542000	And I don't want everybody else jumping in there and saying, I want free shit, I want free shit.
5542000	5545000	No, Ronnie Bailey gets it because he has it nicely first.
5545000	5549000	Alright, let's see. Tiger Claw says his tweet, oh I heard about this.
5549000	5552000	This is 1 versus 100. It's coming back y'all. 1 versus 100 is coming back.
5552000	5553000	Yay.
5553000	5555000	Not on Xbox Live though.
5555000	5556000	Boo.
5556000	5559000	1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
5559000	5561000	Double Boo.
5561000	5563000	Where's my fail horn for that one?
5563000	5567000	1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
5567000	5571000	I guess the version on Game Show Network didn't do too hot, just so you know.
5571000	5575000	It's being developed by iWin. It is being licensed by NML USA.
5575000	5578000	And it will be the mob versus the one structure.
5578000	5584000	Individual players will be inviting their friends to join the mob to answer questions.
5584000	5588000	And I guess either knock off them or the user. I don't really know how this works.
5588000	5591000	So there's also Facebook different modes there.
5591000	5595000	It will not just be the Xbox version ported. It's being remade by iWin.
5595000	5599000	But if you want to play 1 versus 100, I guess you'll have to go to Facebooks.
5599000	5604000	You can put that in between your farm and your Knights of the Clicky.
5604000	5608000	Another tweet from Tiger Claw 305.
5608000	5613000	Apparently Kojima has been teasing a new Snatcher game.
5613000	5619000	Didn't we have a rumor a couple weeks ago that Kojima was working on something new and didn't really say what it was yet?
5619000	5624000	Stop working on new stuff and finish the damn game that you have in progress.
5624000	5627000	Well hey, a new Snatcher game could be pretty cool.
5627000	5630000	So Snatcher was a text based adventure game.
5630000	5638000	I remember something about a year ago, maybe a few months ago, where folks were translating the second game in the series.
5638000	5644000	So yeah, Snatcher I guess has been dormant for a long time.
5644000	5652000	But I guess he tweeted something like, quote, I've readied a complete Snatcher set for some reason.
5652000	5656000	So I don't know, maybe people are taking that tweet very far.
5656000	5662000	And I also hate that Twitter is now becoming a respectable news source, but there you go.
5662000	5665000	Alright, anyhow, so that could be coming soon.
5665000	5670000	It would be kind of neat. I do remember the whole Kojima is working on something and maybe Snatcher would be it.
5670000	5674000	So we'll see.
5674000	5678000	Let's see, I guess ActDeft is tweeting us this.
5678000	5682000	Game Boy music video is exactly what it sounds like.
5682000	5687000	It's an article on Joystiq here that has a Game Boy, a bunch of Game Boys.
5687000	5693000	Let's see this.
5693000	5700000	Oh, see, the reason why you're hearing all these hammering sounds and things is somebody actually clicking their Game Boy
5700000	5704000	and putting headphones into the slot, getting that humming noise and things like that.
5704000	5708000	I was thinking it was actually going to be like chiptunes.
5708000	5713000	But no, this is somebody doing random things with an old-ass Game Boy.
5713000	5716000	That's pretty cool. It takes talent to put something like that together.
5716000	5718000	Neato.
5718000	5723000	Sonic has linked us to this. I believe this is also from Joystiq.
5723000	5728000	Except he just linked us to the picture. It has something to do with Child of Eden.
5728000	5730000	We didn't get actually linked to the article.
5730000	5735000	Yeah, Child of Eden seems cool. I'm actually really looking forward to that game.
5735000	5740000	Some folks that were playing it at PAX were really enjoying it too.
5740000	5748000	Remember, I don't know, they said it's going to support up to four controllers vibrating or something like that.
5748000	5750000	This is the corset, isn't it? Something about a corset.
5750000	5751000	Yes.
5751000	5756000	Oh, yes. I do remember reading about that. Awesome.
5756000	5759000	Let's get some more tweets. Gamer Girl tweets us saying,
5759000	5764000	Which do you think is better, Japanese versions of games or American versions of games?
5764000	5765000	That depends on the game.
5765000	5770000	Yeah, it's so wide open. It really depends on the game.
5770000	5774000	I mean, usually I like American versions of games because I can understand them,
5774000	5776000	because I don't speak Japanese.
5776000	5781000	But a lot of the old music games, especially back in the PlayStation 1 era, were way better in Japan.
5781000	5784000	Like, the Bust-A-Move series was better in Japan.
5784000	5787000	Most of the old DDR games were way better in Japan.
5787000	5790000	Like, DDR Third Mix on PlayStation 1 was the bomb.
5790000	5795000	But over here, we got, like, DDR USA Mix. Not so hot.
5795000	5798000	So yeah, it really depends on what game you're talking about.
5798000	5800000	So it's really wide open.
5800000	5804000	Blue Swim sends us some random tweets. I like these random tweets.
5804000	5810000	What was the first music album and first game soundtrack you bought?
5810000	5815000	The first game soundtrack I bought?
5815000	5817000	Uh...
5817000	5819000	That's a good question.
5819000	5825000	Ironically enough, it was probably DDR Third Mix for me.
5825000	5832000	Because, you know, I remember trying to get soundtracks online of, like, Final Fantasy VI,
5832000	5835000	and, like, the old school Final Fantasy games. Like, I was really into those musics.
5835000	5839000	But, you know, it was really hard to get music on CD back then over here.
5839000	5842000	So I would say you probably have to go back to when we first, you know,
5842000	5846000	were really starting to see more game soundtracks come out on CD in the CD gaming era.
5846000	5850000	And probably something like DDR Third Mix for me.
5850000	5854000	Well, I had, um, we had a bunch of, like, when I first moved in with Dan,
5854000	5857000	we had the TurboGrafx games that we could just, you know, play the CD.
5857000	5859000	Because they were Redbook Audio.
5859000	5864000	So, but, and I'll tell you what, actually I know the first one that I personally bought
5864000	5869000	that was not a bootleg.
5869000	5871000	Because, you know, we used to get those all the time.
5871000	5875000	And this was, like, me personally buying it with my own money by myself going out,
5875000	5878000	not people sending me copies or anything or all that.
5878000	5882000	Is, um, I went out and bought the Bust A Move soundtrack right when it came out.
5882000	5883000	Oh nice.
5883000	5887000	They had the screensaver and everything built in with it and all the cool stuff.
5887000	5893000	And then, I actually, that's the first one that I personally went out to buy.
5893000	5898000	I mean, we found other ones. We've been given other ones, you know.
5898000	5902000	But that was the one I went out first on a mission to get.
5902000	5906000	Others, you know, we just sort of looked into or found or, you know, said,
5906000	5908000	Oh, that's neat. Let's get it. You know.
5908000	5909000	Awesome.
5909000	5915000	And actually, there's been other, two others that I've bought the actual Japanese soundtracks for.
5915000	5920000	And that is Bust A Move 2, the dancing game, guys.
5920000	5923000	And Two Mix's Greatest Hits.
5923000	5924000	Nice.
5924000	5928000	Going to our chat room. I'm catching up on chat comments because I've been reading Twitter's.
5928000	5931000	SalaciousPop reminded me of something we saw the other day saying,
5931000	5934000	Zinga is now in the old Sega building in San Francisco.
5934000	5937000	True facts. Driving back from San Francisco the other day on Friday.
5937000	5940000	Driving by the old Sega building. You know, you'd see that.
5940000	5942000	Like, drive coming off 280, going back onto 80.
5942000	5945000	You drive by that old Sega building. Yeah, Zinga's in there now.
5945000	5946000	Doesn't that make you sad?
5946000	5947000	That's crazy sad.
5947000	5948000	That's very sad.
5948000	5951000	Sj100Matt in our chat room says, No offense, but F-Snatcher.
5951000	5953000	Zone of the Enders, please.
5953000	5955000	NacDeft follows up with that.
5955000	5959000	Where's my third Zone of the Enders, dammit?
5959000	5960000	Absolutely right.
5960000	5965000	Tigerclaw says, My first video game soundtrack, if you can call it that, is the Mortal Kombat CD.
5965000	5969000	And I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack, but the one by the Immortals.
5969000	5971000	Oh god, I forgot about that disc.
5971000	5974000	Oh yeah, I had that too. I did have that.
5974000	5977000	That might have been my first one too.
5977000	5978000	I did have that.
5978000	5981000	I had the movie soundtrack too. The movie soundtrack was so awesome.
5981000	5982000	It was sick!
5982000	5989000	I think my first soundtrack was Gran Turismo and then I remember DDR Fourth Mix.
5989000	5994000	This is the other one I bought. I bought that at a con.
5994000	5995000	Awesome.
5995000	5997000	Last tweet from Blue Swim.
5997000	6001000	If you could deep fry any candy bar, which one would it be?
6001000	6005000	Mmm, deep fried Milky Ways and Twix bars and Hershey's bars.
6005000	6008000	I've never had a deep fried candy bar, so I'm not sure how they taste.
6008000	6009000	I've had deep fried Snickers.
6009000	6010000	Is it good?
6010000	6012000	I could only eat half of it. It made me sick.
6012000	6014000	I know, it just sounds like too much.
6014000	6017000	I don't want any candy bar deep fried. I want them frozen.
6017000	6021000	I would say Almond Joy, because I like the Almond Joy a lot.
6021000	6024000	I like almond coconut stuff.
6024000	6031000	Not a big fan of candy bars, but if we got to pick something,
6031000	6036000	it's not really a candy bar, but it's what happens when you leave a bag of,
6036000	6039000	or I should say, let me correct this,
6039000	6043000	a three pound bag of gummy bears in your car during the hot summer.
6043000	6046000	It forms into a giant gummy pillow.
6046000	6047000	Mecha gummy.
6047000	6049000	Mecha gummy, if you will.
6049000	6056000	Sort of a Tetsuo gone crazy mecha gummy or ultra gummy.
6056000	6063000	Take that, bread that, and dip it in so you have a nice gooey pillow of fried gummy.
6063000	6065000	Oh god, that sounds terrible.
6065000	6069000	And it's extremely dangerous because you'd be hot molten inside.
6069000	6071000	You'd have to let that cool off a bit.
6071000	6073000	Oh my god.
6073000	6077000	One time I remember Alan got these little, they were like those strawberry candies.
6077000	6081000	You ever those little strawberry puffy, strawberry puffs I think they're called.
6081000	6085000	But they were like Hello Kitty brand and they were so good.
6085000	6087000	I want to deep fry those.
6087000	6088000	Deep fried Hello Kitty.
6088000	6091000	So much to deep fry nerds.
6091000	6093000	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.
6093000	6095000	Bread every single one of them.
6095000	6099000	That's right, we're getting way off topic, but twitter.com slash o-l-r.
6099000	6101000	Let's get back into some other gaming news.
6101000	6103000	Loki.
6103000	6109000	Speaking of abominations coming to Facebook.
6109000	6114000	GameStop has decided, hey you know what, Facebook people are there.
6114000	6118000	So we're going to put a storefront there and we're going to sell shit there.
6118000	6122000	Because, you know, that's what we do.
6122000	6128000	Honestly, and this kind of even goes back to just Facebook as it is.
6128000	6133000	Liking stuff, you have to understand what liking something means.
6133000	6136000	Liking something means you're going to get spammed by them.
6136000	6139000	So, not us of course, we don't spam a lot.
6139000	6141000	I don't think we post a lot on Facebook anyways.
6141000	6148000	But, you know, when it comes to companies, you can guarantee that they're going to be spamming you with a bunch of shit.
6148000	6155000	So, liking GameStop, you better believe that they're going to be letting you know, hey, hey, there's a game pre-booking.
6155000	6157000	You want to buy it?
6157000	6162000	Hey, hey, hey, listen, hey, maybe you should pre-order something.
6162000	6166000	You know, we got pre-orders. Come on in, pre-order things.
6166000	6170000	I hate going in there every time they're like, so what game are you looking forward to?
6170000	6173000	Because I know that's, so what game can I pre-order for you?
6173000	6174000	No.
6174000	6177000	And I tell them, I'm like, I'm not looking forward to anything.
6177000	6179000	I hate it all.
6179000	6182000	Why are you in here, dude?
6182000	6184000	Because I'm buying something to come out.
6184000	6192000	I'm really at that point where, yeah, I just like to go to Best Buy or Fry's or some huge store that happens to have video games.
6192000	6194000	You know what I mean?
6194000	6197000	Unless it's like some collector's edition that's super exclusive.
6197000	6199000	You do not need to pre-order anything.
6199000	6201000	You can find them in stores.
6201000	6206000	It's just like, you know, oh, you better pre-order that 3DS because you'll never be able to find it.
6206000	6208000	No, they're all over the fucking place.
6208000	6212000	It's just, just wait.
6212000	6214000	Be a little patient.
6214000	6219000	I know that sounds really ridiculous coming from me, but seriously.
6219000	6224000	You, mister, I'm gonna pay 200 bucks for Motorstorm Apocalypse?
6224000	6225000	No.
6225000	6226000	Be patient?
6226000	6229000	No.
6229000	6230000	Huh?
6230000	6232000	It's a collector's item, okay?
6232000	6233000	Mm-hmm.
6233000	6237000	Mister, I'm gonna import my 3DS.
6237000	6238000	You know what?
6238000	6239000	I actually-
6239000	6240000	I sold that, okay?
6240000	6241000	Oh, okay.
6241000	6242000	Did you make your money back?
6242000	6243000	Yes.
6243000	6244000	Wow, nice.
6244000	6246000	So, I would say that that was awesome.
6246000	6249000	It was like renting a 3DS for a month.
6249000	6252000	Yeah, it worked out.
6252000	6257000	But yeah, I mean, so yeah, it's not a big surprise.
6257000	6261000	And of course, you know, they recently acquired Impulse and Spawn Labs.
6261000	6270000	So, they're trying to make, I guess, as much of, make themselves as much in your face as possible.
6270000	6279000	And I guess, yeah, you'll be able to purchase, reserve titles, view trailers, screenshots, and all that stuff.
6279000	6281000	So, yeah.
6281000	6282000	Alright.
6282000	6285000	Well, Atari games are new all over again.
6285000	6291000	It seems like we have a story like this every year, because Atari games always seem to get re-released for some freaking console.
6291000	6296000	And this week, it's the iOS systems, the iPhone, the iPad, and so forth.
6296000	6299000	Atari's Greatest Hits was released this week.
6299000	6303000	And apparently, 100 games are available through this.
6303000	6305000	Here's the deal.
6305000	6309000	You get a free shell of the game that comes with Pong for free just for downloading it,
6309000	6314000	which obviously is one of the big Atari games ever, although it hasn't aged well at all.
6314000	6321000	But you can pick up a variety of edition packs for 99 cents each.
6321000	6324000	And you can get extra games that come with them.
6324000	6329000	You can just buy all 100 freaking games for $14.99 if you want the old games.
6329000	6335000	Some of the games you can get, Tempest, Crystal Castles, Yars Revenge, Combat, and so forth.
6335000	6340000	Now, usually you kind of look at this and go, great, yay, it's the same thing all over again.
6340000	6346000	But one of the cool things that it does have, you can do multiplayer over Bluetooth connections.
6346000	6347000	So that's kind of cool.
6347000	6349000	For some games.
6349000	6350000	Yeah, not everything.
6350000	6353000	But for some of the games, it has multiplayer over Bluetooth.
6353000	6354000	So that's kind of cool.
6354000	6357000	It's already more useful than Game Room.
6357000	6359000	Sad.
6359000	6365000	Game Room could have been so good, but it's dead now.
6365000	6370000	They haven't officially canceled Game Room, but they also haven't put anything out for it since the end of last year.
6370000	6372000	It's left as a graveyard.
6372000	6377000	I know. Sad face.
6377000	6380000	Well, how about something that's a little bit less than sad?
6380000	6381000	Okay.
6381000	6382000	Is it my turn?
6382000	6387000	Streets of Rage, also known as Bare Knuckle.
6387000	6389000	It's getting a remake after eight years.
6389000	6394000	And it's, well, it was actually started by Bomber Games.
6394000	6398000	They started doing something called Streets of Rage remake in 2003.
6398000	6402000	And now they put out the final version as freeware on PC.
6402000	6407000	So maybe Sega's not upset about that.
6407000	6412000	But it's really not so much of a remake as much as a new game.
6412000	6422000	It's using new code, has 103 stages, and playable characters from 1, 2, and 3 with new abilities and new characters.
6422000	6429000	There's new enemies based off of the Game Gear ones and cover illustrations are added on there.
6429000	6437000	There is boss rush, volleyball, AI partner mode, and other modes and a level editor.
6437000	6443000	So I'm watching a little bit of this and it just looks pretty neat.
6443000	6448000	There's a scene where you're outrunning a bulldozer and you have to fight walls.
6448000	6451000	And you can actually fight the bulldozer too.
6451000	6453000	That's pretty funny.
6453000	6455000	I want to fight a bulldozer, but not really.
6455000	6460000	You just kick the bulldozer and it goes backwards and then you go back to kicking the wall some more.
6460000	6462000	And then the bulldozer knocks you over.
6462000	6464000	Man vs. Bulldozer.
6464000	6466000	Film 11.
6466000	6468000	Awesome.
6468000	6469000	Kind of cool.
6469000	6472000	Damn those knee-high walls.
6472000	6475000	Oh, he's getting my way.
6475000	6478000	Someone driving a bulldozer through a building is what I want to know.
6478000	6480000	I guess I'll have to play the game to find out.
6480000	6483000	Oh, I remembered a game I did play this week because it was on sale.
6483000	6484000	It was the X-Men arcade game.
6484000	6486000	I don't think I talked about this last week.
6486000	6487000	No, go ahead.
6487000	6489000	Yeah, the X-Men arcade game.
6489000	6491000	You know, better in my memories.
6491000	6494000	As sadly a lot of the retro classics end up being.
6494000	6495000	Not all of them though.
6495000	6497000	Pitfall 2, still as awesome as I remember.
6497000	6498000	Just saying.
6498000	6501000	But some of the games were better in my memory.
6501000	6502000	Anyhow.
6502000	6507000	I'm kind of, well, actually I'm not too excited about Mortal Kombat.
6507000	6512000	But it is neat to see that there's some stuff coming to the 360 since the PlayStation 3 version
6512000	6514000	does get, you know, Kratos.
6514000	6519000	The 360 though, and this is all considered to be rumor, although they do have some screenshots
6519000	6522000	that kind of confirm that.
6522000	6529000	It's supposed to be getting some exclusives, including a puzzle combat mode.
6529000	6534000	Also, a King of the Hill mode, which I guess will feature Avatar support.
6534000	6537000	How that works is beyond me.
6537000	6543000	Also, an arena called the Pit 360, which is a remake of Mortal Kombat 3's The Pit 3.
6543000	6548000	And additionally, I guess they're saying that the DLC character Lady in Red will be offered
6548000	6552000	as a free download for Xbox Live users for a limited time.
6552000	6560000	Also, Mortal Kombat themed Avatar gear available for purchase on Xbox Live as well.
6560000	6564000	No confirmation on everything, but there are some screenshots that kind of show, you know,
6564000	6568000	the Pit and these Avatars watching the fight.
6568000	6571000	So it's a little interesting, I guess.
6571000	6578000	And then on top of that, you may remember the Mortal Kombat kind of pitch for, you know,
6578000	6584000	a new reimagining of the movie series, which I really wish would have happened, but it didn't.
6584000	6588000	But instead it became this now web series that's going to be going on.
6588000	6592000	And apparently the premiere of this web series is going to be on the 12th.
6592000	6594000	That's right, on Tuesday.
6594000	6600000	And you can check it out, the first episode of that, including, you know,
6600000	6603000	Michael Jai White's supposed to be in that still.
6603000	6608000	And it's going to have eight episodes, I guess, leading up to the April 19th launch day.
6608000	6612000	And yeah, you can check that out.
6612000	6616000	It's going to be on Makima.com at 4 p.m.
6616000	6618000	It's probably going to be really gross.
6618000	6620000	I should show it to my mom so she can watch it.
6620000	6623000	This is gross, Rob. What are you making me watch? This is sick.
6623000	6626000	I think I would definitely want to check it out. It looked pretty cool.
6626000	6628000	Yeah, it does look pretty cool.
6628000	6632000	Again, can't explain it. I hate the Saw movies, yet I love Mortal Kombat even when it's gross.
6632000	6636000	But there'll probably be nothing as over-the-top as what you see in the game in these movies.
6636000	6637000	No.
6637000	6640000	I don't think I'm going to see Melina eating, like, ripping off someone's face and eating their tongue
6640000	6642000	and then spiking the head on the ground.
6642000	6643000	That'd be awesome.
6643000	6646000	I did get to see the subway fatality.
6646000	6647000	Oh yeah?
6647000	6648000	That's awesome.
6648000	6653000	It's like he holds her head on the subway so that their heads go through all the windows.
6653000	6654000	Oh yeah.
6654000	6656000	And then he throws them in front of another train. It's awesome.
6656000	6662000	You know what they should have done, which have been kind of fun as a parody of some of the other fighting game series?
6662000	6668000	Do Mortal Kombat Xtreme Beach Volleyball and actually have that where they take someone's head and spike it on the ground
6668000	6672000	and make it really ridiculously bloody.
6672000	6675000	Let's see. Let me look at this here real quick. Let's see if this is it.
6675000	6677000	Here we go. Here we go.
6677000	6682000	There you go.
6682000	6685000	And there it goes. Oncoming train.
6685000	6688000	That's awesome.
6688000	6693000	They showed a lot of... What I was looking at was the x-ray vision in the moves.
6693000	6696000	Yeah, those are like the special moves that you can do. It's pretty cool.
6696000	6700000	I don't know. I didn't like the demo at first, but it really started growing on me.
6700000	6703000	And I think the final game is going to do that too. So we'll see.
6703000	6707000	I'm going to definitely check that out when it comes out. Very cool.
6707000	6711000	Portal news. Because Portal 2 is on the way.
6711000	6715000	I was really shocked to see that this game is literally around the corner.
6715000	6719000	Speaking of this whole driving through San Francisco thing, they have a lot of video game billboards in San Francisco.
6719000	6723000	I don't know if you know this. I saw a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 billboard.
6723000	6727000	I saw a Super Street Fighter 3D... Super Street... Excuse me.
6727000	6730000	Street Fighter 4 3D.
6730000	6732000	Super Street Fighter 4 3D.
6732000	6735000	Damn it. Whatever the fuck that game is. I saw a billboard for that too.
6735000	6739000	And then I saw a billboard for Portal 2 and it said the release date was April 9th.
6739000	6742000	And I kind of did that... Oh, holy shit. Or April 19th, excuse me.
6742000	6745000	I kind of did that whole, holy shit, that game is coming out really soon.
6745000	6747000	So I guess the billboard accomplished what it's supposed to do.
6747000	6750000	My birthday is April 19th, everybody.
6750000	6756000	Well, anyhow, to wrap up for your birthday dark soccer in anticipation of Portal 2,
6756000	6760000	there is a comic that's out now. Portal 2 Lab Rat.
6760000	6762000	That's right. It's a comic that you can read through.
6762000	6768000	It's on IGN Comics at comics.ign.com and you can check that out.
6768000	6770000	It's a free comic, so if you want to read that.
6770000	6772000	Maybe that's something you can talk about on Comic Insanity.
6772000	6776000	I don't know if you do the whole virtual comics, but Portal 2 might be a good excuse.
6776000	6777000	Yeah.
6777000	6784000	Also of note, Joko, Jonathan Coulton, of course doing the music for Portal 2, I believe.
6784000	6786000	He's contributing to that as well, right?
6786000	6788000	Didn't I use something? He's doing some of that.
6788000	6794000	Well, there is a new version of Portals Still Alive that's going to be coming out.
6794000	6800000	I don't know if this is with regards to Portal 2 or what, but this is coming out through Twitter.
6800000	6808000	I guess it's Jonathan Coulton and They Might Be Giants because John Flassenburg from They Might Be Giants,
6808000	6811000	he's producing Jonathan Coulton's upcoming album.
6811000	6815000	And I guess one of the tracks they're doing for this album is a new version of Still Alive.
6815000	6820000	And it's going to feature Sarah Quinn. She's from Tegan and Sarah, so she'll be in this new one.
6820000	6822000	That's pretty cool. I really like Tegan and Sarah.
6822000	6825000	They do a great live show because they like to tell stories.
6825000	6829000	I like going to concerts where they actually talk and interact with the audience.
6829000	6831000	And Tegan and Sarah do this better than anyone else I've seen.
6831000	6837000	Like Britney Spears, I don't get her concerts because all she does, she just comes out from the stage,
6837000	6839000	parades around and lip syncs for two hours.
6839000	6842000	She might say, hey, Sacramento, and then that's it.
6842000	6844000	She parades back to her five-star hotel.
6844000	6846000	There's something else super cool in this, Rob.
6846000	6847000	What else do you want to say?
6847000	6848000	Theremin!
6848000	6850000	That's right. There's a Theremin solo on the new album.
6850000	6852000	Woo! Theremin!
6852000	6856000	Unfortunately, the new album isn't due out until 2013.
6856000	6858000	So this will be a little bit of a wait.
6858000	6861000	So I guess maybe this new track isn't for Portal 2.
6861000	6863000	Sad face.
6863000	6866000	I'm sure there'll be some new song from the game, though. Everybody's all crazy. Over.
6866000	6869000	Theremin!
6869000	6870000	Awesome.
6870000	6876000	Maybe something with Cave Johnson singing the new character that's in the game.
6876000	6880000	The CEO of Aperture Science or something like that.
6880000	6885000	Which, by the way, speaking of your rant earlier, did you notice there's some bonus from getting it at GameStop?
6885000	6887000	There's some unlockable character.
6887000	6892000	Yeah, no, I've seen the commercials. It's not even an unlockable character. It's a skin for your character.
6892000	6899000	Seriously, people, if you're all getting raging boners over a fucking skin, I'm sorry.
6899000	6903000	But the pre-order bonuses for stuff nowadays are really kind of terrible.
6903000	6909000	Like, you know, oh, you get this. Instead of the gun being silver, it's gold now.
6909000	6911000	Whoa!
6911000	6915000	Gold. That way all my friends know I'm a consumer whore.
6915000	6917000	It's an E-peen something. I have something you don't have.
6917000	6922000	No, it's not something that you don't have, because everybody's ordering at the same place, so they're all gonna have it.
6922000	6925000	Okay, so I was watching South Park the other day randomly.
6925000	6928000	It was on TV, and there was a commercial for the new Mortal Kombat.
6928000	6935000	And it was a commercial for people at GameStop to get the new Mortal Kombat because you get the Scorpion skin, the classic Scorpion skin with it.
6935000	6938000	And they did this whole Mashima thing with it, which was kind of funny.
6938000	6940000	Yeah, they've been doing that now.
6940000	6946000	But what I thought was interesting about it is that Mileena was not wearing the costume that she has in the demo.
6946000	6949000	She was wearing classic Mileena outfits.
6949000	6953000	So classic Scorpion outfit is not gonna be the only classic outfit that shows up in the game.
6953000	6955000	Yes, there's a ton of them.
6955000	6957000	Are they all gonna be download content, though?
6957000	6963000	No, some of them I think actually came with the... I think some come with the game.
6963000	6966000	Like, there may be, like, a code to download one of them.
6966000	6971000	But they're gonna be offered later on as, you know, from what I've seen in places.
6971000	6972000	That's cool, yes.
6972000	6974000	Yes, there's plenty of skins coming.
6974000	6979000	But the new Mileena shows way more boobies than the old one did.
6979000	6983000	And with all the gross stuff that goes on in the game, she's, like, smearing blood on her boobies.
6983000	6988000	That's gross, but funny. That's Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat is funny.
6988000	6991000	Speaking of hilarious, let's go to the email bag.
6991000	6993000	Every week, you guys send us emails.
6993000	6997000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and the hilarity ensues.
6997000	7000000	DarkSakura, stop shopping on Steam.
7000000	7002000	I'm not stopping.
7002000	7004000	I'll never stop.
7004000	7006000	I'll never stop shopping.
7006000	7008000	Shopping's actually good for you. Did you know that?
7008000	7009000	It's very therapeutic.
7009000	7010000	No, it's not.
7010000	7014000	Whenever I get pissed off, I go to the outlets. It's been $300. I feel much better.
7014000	7016000	First email.
7016000	7019000	It says, hello, O.L.R. Great show.
7019000	7021000	I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the following.
7021000	7024000	The Streets of Rage remake project.
7024000	7026000	Yeah, we just covered this.
7026000	7029000	It is an 8-year-old fan project by some very talented guys from Spain.
7029000	7033000	The graphics are all redrawn, levels were upgraded or extended, and music got remixed.
7033000	7036000	The remake is free. I'm not affiliated with these people.
7036000	7040000	But he sent the link to it, so I figured I would link it in the chatroom.
7040000	7042000	Thank you, Carlos.
7042000	7047000	Well, there you go. Another endorsement for that project that folks have been eagerly anticipating.
7047000	7050000	Yep. And I just linked it.
7050000	7054000	So, we only got one other email.
7054000	7058000	Hi, O.L.R. I think this is from Spazinator.
7058000	7062000	Since he's banned from Twitter, he's turned to the email bag.
7062000	7069000	I just wanted to point out a couple of relatively minor stories for the three of you.
7069000	7075000	First, there are four new free TV shows, all of which are available on both PSN as well as Xbox Live's Zune Marketplace.
7075000	7079000	Finding them is just a matter of looking under the free TV tabs on their respective systems.
7079000	7085000	The second story, or should I say non-story, I don't know, is that the PlayStation Network has been relatively severe-
7085000	7091000	was having relatively severe issues this past Tuesday, while Sony has indeed acknowledged that there was an issue
7091000	7094000	by issuing a statement via the U.S. PlayStation blog.
7094000	7097000	They have remained rather tight-lipped about the cause of the issue.
7097000	7103000	However, it's commonly believed that the issues with PSN were caused by a DDoS attack by a group called Anonymous, which we covered.
7103000	7110000	I don't think that's- well, you know, to be fair, these emails come in during the week, but I don't think it's really, like, rumor.
7110000	7113000	I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed. They did it. They took credit.
7113000	7117000	Supposedly they're upset over the fact that Sony is taking GeoHot to court. Yes.
7117000	7121000	If I know Loki as well as I think I do, I'll beat him to the proverbial punch and say this,
7121000	7128000	Somebody call the WAM-bulance. Oh no, Sony is protecting their interest in suing a hacker. Waaah, I show them.
7128000	7133000	Okay, that wasn't quite a Loki rant, but it was a reasonable approximation. I don't think so.
7133000	7141000	Uh, well, there's a problem with your argument, the problem being that he's not- he's hacking hardware that he owns.
7141000	7150000	He's basically, you know, allowing himself to be able to run Linux again, or allowing himself to, you know, hack stuff.
7150000	7156000	He's not hacking the PlayStation Network. It would be like, for example, I guess you could use the same argument that,
7156000	7166000	Say you made a custom wallpaper or something like that for your Xbox 360, and then you popped it, you, you know, hacked it into your system so that you have a custom wallpaper,
7166000	7173000	And then Sony- or Microsoft comes and sues you because you did that. It's basically that. The whole argument is that,
7173000	7181000	Sony's coming after him for hacking his own hardware that he had, because they're saying that they own the system still.
7181000	7190000	Yeah. Um, to continue, side note, I have no way to verify this either way, but supposedly anonymous has issued a statement,
7190000	7198000	Which I will paraphrase. We wholeheartedly believe in Geohot's cause and believe he is unjustly be persecuted.
7198000	7203000	We will fight for you until Sony relents. We will never give you up. We will never let you down. We will never run around and desert you.
7203000	7210000	Okay, last part was BS. That was a variation of a 4chan joke, where a discussion morphs from one topic to quoting Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,
7210000	7217000	Just that I submitted Rick Astley for Fresh Prince. This email was brought to you by Old Ass Jokes. That's it.
7217000	7225000	Alright. That does it for emails. Unfortunately, both about topics we already covered on the show tonight,
7225000	7230000	But hey, it's where every gamer has a voice, so send in your voices. Chances are though, if it's a big news story,
7230000	7234000	We're probably gonna hit it at some point. You know, it is a 3 hour show. Just for the record.
7234000	7239000	So if you're gonna email us, and that's okay, don't let that discourage you from emailing us about a big topic, a news story,
7239000	7243000	But just tell us, what are your thoughts? Are you excited? Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you mad?
7243000	7250000	You know, tell us what you think about it. Alright. Let's see. Let's go on to the FUs of the week.
7250000	7253000	Every week we like to get angsty. So let's do that right now.
7253000	7277000	FU to my semi OCD habit of every time I get a harebrained idea, I research the crap out of it to make sure it's possible.
7277000	7289000	And then probably don't end up doing it. This I will do. It will be done. And also an FU to lack of communication. Done.
7289000	7308000	I hate doing this. I'm so sad about it. But FU to the squeeze in. And the reason why is because I've been looking forward to for years trying to squeeze with cheese,
7308000	7315000	And just, you know, it looks so delicious on TV and stuff like that. I finally went to the one that they just put in in Roseville.
7315000	7328000	And I gotta say, that burger was fucking terrible. The cheese tasted awful. The burger had no flavor to it. It was kind of burnt tasting, the cheese.
7328000	7338000	It was like basically having the most beautiful woman that you've ever seen describe how she's just going to make you, and you would be a virgin of course,
7338000	7345000	Have the most amazing orgasm possible, and basically describing in great detail what she's going to do.
7345000	7346000	Good luck with that, Hunter.
7346000	7355000	Has you close your eyes, and then you get knocked out, left in the desert to die without any legs. That's basically what this was about.
7355000	7362000	It's like, huh, I wasn't expecting that. That's basically, uh, Smash, or not Smash Bros.
7362000	7365000	Oops, why is the outro to the show playing? My bad.
7365000	7371000	It's basically, I mean, it was such a disappointment. I don't understand the draw to it at all.
7371000	7377000	Maybe it was a bad burr or something, but, you know, everybody else seemed happy about it.
7377000	7386000	I could do better myself, man. I mean, if all it is is putting a lot of cheese on something. Fuck, dude, I can put a lot of cheese on something.
7386000	7397000	Uh, my FU of the Week, wait, where'd the FU music go? There we go, thank you. Uh, my FU of the Week would go to, um, probably moving.
7397000	7403000	I mean, like, don't get me wrong, I'm really happy to be moving, and the new place has so much more space than my old place did, so that's really good.
7403000	7410000	Because I have a lot of shit, but my FU goes to having to move that shit is really a pain in the big fat ass.
7410000	7412000	You still have to move far.
7412000	7418000	Yeah, but it's, you still have to load up a truck and take it to the other end of the complex, so, it's not that bad.
7418000	7424000	It's just that you have to clean the old place, and that's just a pain. It's a pain, and I'm lazy.
7424000	7425000	Close it with fire.
7425000	7431000	Lazy people don't like moving. I'm gonna do what I did next time I'm hiring movers again.
7431000	7438000	When I hired movers last time, it was great. Except for the whole stuff that they weren't able to move, but, anyhow.
7438000	7446000	Let's move on, shall we? Couple more news stories for you guys, and then, oh god, it's the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7446000	7455000	Uh, yes, another week, another class action lawsuit. This time, it's towards EA, and I could've sworn that this hasn't been the first one, but,
7455000	7464000	apparently there is the, um, Madden lawsuit, and it's, um, this time, it's not even necessarily just Madden, but it's EA Sports.
7464000	7475000	Madden NCAA and Arena Football. Um, apparently that there is a case, uh, Pickover vs. Electronic Arts, Inc.
7475000	7481000	saying that EA's exclusive licenses foreclosed competition in an alleged football video game market.
7481000	7487000	Because of the lack of competition, the plaintiffs in the case claimed that this monopoly allowed EA to overcharge for its games,
7487000	7492000	even though EA Sports games, of course, cost as much as, you know, all the other console games out there.
7492000	7504000	Um, so, if you're interested in possibly participating in this, you can go to easportslitigation.com, and check out the information regarding that.
7504000	7512000	Apparently, this would qualify if you bought a game between, or an EA Sports football game, uh, between 2005 and now.
7512000	7522000	Yeah, XLink was telling me about this, because I guess he got an email about it on WoW, and there was a part of me that was kind of like,
7522000	7524000	is this like a phishing thing, or is this, now I guess it is a real deal.
7524000	7525000	No, it's real.
7525000	7526000	Class action lawsuit.
7526000	7533000	You know, they give the options, you know, you can remain a class member, and it says you need, you do not need to take any further action at this time,
7533000	7540000	you'll automatically remain a class member, and, uh, or you can exclude yourself, and do all that stuff.
7540000	7547000	It's, I've seen this a lot, like, I got one from 24 Hour Fitness one time, and I got like, it was crap, it was like,
7547000	7550000	ooh, you get three weeks free, it's like, I don't want to go back there.
7550000	7552000	Whoops, excuse me.
7552000	7558000	I'm having a lot of technical fail tonight, I apologize for that.
7558000	7563000	Well, I'm surprised, Rob, this episode's supposed to be squeaky clean.
7563000	7566000	I know, it's 4-9, it's really broken and dirty.
7566000	7569000	Alright, well since I already played a part of it, let me play it here.
7569000	7574000	I had no idea this was, uh, in the DVD, is this in the Tron Legacy DVD?
7574000	7581000	There's an ad for the new Commodore 64, I guess, that is coming out, because it's this whole Tron thing,
7581000	7588000	it talks about, you know, more colors and better sound and so forth, and then all of a sudden...
7588000	7590000	I didn't see that.
7590000	7593000	And we watched, like, a bunch of stuff.
7593000	7597000	And there's a whole Commodore computer coming out.
7597000	7603000	Now, we talked about this on the show before, that the Commodore 64 is being rebooted.
7603000	7606000	Maybe that was something special they did for you, I don't know.
7606000	7608000	It's probably like a TV commercial or something.
7608000	7610000	Perhaps, but this is still awesome.
7610000	7612000	CommodoreUSA.net, if you want to get it.
7612000	7614000	They are Commodore PCs.
7614000	7618000	The Commodore 64, the pricing is announced, that's what's made these big.
7618000	7621000	The Commodore 64 is going to start at $595 US dollars,
7621000	7628000	the VIC Pro will be $895 US dollars, and the VIC Slim will be $395 US dollars.
7628000	7631000	Now, it doesn't quite say exactly what all is coming with these.
7631000	7633000	Let me see if the website has more details on this.
7633000	7638000	It's an Intel Atom processor, so think Netbook.
7638000	7641000	Aw, that kind of sucks, if that's the case.
7641000	7643000	Okay, yay, you're showing me the damn preview again.
7643000	7645000	Let me see here, let me go to the site.
7645000	7652000	Think Netbook and think, you know, it's going to have an emulator for Commodore games on there.
7652000	7657000	Let's see, the classic recreated Commodore 64, one 12 volt DC jack,
7657000	7664000	one PS2 keyboard mouse connectors, one HDMI, one DVI-D, one VGA, four USB slots.
7664000	7666000	Go to the tech configurations.
7666000	7671000	Let's see, technology, processor, Intel Atom, oh boy.
7671000	7673000	What's 1.8 gigahertz?
7673000	7678000	I can guarantee you right there, those boards, because they're all integrated boards,
7678000	7683000	they go for about maybe $200 at the most.
7683000	7686000	That sucks, because I'll tell you what, I'm not even going to lie,
7686000	7689000	I really want one of these, because I love my Commodore 64,
7689000	7692000	and this is what they're selling it on to.
7692000	7694000	You can seriously build one of those cheaper than that.
7694000	7696000	I know, I know.
7696000	7702000	Yeah, the Realtek audio that's built in, the Ethernet's all built into the stupid board.
7702000	7709000	Do they even include anything else other than how much RAM was in it again?
7709000	7713000	Two DDR2s up to four gigs.
7713000	7716000	Two single channel slots, yeah.
7716000	7722000	DDR2, old slow ass RAM compared to nowadays stuff.
7722000	7727000	Let me see what's in that VIC Pro, because I guess there's the VIC Pro that's coming out as well.
7727000	7729000	See, but this doesn't have that same nostalgia factor for me.
7729000	7734000	See, that's a little bit different though. See, this one actually has a dual or quad core processor built into it.
7734000	7737000	So, that's a little bit better.
7737000	7739000	Intel dual or quad.
7739000	7743000	How big was the Commodore 64 keyboard? Was that pretty big?
7743000	7747000	Well, they were monsters because the computer was inside the keyboard.
7747000	7749000	So they were pretty big keyboards.
7749000	7752000	I don't understand why they can't fit a bigger, better computer in there.
7752000	7754000	Well, it's probably the price.
7754000	7758000	They're trying to, obviously they want to profit off these.
7758000	7762000	Yeah, but I mean, hell, when I was building my MAME cabinet stuff,
7762000	7765000	I mean, they're like dual core Intel chips.
7765000	7773000	It's like dual core 2.8 gigahertz chips with 2 gigs of RAM and decent hard drive and stuff.
7773000	7775000	And I built those under $200.
7775000	7778000	So, they can't do that?
7778000	7783000	I mean, and that's, you know, hell, you could probably find that stuff even cheaper.
7783000	7789000	Especially if you're like Commodore or somebody making a massive amount of computers.
7789000	7793000	I mean, you're not just a consumer like myself.
7793000	7795000	I don't know.
7795000	7798000	But, yeah, whatever. You're paying for nostalgia.
7798000	7801000	Maybe licensing for Commodore.
7801000	7802000	Alright.
7802000	7805000	Maybe having to remake those computers.
7805000	7807000	Well, probably it's nostalgia.
7807000	7809000	It's the original emulator.
7809000	7811000	They're trying to get some value out of that too.
7811000	7813000	You know, obviously they want to make a profit off it,
7813000	7822000	but they want to cash in on old folks like me who have the nostalgia going with the Commodore 64.
7822000	7823000	That's what it is.
7823000	7824000	Alright, let's go to the Skype line.
7824000	7826000	Every week we open up the Skype line.
7826000	7832000	Take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7832000	7834000	The Skype line is open now.
7834000	7837000	We're going to have to wait a minute and a half for the chat room to hear that.
7837000	7840000	Well, we could also post in the chat room.
7840000	7841000	I'm going to do that right now.
7841000	7842000	Send call now.
7842000	7843000	Yeah.
7843000	7846000	Loki, go ahead and read us some last minute stories while I post that.
7846000	7850000	Sony has thought of a great idea for the PlayStation Move.
7850000	7852000	Hey, you know what sells more Move?
7852000	7853000	More iPad.
7853000	7854000	That's right.
7854000	7857000	There's an iPad sequel coming out because, you know, the first one wasn't terrible enough.
7857000	7861000	So this iPad sequel comes with Friends.
7861000	7865000	That's where you'll be able to have two players and two iPads at the same time.
7865000	7868000	You can be able to create your own content as well.
7868000	7873000	They're saying that, I guess, you can either raise one up by itself or raise them as a pair.
7873000	7875000	I mean, I'm sorry.
7875000	7881000	It was a neat idea at first when it was supposed to be for the PlayStation Eye, but it was pretty terrible when it came out.
7881000	7885000	I can't be too excited about that, unfortunately.
7885000	7888000	And then this is kind of interesting.
7888000	7894000	Remember how the PlayStation 1 emulator got removed from the Android Marketplace?
7894000	7897000	Well, not to be outdone by that.
7897000	7905000	The PSX for Droid application is back, and actually it's available now from the developer's website.
7905000	7912000	It says the original Sony complaint only had to do with the trademark logo that he had put on the app's icon.
7912000	7922000	But since then, I guess, Google has closed both his Android Market and Checkout accounts, so he's leaving him unable to publish any apps.
7922000	7924000	So he's self-publishing the app now.
7924000	7935000	So if you want to download the free app and then go find your ISOs, you can do that and avoid paying $7 per PlayStation 1 game.
7935000	7938000	God, I love that stuff.
7938000	7940000	And then finally, this is kind of cool.
7940000	7944000	Well, Evil Dead, they're making a game now for the iPhone and iPad.
7944000	7948000	It's going to be a 3D action shooter.
7948000	7955000	It's supposed to be coming out very soon, and it kind of features these chibi characters.
7955000	7969000	Chibi, Bruce Campbell, and it's supposed to be out for, I guess, $2.99 on the iPhone, $4.99 on the iPad, and 30 chapters, and I guess lots of stuff.
7969000	7973000	It looked like the movie, but very chibi.
7973000	7987000	And then I guess it's being developed by Trigger Apps, who's made a bunch of different movie-based games for the iPhone and Android, including The Karate Kid, Green Hornet, G.I. Joe, and Couples Retreat.
7987000	7990000	That Couples Retreat looked like a terrible movie.
7990000	7991000	No, it looks really terrible.
7991000	7992000	What's that?
7992000	7993000	The Guvenator.
7993000	7995000	Oh, God.
7995000	7996000	Seriously.
7996000	7999000	I saw you post that story, and I was like, no, we're not covering that.
7999000	8001000	I guess we are now, but that's alright.
8001000	8003000	It looks so terrible.
8003000	8005000	Why would you, why would they do this?
8005000	8007000	Apparently, Stan Lee is putting out a comic.
8007000	8011000	I guess Stan Lee has no cred anymore, because he's putting out the Guvenator now.
8011000	8013000	Way to ruin your reputation there, bud.
8013000	8023000	So they put out a comic, and of course they're doing a cartoon series, and apparently that cartoon series is going to become a movie, and possibly a game.
8023000	8029000	And Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing The Voice, and I don't get it.
8029000	8030000	It looks stupid.
8030000	8032000	It looks so cheesy.
8032000	8036000	But that's what they're doing.
8036000	8039000	That's the best idea.
8039000	8045000	Gosh, our Skype line is really lagged tonight, and it's making me sad, but we're talking in the chat room about Commodore 64.
8045000	8052000	Because Ziba in our chat room is saying, you know, it just emulates the games, and there's nothing like having an original Commodore 64 play the games.
8052000	8053000	I'm like, you know what, you're right.
8053000	8056000	I need to just go find an original Commodore 64 that still works.
8056000	8058000	There might be one in my parents' garage, actually.
8058000	8060000	I don't know if the damn thing would still work.
8060000	8064000	But yeah, it just had me reminiscing.
8064000	8069000	Seriously, I want to go back and play Dragon's Lair 2 on the Commodore 64 so bad.
8069000	8072000	It's one of my favorite soundtracks ever, and I know I've brought this up on the show before.
8072000	8076000	But it was not the actual Dragon's Lair 2 that was the arcade game.
8076000	8078000	This was called Escape from Singe's Castle.
8078000	8085000	I think I brought this up when Dark Sakura did this as the classic game of the week once, but one of my favorite soundtracks ever on the Commodore 64.
8085000	8089000	It was Escape from Singe's Castle. It was like the second half of the scenes.
8089000	8096000	But the thing about the Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair is that it wasn't, like they couldn't make the laserdisc, obviously.
8096000	8100000	So they had to make little mini-games out of all the scenes.
8100000	8107000	So like this one was a rowing game where you had to push the joystick in the direction that the tide was going.
8107000	8109000	So it was like a reaction type thing.
8109000	8115000	But then one of the coolest stages, the coolest music is the, um, yes, this one with the balls in the tunnel.
8122000	8124000	And he had to jump over the holes in the floor.
8124000	8126000	And he had to, it was a very tricky balance.
8126000	8128000	You can see how he keeps moving forward slightly.
8128000	8131000	It's because if you let it keep going, he'll just fall off the back.
8131000	8133000	And he slips and falls.
8134000	8138000	And then there's some random scenes that are inspired by the actual arcade game.
8138000	8140000	Let me see if I can get to one of those.
8141000	8145000	See like this is, the hand's coming up so he has to jump left. Things like that.
8145000	8150000	This arcade, this was like one of my favorite Commodore 64 games. It was so awesome.
8151000	8154000	Anyhow, just taking a trip down memory lane. That's all.
8154000	8156000	Any other last minute stories while no one calls?
8156000	8157000	Um, yeah.
8157000	8158000	I like to party.
8158000	8165000	There's a new, um, new indie game coming out on the Xbox marketplace called Avatar Legends.
8165000	8170000	It's going to be a role playing game, I guess by the developer Barker's Crest.
8170000	8173000	And it actually looks kind of cool.
8173000	8177000	It's going to be a 10 hour single player game. Co-op and multiplayer for up to six people.
8177000	8179000	A level and quest editor.
8179000	8181000	And you can create missions to share with your friends.
8181000	8184000	But you also, you play as your avatar.
8184000	8186000	And you actually get full control over them and stuff.
8186000	8187000	So that kind of looks neat.
8187000	8198000	And, um, I guess this says you can even drop people from your friends list into the game's NPC and set up, I guess, like different multiplayer and stuff.
8198000	8202000	Who the hell's calling me? Who's calling you? Don't they know you have a show?
8202000	8203000	Unless it's the wife.
8203000	8204000	My wife.
8204000	8205000	Uh oh.
8205000	8210000	Alright, so Loki's taking a phone call. And we're not. So...
8210000	8213000	I'm going to the Mii festival on Saturday.
8213000	8214000	What's the Mii festival?
8214000	8215000	Sakura Matsuri.
8215000	8217000	Ah, what goes on at the Sakura Matsuri festival?
8217000	8219000	It's where everyone has a parade in my honor.
8219000	8220000	Oh really?
8220000	8221000	Yeah, not really.
8221000	8222000	No, I don't think that's why they're doing the parade.
8222000	8227000	It's because the cherry blossoms are in bloom.
8227000	8229000	Okay, is everything okay?
8229000	8231000	Yeah, apparently. She's like, I'm going to call you back and leave a message.
8231000	8233000	Oh, okay. Phew.
8233000	8238000	I thought, she's never called during the show before. And I was like, oh, emergency. So, but I guess it's not that bad.
8238000	8241000	Oh no, the baby have started to move.
8241000	8245000	That could be it. Maybe the baby's getting a little more mobile. Who knows?
8245000	8247000	How are things going with the baby?
8247000	8252000	Uh, he's doing okay. He's wiggly.
8252000	8261000	Wants to roll around and not sleep. And he acts like he's teething, but there's nothing really coming in.
8261000	8264000	So, I don't know. We took him to the park today.
8264000	8268000	And uh, that's pretty much it.
8268000	8273000	Alright, we're finally getting some calls. Let's go to the phone and take them. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8273000	8275000	Hi, guys. This is DDR.Bill.
8275000	8279000	Wow, he's really quiet. Is it just, let me check your levels. I don't know if it's just here in the studio.
8279000	8281000	How are you doing, DDR.Bill?
8281000	8284000	Oh, doing alright. Just figured I'd give a call and say hi.
8284000	8290000	Hi. You are kind of quiet, but I think we can deal. You're not like, unhearable. What's up? What's on your mind?
8290000	8300000	Uh, nothing. I was trying to find a topic to talk about because I didn't want to call and turn into a bitchfest about Killer Instinct because I absolutely hated that game with that furious passion.
8300000	8306000	Hey, you know what? It's where every gamer has a voice, so some of us like Killer Instinct. Why do you hate Killer Instinct?
8306000	8322000	This was back when I started developing a real hatred of fighting games, especially with something like Killer Instinct where it was just memorizing bullshit amount of combos to the point of where my physics exam was easier than Killer Instinct.
8322000	8337000	But what about the whole, and I don't know if this is just Killer Instinct 2, but I thought Killer Instinct 1 had this too, where if you kind of just knew like the basics, like you know, the cross, the X pattern, and you know, you could do some pretty decent combos just knowing the patterns.
8337000	8344000	Like it wasn't like Mortal Kombat, dude. Like Mortal Kombat 3, you really had to memorize combos in order to get through that game. You know what I mean?
8344000	8355000	Like it was to the point where when I fired up Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox last week, I still remembered like a seven-hit cabal combo just because I had to memorize it like 10 years ago, you know?
8355000	8362000	Yeah, for Mortal Kombat 3, I'll agree with that because I've only memorized one character, and that was Sindel.
8362000	8371000	Dude, Sindel was awesome. Yes, it was like low kick, low kick, high punch, high punch, uppercut. Yeah, I used to know all the stuff for Sindel too. She was awesome.
8371000	8375000	Yeah, and that was the only count I played. I was like, eh, whatever.
8375000	8384000	They had some really dopey fatalities in Mortal Kombat 3 though. Like it wasn't one of her fatalities where like she whips them in her, like she literally whips her hair back and forth.
8384000	8394000	Like she whips them up in a little like ice cream cone looking thing and then whips her hair back and it just, it unravels the body and all the bones go flying. Like it's really stupid.
8394000	8397000	Like Mortal Kombat 3 was when it got really cartoony, you know what I mean?
8397000	8403000	Yeah, especially when her second one was when she screamed and your skin just came off. I was like, okay.
8403000	8405000	Yeah, yeah.
8405000	8411000	Yeah, but there's also, the thing also was that this came out also the same time around as the Virtua Fighter series coming out.
8411000	8422000	And Virtua Fighter, what I loved about that over things like Killer Instinct and even Street Fighter was it just felt more natural to play. Like it just, everything felt better at the time.
8422000	8433000	Like I really felt like I was actually, for the time I felt like, oh wow, my moves actually carried out. It made sense, not just memorizing combos and X, Y, Z, magic pattern, whatever.
8433000	8434000	Right.
8434000	8438000	You know, that's why I kind of had a really big dislike for it.
8438000	8447000	That and I got into a fistfight over some jackass in my college who, there was a whole stupid argument about it and I ended up punching him.
8447000	8449000	You got into a fistfight over this?
8449000	8456000	Yeah, cause he was like, he got to remember also that this kid was acting all bullshit gangster.
8456000	8458000	In other words, he had it coming.
8458000	8463000	I was like shut up and back and forth and then she just like punched him and walked away.
8463000	8469000	Wow, have you ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game? Dark Soccer, have you ever punched some bitch over a video game?
8469000	8471000	I punched my brother.
8471000	8472000	Did you really?
8472000	8477000	Yeah, cause we were playing Super Street Fighter IV, not four, why am I saying four, Super Street Fighter II.
8477000	8484000	When my brothers were still younger and he totally, totally, totally tried to grab my controller so I punched him.
8484000	8485000	Wow.
8485000	8486000	Oh damn.
8486000	8489000	Well you know, it's the bitch let go of my controller.
8489000	8493000	But you've never punched another girl over a video game?
8493000	8495000	I didn't know any other girls that played.
8495000	8498000	And then you hit them with pillows and then rub your boobies together.
8498000	8501000	No, I always played with dudes.
8501000	8502000	Oh okay.
8502000	8503000	But I punched them too.
8503000	8505000	And they thought it was funny.
8505000	8511000	I've always thought my coworkers are gonna do that to me during Grand Theft Auto cause I really piss them off when I play with them.
8511000	8512000	But uh, no.
8512000	8520000	Yeah, I don't think I've ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game. Like I think, you know, I've thrown controllers and I've probably thrown controllers at people.
8520000	8522000	Well my mother tried to take away my Nintendo once.
8522000	8523000	Oh god, I love this story.
8523000	8530000	And then she was gonna, gonna spank me because I uh, I got it out of the closet until I reminded her that she didn't buy it for me and that it was theft.
8530000	8531000	Whoops.
8531000	8534000	I was, no, I was seriously a little hellion.
8534000	8536000	Mother, there is condensation on the window.
8536000	8538000	That's my favorite story your mother told.
8538000	8540000	When I was three.
8540000	8543000	I just had a good vocabulary.
8543000	8544000	Okay.
8544000	8546000	So did I. I don't feel bad.
8546000	8548000	Sorry, I think we got off track a little bit DDR dollar bill.
8548000	8552000	Somehow we went to fist fight to condensation on the windows. That's okay.
8552000	8553000	It's alright.
8553000	8560000	And then the second thing also what got me, what I also wanted to talk about was that you were talking about the love of Commodore 64 games.
8560000	8561000	Yes.
8561000	8571000	That actually what got me started into emulation because I never actually played a Commodore until they actually started emulating the games, you know, I'd say the mid 90s.
8571000	8572000	Mmhmm.
8572000	8581000	And that's when I really started getting into it and the strangest thing was I actually was collecting magazines from England about Commodore games.
8581000	8588000	Well cause the Commodore 64 was huge over there. I mean I would like to think it was pretty big in the US but it was huge in the UK. Huge.
8588000	8594000	Oh definitely. The two magazines were The Games Machine and Zzap! 64.
8594000	8595000	Mmhmm.
8595000	8605000	And it was through those magazines that I actually downloaded a few games and that's when I found two of my all time favorite freaking soundtracks as you were saying.
8605000	8612000	Like you said Dragon Slayer Escape Ninja Slave was a good soundtrack and I'm agreeing with that one. It was really cool.
8612000	8613000	Uh huh. What else though?
8613000	8616000	But my favorite all time? Last Ninja 2.
8616000	8621000	Dude the last Ninja, those were some awesome games. Yeah.
8621000	8622000	Yeah.
8622000	8623000	Absolutely.
8623000	8625000	The second one though the music was just oh my god phenomenal.
8625000	8634000	Let's see if we can get some of the music here from this game. I don't know if we, this is some game play video so I don't know how much, I can't remember how much soundtrack was in the actual game. Let's see if we can get to here.
8634000	8638000	The first one was my favorite, Central Park, the first level. That was really good.
8638000	8641000	Okay let's see what we can do here.
8641000	8645000	Trying to play some of the music here from it.
8645000	8649000	Nah this thing's like muted or something.
8649000	8650000	Oh damn.
8650000	8654000	Well there's Amiga, let's see this Amiga version here. Let's see.
8654000	8663000	That's a different, that sounds a lot different.
8663000	8667000	Yeah that's the Amiga version. Hold on let me see if we have the Commodore 64 one.
8667000	8669000	Commodore 64 long play part one.
8669000	8671000	Here we go.
8671000	8677000	Ah yes, this is what I remember too.
8677000	8680000	Let's fast forward a little bit.
8680000	8688000	There's like a whole cinematic opening.
8688000	8690000	Oh this is The Last Ninja 3. My bad.
8690000	8695000	Oh, I'm trying to be actually. I'm trying one too.
8695000	8698000	Same type of thing though. Yeah they all had epic soundtracks though.
8698000	8699000	Oh definitely.
8699000	8700000	Awesome.
8700000	8704000	I actually grabbed someone, there was a group, I think it was Puffy64.
8704000	8710000	That actually remixed the soundtrack from the second one and added some rock in it.
8710000	8713000	I was like, I used that as my wrestling theme now for SmackDown vs Raw.
8713000	8718000	So you said there's one other Commodore 64 game you had a great soundtrack?
8718000	8720000	Usagi Yojimbo.
8720000	8722000	I don't even know this one.
8722000	8727000	That's like from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right?
8727000	8729000	Yes, they actually had a game for it.
8729000	8735000	Cool. I liked that character. I liked that he actually did a separate comic for him.
8735000	8741000	Let's see, there actually is a video here on the YouTubes.
8741000	8744000	Oh, this is the rabbit samurai thing.
8744000	8746000	Yeah, Usagi Yojimbo.
8746000	8752000	Oh, got it.
8752000	8755000	I love this song.
8755000	8758000	There you go. Alright, very cool.
8758000	8762000	People are still using Commodore 64s to make music, it's awesome.
8762000	8774000	I know, and it's like when you think about the way, the fact that it has about, it's supposedly about the same hardware I'm going to say as Nintendo, but they did a lot more than music, it just blows my mind apart.
8774000	8775000	Absolutely.
8775000	8781000	Alright, well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to try to take at least one more call here, but have a good one, okay buddy?
8781000	8782000	You too, thanks a lot guys.
8782000	8787000	Alright, thanks for the reminiscing of the Commodore 64 classics, and don't get into any more fistfights over a game.
8787000	8789000	I'll try not to.
8789000	8791000	Alright, later.
8791000	8797000	Wow, you know, I believe that the kids fought over video games a long time ago, but I don't remember.
8797000	8802000	You know, I played a lot of Street Fighter in the arcade, but I don't remember ever getting into a fistfight over it.
8802000	8804000	I remember a lot of trash talking.
8804000	8808000	Alright, any other last minute stories that we got going on tonight?
8808000	8809000	No.
8809000	8812000	Oh shit. Uh oh.
8812000	8813000	Huh?
8813000	8814000	I'm out of things to talk about.
8814000	8816000	Call us people, dammit!
8816000	8823000	Well, it's a minute and a half delay, so I posted it in chat, but it's going to take time before somebody gets through here.
8823000	8828000	We're going to need to have like a list of things to talk about when the phones are dead, or something.
8828000	8832000	Well, I've been doing a little bit of research, Rob, while we've been waiting for calls.
8832000	8835000	And if, did we get a call yesterday?
8835000	8838000	Yes, we got a call, so thank god. We'll come back to your thought, though, after this.
8838000	8840000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8840000	8841000	Ziba!
8841000	8843000	Ziba! How are you, my friend?
8843000	8847000	I'm doing good. I heard you guys talk about Commodore 64 a lot. I just wanted to give an update.
8847000	8850000	Of course we were, because it's awesome.
8850000	8858000	Remember when I called, I think it was before Christmas, or after Christmas or something, and I said I bought my boyfriend a Commodore 64?
8858000	8864000	Yes, yes I do, because I remember telling you you were like the best girlfriend ever for doing that. Yes, I do.
8864000	8874000	And then you guys told me I should look for something that will allow me to kind of use a flash card almost to play some games and do some stuff, but I actually did find something.
8874000	8876000	Oh, what did you find?
8876000	8892000	It's called UIEC. It's actually a, I guess this little SD card holder, and you actually hook it up to where the floppy drive hooks up to in the back of the Commodore.
8892000	8898000	And then you're actually able to put an SD card in it and save, just like a floppy drive.
8898000	8900000	Oh my god, that sounds awesome!
8900000	8912000	And it actually comes with its own firmware and all this stuff, and you can go online and get the hacked ROMs or whatever, the games, and you actually can put it on there and play them.
8912000	8927000	But it's really hard because it's really hard to find ones that actually work, because like you said, the Commodore 64 was really big in the UK and all those places in Europe, because it still is.
8927000	8930000	It still is? You know, I believe it.
8930000	8944000	There's actually conventions in Europe that actually, there's a lot of demo scenes now that people are still coding on this thing and making their own little demo scenes.
8944000	8956000	And some people do some really awesome stuff, and I've been trying to download some and play them, because you can do that too, but you can't play PAL demo scenes on a US Commodore.
8956000	8972000	So I'm actually thinking about getting a PAL Commodore 64 just so I can play games in the right speed, because you can still play PAL games, but they play really fast because of the Hertz difference and stuff, whatever.
8972000	8984000	But we're really enjoying it. My boyfriend has been coding and experimenting, and I just bought a joystick and I've been trying to play some games.
8984000	8986000	But we're still loving it, even today.
8986000	8989000	So what's one of the games on the Commodore 64 that you enjoy right now?
8989000	8991000	Cybernoid 2.
8991000	8998000	I remember Cybernoid. They made an NES port of the original one, and it's not as good as the Commodore 64 one, to be honest.
8998000	9010000	I really like the music and just, you know, shooting little, like, I don't even know what the monsters are called, because they're just like these little, I don't know, blobs.
9010000	9012000	But it's really fun. I really like it.
9012000	9016000	Let's see, I got a little bit of the gameplay here of Cybernoid 2.
9016000	9019000	This game was hard, too.
9019000	9027000	But there's lots of cheats that it came with, so you can still play with it, but it's really fun.
9027000	9033000	You know why the Commodore 64 was so awesome is because it was a little bit ahead of its time in the fact that you could hook it up to a TV.
9033000	9041000	And so a lot of you didn't have to buy a separate monitor for it, and I think that was part of what really drove it, is that it was kind of like a gaming console computer.
9041000	9048000	I mean, oh god, whenever I think of the 80s, I think of my Commodore 64, and just like, having that made me the nerd I am.
9048000	9050000	It really did.
9050000	9054000	We actually did have a hard time hooking up to TVs in here.
9054000	9060000	First, I was trying to use a Nintendo RF adapter, which didn't work very well.
9060000	9065000	So then I went online and I bought some cables, and it worked, but it was all black and white.
9065000	9068000	So I was going crazy trying to find something.
9068000	9078000	Finally, I went to Radio Shack and I got this adapter, and this little small adapter that allowed me to put a cable wire in it, and then hook it up to the TV that way.
9078000	9087000	But even, I was reading online, people were having lots of trouble putting it on a LCD TV because of the difference.
9087000	9088000	Oh sure.
9088000	9090000	I guess, yeah, since the TVs are new.
9090000	9091000	Oh sure, I bet.
9091000	9104000	You know, and the old, from what I remember, I actually had a Commodore 64 monitor, and what I remember of those cables, they were a little different because there were two video cable inputs and one audio.
9104000	9108000	And most RCA, the red, yellow, white, are two audio and one video.
9108000	9113000	And I think that's why a lot of people get black and white when they try to hook it up, is because of that.
9113000	9121000	So, yeah, but I guess, I'm sure with this still being popular to develop today, people are figuring it out, you know?
9121000	9124000	So, alright.
9124000	9126000	Alright, well thank you so much for the call, Ziba.
9126000	9127000	No problem.
9127000	9130000	Is there anything else you want to get out there before we let you go so we can get more calls?
9130000	9131000	No, that's it.
9131000	9133000	Alright, take care my friend.
9133000	9134000	Alright, bye bye.
9134000	9135000	Bye.
9135000	9141000	Alright, I guess we'll let there be one more call here before we wrap things up.
9141000	9143000	I'm excited to chat again to see if that will work.
9143000	9148000	Meanwhile, while we wait for that to come in, DarkSakura, what were we talking about a minute ago?
9148000	9149000	You were gonna...
9149000	9150000	I'm actually...
9150000	9151000	Oh, your project.
9151000	9154000	Yeah, I'm actually looking into logic board replacement.
9154000	9155000	Really?
9155000	9163000	Yeah, because you can't replace the processor because it's soldered into the logic board.
9163000	9166000	But you can replace the logic board with the processor on it.
9166000	9176000	So, I'm actually now... my goal is to still get the, you know, OSX working and everything.
9176000	9180000	But this is actually turning out to be a little bit more fun than I thought it was gonna be.
9180000	9186000	Because I can actually get a new logic board for about 100 bucks.
9186000	9188000	Alright, let's go to the phones. We have another call coming in.
9188000	9190000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9190000	9191000	Hey guys.
9191000	9192000	Hey.
9192000	9193000	I just know who it is.
9193000	9194000	This is DDR Angel, isn't it?
9194000	9195000	Hi.
9195000	9198000	Holy moly, I haven't heard from you in forever.
9198000	9201000	Well, I mean, I've seen you on Twitter and all that, some Facebook and all that.
9201000	9205000	But I mean, having you on OLR, this is like old school.
9205000	9211000	I remember, wasn't the first episode you ever came to of OLR episode 20?
9211000	9212000	I think it was.
9212000	9213000	Something like that.
9213000	9214000	Or like 22.
9214000	9218000	It was really... it was when OLR expanded from a two-hour show to a three-hour show officially.
9218000	9219000	I remember that.
9219000	9221000	Actually, it was when you were in that big house. I don't remember.
9221000	9222000	That was like 2003 or something.
9222000	9223000	It was a long time ago.
9223000	9225000	I think we've had like seven different studios since then.
9225000	9228000	Yeah, that was when I lived with a guy named Brian.
9228000	9229000	That was many years ago.
9229000	9230000	Yes.
9230000	9231000	Ten years ago.
9231000	9232000	Yep.
9232000	9233000	Crazy stuff.
9233000	9235000	I just called because the Skype line was open.
9235000	9237000	I didn't really have anything I wanted to say.
9237000	9238000	Well, you're lucky.
9238000	9247000	It's funny because now that people realize it's open, we're getting hammered with like five people all at once.
9247000	9249000	And I feel bad because some people can't get through.
9249000	9250000	But we'll see.
9250000	9254000	Well, DDR Angel, I know you didn't have a whole lot. You just want to kind of say hi.
9254000	9259000	But for those that are new to OLR, believe it or not, we're still here, as you can hear.
9259000	9263000	And we have a lot of people that we've picked up since the podcasting era.
9263000	9269000	When we switched to podcasting, we gained a whole lot of new listeners because you didn't have to be here live Sunday every week to listen.
9269000	9271000	But I know you've been listening to tonight's show.
9271000	9275000	What's kind of different about OLR than the way it used to be?
9275000	9281000	Well, to me, there's a lot of old stuff that's still there.
9281000	9283000	So, you know, the main part of the show is still there.
9283000	9286000	And I didn't see too much of a difference.
9286000	9290000	But, I mean, you guys do have, you know, a lot of other segments and stuff that you add in.
9290000	9294000	So it's just old LRR still being there.
9294000	9297000	But, you know, you just have your new segments too, which I like.
9297000	9300000	So it's all good. I mean, I don't know.
9300000	9301000	Awesome.
9301000	9306000	Well, anything else about the olden OLR days you want to enlighten these new kids with?
9306000	9310000	Cake pie. No, wait. You guys already did that.
9310000	9312000	Old school jokes.
9312000	9314000	We were joking about all that old stuff earlier.
9314000	9315000	Yeah.
9315000	9320000	So now, for those that are kind of catching up on lost time, you know, you used to come to the show as a guest quite often.
9320000	9321000	Yes.
9321000	9327000	Now, I remember you used to play a game called Here? Was that what it was called?
9327000	9328000	Oh, There.
9328000	9329000	There.
9329000	9330000	Yeah.
9330000	9331000	Very close.
9331000	9332000	Close. Very close.
9332000	9333000	Are you still involved?
9333000	9334000	They had to shut down.
9334000	9336000	Yeah, they had to shut down. Right. I remember that.
9336000	9339000	So sadly you're not. But you were with them right up until the very end, right?
9339000	9340000	Yes.
9340000	9341000	Awesome.
9341000	9342000	Gotcha. Gotcha.
9342000	9346000	And I believe you got married since the last time you were here?
9346000	9349000	Yeah, I did actually.
9349000	9360000	Somebody from the Balmany community a long time ago that used to come into the chat room by the name of Ohio BRP Balmany or whatever.
9360000	9361000	Uh-huh.
9361000	9362000	Yeah.
9362000	9364000	I don't remember his name actually.
9364000	9365000	Big Red Pimp?
9365000	9366000	Yes, Big Red Pimp.
9366000	9368000	It was a long time ago. There you go.
9368000	9370000	So you guys actually ended up getting married?
9370000	9371000	Yep.
9371000	9372000	Congratulations.
9372000	9373000	Thank you.
9373000	9375000	Are you still here in California? You moved out to Ohio, didn't you?
9375000	9377000	No, I didn't. No, no. I'm still in California.
9377000	9378000	No, he moved here.
9378000	9380000	I'm in Sonoma County actually.
9380000	9381000	Oh, you're still there?
9381000	9385000	Yeah, I'm still here. You can come by anytime, guys.
9385000	9390000	I might have to. That's awesome. I thought for some reason you went to Ohio for a bit.
9390000	9393000	Oh, no, no, no, no. He's just from here. He moved here.
9393000	9396000	Oh, okay. Got it. See, I'm a little bit behind on the times too.
9396000	9397000	No, it's all good.
9397000	9399000	All right, but you have a blog. I know you have a blog.
9399000	9400000	I do.
9400000	9401000	Do you want to pimp it real quick?
9401000	9402000	It has nothing to do with gaming.
9402000	9406000	That's all right. Why don't you go ahead and pimp your blog and I'll try to get one more call.
9406000	9410000	Sure. You guys can check it out at theecomaker.com.
9410000	9417000	I can type it in the chat room so that you guys can put it on the site or the notes or whatever you want to do.
9417000	9420000	And what will people find at theecomaker.com?
9420000	9429000	Pretty much anything to do with making your own cleaning products to making dinner for dinner ideas and such too.
9429000	9431000	It's a very homely site.
9431000	9433000	Yes, yes, it is.
9433000	9434000	All right. Welcome back.
9434000	9436000	But it also saves you money as well, so it kind of works out.
9436000	9440000	Welcome back and I'm really glad you decided to stop by tonight. It's always nice to see Blast From the Past.
9440000	9445000	Yeah, no problem. And hopefully I can check out our show at some point. I don't know. We'll have to talk about that.
9445000	9450000	Awesome. All right, well you take care and all the best to the hubby as well and you guys take care.
9450000	9451000	Definitely. You guys take care too.
9451000	9453000	All right. Bye.
9453000	9454000	Bye.
9454000	9456000	That was nice to hear from Blast From the Past.
9456000	9457000	Yep.
9457000	9459000	We've been doing this show a long fucking time, you know that?
9459000	9461000	Yeah, a long time.
9461000	9463000	But hey, we're going to make it to ten.
9463000	9468000	You know what? What the hell? One more call. Why not? We had a short news segment tonight.
9468000	9471000	We'll open up one more time. Just because our phones were getting slammed there a minute ago.
9471000	9477000	So we'll open it up one more time for you guys. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9477000	9479000	The phone lines are open.
9479000	9486000	But of course this means while I wait for the little delay there, I have to think of another banter topic with Dark Sakura.
9486000	9490000	I'm nearly... I'm excited, Rob.
9490000	9492000	How so? With your project?
9492000	9495000	Yeah. Thank you for making this possible.
9495000	9497000	You're welcome.
9497000	9499000	Well, I was just collecting dust at your place anyway.
9499000	9501000	Yeah, it's true. No, the old laptop.
9501000	9504000	You know, it's amazing the stuff I'm finding while I'm going through and unpacking this.
9504000	9506000	I found an old picture of you.
9506000	9507000	Of me.
9507000	9513000	And Melody taping an episode of Under Sedation Live in Travis's old backyard.
9513000	9517000	Oh.
9517000	9519000	An old, old picture.
9519000	9523000	Melody all huddled together looking cute during... I remember this too. Travis did.
9523000	9524000	Yeah.
9524000	9527000	He did like a backyard episode of Under Sedation Live. I don't remember what the shtick was.
9527000	9528000	You'll have to bring it over.
9528000	9532000	There's always some shtick with Travis. I love him, but there's always some shtick.
9532000	9534000	And this is the backyard episode shtick.
9534000	9535000	Yeah.
9535000	9538000	Oh yeah, I found that. I found one of all of us on a DDR machine.
9538000	9544000	It was me, you, Irene. The guy Irene was dating at the time.
9544000	9546000	So she probably don't want to see that picture.
9546000	9549000	You and I... Who else was in it? I think one other person was all in the picture.
9549000	9552000	Maybe Brad?
9552000	9553000	Oh, Bradley? No.
9553000	9555000	Not Bradley. Brad.
9555000	9558000	Yeah, I think he's in it. Hence the crazy person that Irene was dating at the time.
9558000	9559000	Yeah.
9559000	9563000	I don't know. I don't know. I don't remember what else. Somebody else I think was in that picture.
9563000	9567000	He was our Mighty Mormon Power Ranger.
9567000	9570000	Let's see. What else did I find when I was moving?
9570000	9573000	Let me know if you find the install disks.
9573000	9574000	For what? The laptop?
9574000	9575000	Yeah.
9575000	9578000	I doubt I'll find that.
9578000	9579000	You know I'm being silly.
9579000	9581000	I know.
9581000	9583000	I want to see the old pictures.
9583000	9585000	I will find those pictures and I will get them to you.
9585000	9588000	All right, finally the calls are coming in. The delay caught up.
9588000	9590000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9590000	9596000	I made it in. Wow, you guys are like trying to call Britney Spears on a Friday night or something.
9596000	9598000	It's great. It feels special.
9598000	9603000	This is Derek H. Derek from Virginia Beach, Virginia.
9603000	9607000	Derek, how are you? Of course I recognize your voice the minute I picked up. How are you, my friend?
9607000	9610000	Eh, you know, it's this and that.
9610000	9617000	The important thing is the Commodore 64, I had one. I loved it.
9617000	9620000	I started with a VIC-20, went all the way up to an Amiga 1200.
9620000	9626000	0306060 for those in the know. I'm sorry, 0304040.
9626000	9630000	You stuck with Commodore for a very long time because the Amigas were like the last big hurrahs for them.
9630000	9637000	Yeah, that was sad because if you had an Amiga, you were the type of person that believed.
9637000	9646000	And I mean like you believed that one day everybody else would wake up and everybody would be using Amigas.
9646000	9652000	And you will be vindicated for all your years of, yeah, that never happened.
9652000	9657000	Amigas were kind of the max of their time, which is ironic because max were out at the same time.
9657000	9661000	But you know how people pay the premiums for the Apple products these days?
9661000	9664000	Amiga was kind of like that back in the day, in a way.
9664000	9670000	You know what has happened to Mac? That's what Amiga people thought were going to happen for Amiga.
9670000	9673000	It had it all.
9673000	9679000	If only they had cellular phones when Commodore was big. Maybe they could have been the ones to think of it first.
9679000	9683000	That Amiga was so great. But the Commodore 64, I guess, is what we're talking about.
9683000	9690000	The Amiga was kick-ass. You said you were thinking about going to get one. Yeah, don't do that.
9690000	9693000	Why? Are they all in terrible shape?
9693000	9701000	Stick with the emulation because once you get one, it's like all of a sudden everything rushes back to you.
9701000	9710000	Except it rushes back to you in present day because computers now are literally two to three thousand times faster than the Commodore 64.
9710000	9715000	That's not even an exaggeration. Like, a thousand times faster than that thing.
9715000	9720000	Yeah, the 64 was for what? 64K of memory that was in that thing?
9720000	9725000	64K. I have more memory on one web page.
9725000	9727000	Exactly. Yep.
9727000	9729000	Good Lord.
9729000	9741000	Games, you think they're going to play right, but they don't because back then you expected the lag.
9741000	9746000	When you move the joystick, you expected a half second or second thing before something moved on the screen.
9746000	9751000	Nowadays, if that happens, you're like, what the hell is wrong with this thing? What's wrong?
9751000	9758000	And then you'll fall out of love with the Commodore. Remember the Commodore 64 as it is. As it was, not as it is.
9758000	9763000	This happens a lot in gaming. You know, things are better through those retro colored glasses.
9763000	9769000	Or, you know, they say the rose colored glasses, but the retro colored glasses, sometimes I think we remember gaming better that way.
9769000	9773000	And I just mentioned this earlier in the show, the X-Men arcade game that's on Xbox Live.
9773000	9780000	I love the X-Men arcade game, but then when I downloaded it on Xbox Live, I was like, what is this crap that I used to love? You know?
9780000	9783000	What the hell is going on here?
9783000	9788000	And my favorite game of all time, you guys are talking about favorite games too.
9788000	9796000	My favorite game of all time is not just my favorite game of all time, it is the greatest game of all time. Period. End of story.
9796000	9798000	And that is Elite.
9798000	9799000	Elite?
9799000	9813000	Elite is insanely good. And for what they stuck on that 64K and that floppy disk, which I think held like 150K or something, some stupid low number.
9813000	9824000	It had more worlds on Elite than Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, all of the Wing Commanders combined.
9824000	9831000	You got Jamie's husband, Dan, up from the couch to come in here to say and agree with you that Elite was awesome, just so you know.
9831000	9838000	All the stuff that people say you can do is like, oh, it's an open world. If you want to do this, if you want to be a rogue, be a rogue.
9838000	9849000	Elite had that, except it was 25 years ago on a Commodore 64. You can literally say, I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life just moving corn back and forth between these two planets.
9849000	9854000	Or I'm just gonna be a policeman and hang out and just kill bad guys while they're trying to run.
9854000	9864000	Or you can beat anything in that game thousands of years before Grand Theft Auto 4 came around.
9864000	9870000	Or Star Wars Galaxies Old School of the Jedis thing.
9870000	9877000	You know, I think the Mass Effect comparison is a pretty good one with Elite. It was like a space game, right?
9877000	9884000	Yeah, you could pick your own ship, you could outfit your ship, they had tribbles in it.
9884000	9890000	I don't want to play the game, but I can't play it because it's on the freaking Commodore 64 and it's gonna suck if I play it now.
9890000	9894000	You have to remember it how it was, Derek. You have to remember it how it was.
9894000	9900000	The original SimCity was on the Commodore 64, and of course that game's blown up a million times over.
9900000	9905000	What was another great Commodore 64 game? I remember Spy vs. Spy was one of my favorites.
9905000	9907000	Little Computer People is The Sims.
9907000	9913000	Oh yes, Little Computer People. Oh god, Mule, M-U-L-E, was a huge game.
9913000	9917000	That's just a lot of economics in games kind of gets its cue from Mule.
9917000	9919000	Good times, Derek, good times.
9919000	9923000	Hey, I have to ask you this because, you know, if we both kind of grew up on Commodore,
9923000	9926000	did you ever used to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines?
9926000	9933000	Of course. Video games and computer entertainment had a little thing I would sit there and type it in.
9933000	9943000	And here's the sad part. I did not get a break of 1541 for like a year because we were poor.
9943000	9950000	And I still thank my mom because now I don't know how she got me that Commodore 64 because we were poor and she got me one.
9950000	9953000	So I thank her every day for getting me started on this.
9953000	9956000	But it took her a while before I got to 1541.
9956000	9962000	So I would sit there and type those programs in and tell everybody not to come near my computer
9962000	9969000	and I'll put a pillow over top of it and hide it so nobody would turn it off because once you turn it off, it's gone.
9969000	9972000	There's no flash ram saving stuff.
9972000	9975000	You didn't have a drive to save on?
9975000	9980000	Save. And plus when I first got it, I typed load and load didn't work.
9980000	9982000	You had to type load comma eight comma one.
9982000	9983000	Yeah.
9983000	9986000	It took me a while to figure it out. I was like, this thing is broke, mom.
9986000	9988000	It don't work.
9988000	9993000	And I knew she wasn't, but I knew if she took it back, she wasn't replacing it.
9993000	9995000	She was taking it back and getting her money and I would never see that again.
9995000	9999000	So I would just, I would cry without getting it working.
9999000	10003000	But you know what? You stuck with it and maybe it taught you a lesson.
10003000	10004000	Yeah.
10004000	10010000	It taught me not to believe in miracles.
10010000	10012000	Speaking of believing in miracles, I have to ask this.
10012000	10017000	Obviously, a lot of people on the All Games Network know you from your show, Dead Pixel Live.
10017000	10020000	I know you're on a little bit of a siesta right now,
10020000	10025000	enjoying your Mai Tais on the beach while you're taking a break from Dead Pixel Live.
10025000	10031000	But any chance of a revival in the future?
10031000	10035000	All I can say now is Dead Pixel Live is currently on hiatus.
10035000	10040000	I have found out, as you guys may or may not know, I'm sure you do know,
10040000	10043000	this thing kind of fills a hole in your life.
10043000	10044000	Yeah.
10044000	10049000	And without it, all of a sudden you realize, like, I miss a lot of,
10049000	10053000	I kind of want to do my show again, but I guess that maybe I should get out more.
10053000	10055000	But I really want to do my show.
10055000	10059000	It's like, it's good that it was there, but the fact, I don't know,
10059000	10062000	it's all psychological stuff done working.
10062000	10066000	I really don't know what I'd do with my Sunday nights without OLR.
10066000	10068000	I'd probably be watching Desperate Housewives and that's just sad.
10068000	10072000	I know what I would do. I would play more Dragon Age 2.
10072000	10074000	Not now, but all right.
10074000	10077000	Then you'd be like, I want to tell somebody about Dragon Age 2.
10077000	10080000	I remember when I had a show and it was a lot of fun.
10080000	10083000	Actually, I'd probably just do another show.
10083000	10088000	Oh, listen to how she is. I would just do a show without you guys.
10088000	10092000	No, I couldn't do it without you guys.
10092000	10094000	Maybe with Tiara.
10094000	10097000	All right. Well, Derek, best of luck in whatever it is you do.
10097000	10100000	And thanks so much for the call and taking a trip down memory lane with us.
10100000	10102000	Hey, thanks. Hey, Amiga forever.
10102000	10105000	That's right. Take care, buddy.
10105000	10107000	All right. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10107000	10111000	Those are some good calls. See, it was worth waiting for.
10111000	10113000	Even though, and some folks still didn't get through.
10113000	10115000	I'm so sorry. We had more people beeping us.
10115000	10117000	The phones were lighting up. Send us an email.
10117000	10120000	We had two emails and a lit up phone line.
10120000	10121000	What's wrong with this picture?
10121000	10123000	Not one, but two.
10123000	10126000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Send us your thoughts in email.
10126000	10128000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
10128000	10131000	but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
10131000	10135000	Loki, we'll start with you tonight. Your final thought?
10135000	10139000	Designing a free-running course is hard.
10139000	10143000	My final thought is I still have kitchenware to pack. Joy.
10143000	10145000	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
10145000	10149000	I wonder what my hair was like in that picture.
10149000	10150000	Was it long?
10150000	10151000	I think so.
10151000	10154000	It was when I had long, really kind of crabby, bushy hair that was five to six shades of red.
10154000	10155000	Yes.
10155000	10156000	Yeah.
10156000	10157000	Good times.
10157000	10159000	But I have much better hair these days.

10191000	10193000	Mortal Kombat will be out. We'll have tons of stuff to talk about.
10193000	10195000	And I'll thank whoever got me Portal 2.
