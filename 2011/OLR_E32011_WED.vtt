01:05.280 --> 01:09.920
Carrot. So you've gone from meat last night to carrot tonight. Yes because I want something

01:09.920 --> 01:15.440
crunchy. All right and also joining us tonight say hello to Dan the man is here in studio. Hello

01:15.440 --> 01:20.320
hello. How you doing? I'm doing good. Good you're on Loki's night so or excuse me Loki's mic so

01:20.320 --> 01:26.000
you're not as loud as you were last night. I get to sit in my own desk. The guest mic is so

01:26.000 --> 01:31.520
freaky in here but oh well nobody cares about that. I blame you. We are live of course live on

01:31.520 --> 01:36.240
Ustream if this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream this is not where we're usually

01:36.240 --> 01:41.120
at we do a Sunday night live show every week at All Games Radio. More information about our

01:41.120 --> 01:46.560
podcast and all that good stuff www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen to last

01:46.560 --> 01:55.360
night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U and Xbox and Kinect and and the Vita. We're gonna

01:55.360 --> 02:00.400
actually get more into the Vita tonight. It is live of course you can join us in our chat room

02:00.400 --> 02:06.560
at chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you have any live comments you want to give us as we're

02:06.560 --> 02:12.480
broadcasting here live. Speaking of live sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to

02:12.480 --> 02:16.080
mix things up a little bit tonight. We're not gonna start with Bobby tonight. Bobby's caught

02:16.080 --> 02:21.760
in traffic. He's still in LA downtown. I guess the last text I got is that a transformer blew

02:21.760 --> 02:26.960
out somewhere. So sorry Bobby fans we're gonna have to go to him a little later but we're gonna

02:26.960 --> 02:31.920
go right into today's coverage of E3 and from what I understand our correspondents out on the floor

02:31.920 --> 02:37.040
got some more hands-on impressions today. As you know yesterday Bobby waited for quite a while in

02:37.040 --> 02:41.920
that Wii U Wii U Wii U line to about what like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U

02:41.920 --> 02:48.960
and gave us his impressions yesterday. Tonight we're gonna go straight over to Miek Letov who

02:48.960 --> 02:56.000
was on the show floor and I think he was waiting for like three or four hours today to play the PS

02:56.000 --> 03:00.800
Vita. So it's kind of interesting that both of them have very long lines waiting to play them.

03:00.800 --> 03:07.440
So we're gonna go to Miek Letov right now through the magic of the internet we're gonna call his

03:07.440 --> 03:12.160
little cell phone and see what else he played today because I know the show hours are usually

03:12.160 --> 03:17.280
longest on this second day so hopefully got to play a lot more today. I don't know if he got to

03:17.280 --> 03:22.160
go play more Konami stuff like Silent Hill which he said it wasn't that great which made Jamie sad.

03:22.800 --> 03:28.720
Very sad in my soul. But of course it's just his opinion it's just one opinion so we'll see maybe

03:28.720 --> 03:34.960
Bobby got to play it today we'll see if he thought the same thing. Hello? Hey is this Miek Letov?

03:35.920 --> 03:40.240
Yes. Hey it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio of course you should know that I just texted you

03:40.240 --> 03:46.000
thanks for letting us. I know it's so surprising. Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
and bringing you on first tonight. Bobby's caught in traffic where are you are you are you back at

03:50.000 --> 03:57.280
your hotel? Yes I made it back. It's fine after 50 minutes of commuting. Do you how do you get now

03:57.280 --> 04:03.920
yeah for those who have never been to E3 and have heard about LA traffic it really is a nightmare

04:03.920 --> 04:07.840
that's why I'm not looking forward to being in it tomorrow when we go to pick Bobby up at the

04:07.840 --> 04:13.040
convention center but uh it'll be all right. At least we'll have each other right Dark Sakura?

04:13.600 --> 04:19.040
Yes. Right Dan? Of course. All right anyway so Miek Letov how was E3 for you today?

04:19.040 --> 04:26.720
It was well I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about

04:26.720 --> 04:32.400
three hours if that because today was my stand-in-line day. Today was your stand-in-line

04:32.400 --> 04:38.400
day so I already mentioned that I know you stood in line for the PS Vita right? Yep. Good I'm glad

04:38.400 --> 04:41.840
we get to talk about because yesterday was a little bit Nintendo heavy with all the Wii U

04:41.840 --> 04:45.920
talks so I'm glad we get to talk a little bit about the PS Vita today so tell us about your

04:45.920 --> 04:51.120
experiences everything from standing in line how long to when you finally got your hands on the

04:51.120 --> 04:59.840
goods? It took about four hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10 30

04:59.840 --> 05:06.560
so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it if you can consider it that I

05:06.560 --> 05:12.800
did play with it for about 20 minutes so I got some good hands-on time with it. Not bad yeah

05:12.800 --> 05:19.680
what are your thoughts? I really like it it's definitely a great successor to the PSP

05:20.400 --> 05:28.080
for the design part of the system the screen is beautiful it's really big it's really vibrant

05:28.080 --> 05:34.480
you really don't see any pixels whatsoever definitely a nice high-desk screen

05:35.280 --> 05:42.400
the the back part with the touchpad I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too

05:42.400 --> 05:49.120
much of the back so you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you know you use

05:49.120 --> 05:56.160
the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up but that's just a minor uh minor complaint I'm

05:56.160 --> 05:59.760
sure if I held it the right way because it's grips it would be a little bit better. I wonder

05:59.760 --> 06:03.840
if you can just turn that crap off do you think do you think you just turn off that back touchpad

06:03.840 --> 06:07.360
altogether because I didn't even think about that but yeah if you have a tendency like tap on the

06:07.360 --> 06:12.560
back of your device or something it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff right?

06:12.560 --> 06:18.320
Yeah it will um I assume that some games will have that I don't think it will be a system setting

06:20.160 --> 06:26.160
but so yeah there's that part and the one thing that I actually do not like about the system is

06:26.160 --> 06:31.840
that the face buttons are way too small like I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit

06:31.840 --> 06:37.760
the x button but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the x

06:37.760 --> 06:42.560
button should be instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.640
So it sounds like maybe there's some design things that need to be worked out or is this

06:46.640 --> 06:50.320
is this pretty much like the final thing that you guys are seeing did they say anything about

06:50.320 --> 06:57.600
prototype or how far along it is? Um I did not ask and they did not say I assume because of how

06:57.600 --> 07:02.080
close to I mean really if you think about if it's supposed to be this this holiday it's only a few

07:02.080 --> 07:09.200
months out so I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design. I thought the ds was shown

07:09.200 --> 07:13.360
and it went through a lot of changes I mean this is many years ago it was shown at e3 and it went

07:13.360 --> 07:18.240
through many changes before it was released uh but maybe not because I think that might have come out

07:18.240 --> 07:24.000
the ds came out what March or April I guess so thinking of the ds as being many years ago is sad

07:24.000 --> 07:32.400
I know that was my first e3 I think all of ours was the year the ds was yeah anyhow uh so okay so

07:32.400 --> 07:36.400
this isn't about the ps or the ds though it's about the ps vita um so tell us about some of

07:36.400 --> 07:41.440
the games that you play and what they were like okay they had a station set up for us to go to

07:41.440 --> 07:46.080
about five minutes on each or was it four I don't remember I can't remember the amount of stations

07:46.080 --> 07:52.960
but I'll whisk them off um the first one we went to was the little big planet station so we got

07:52.960 --> 07:58.400
to play um or you got your choice of a couple different um options in little big planet you

07:58.400 --> 08:04.240
could play a stage or you could play um a two player game using just a touch screen and you

08:04.240 --> 08:08.880
would play with the demo guy I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would

08:08.880 --> 08:15.280
really work in the practical play um and I was really impressed uh I used everything from the

08:15.280 --> 08:22.000
the touchpad to tilting the system or not touchpad sorry the touch screen to tilting the system and

08:22.000 --> 08:26.720
it played like little big planet and it looked like little big planet on the ps3 so like I was

08:26.720 --> 08:32.080
really impressed um one of the puzzles that had me do was there was a keyboard in the background

08:32.080 --> 08:38.560
and I had to play or I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it opened the

08:38.560 --> 08:44.320
door and I thought that was really cool uh and so you say it looked just like little big planet on

08:44.320 --> 08:50.720
the ps3 so did it feel like it was just kind of a port of the ps3 you know original with maybe some

08:50.720 --> 08:55.840
uh frills that incorporate the vita stuff like the the back touching or whatever did it feel

08:55.840 --> 09:01.840
like like just a whole separate experience like it's not you know just a port I would say it felt

09:01.840 --> 09:09.200
more like a separate experience because the vita special features really made it feel that way um

09:10.240 --> 09:16.560
so like there was a part where I had to hold on to a one of the little uh spinning wheels

09:16.560 --> 09:22.720
and it wasn't spinning yet so while I was holding it with the uh r trigger um or whatever it's called

09:22.720 --> 09:29.920
the r button um I had to use my uh left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up

09:29.920 --> 09:34.960
to the top I was like that's awesome you know this is cool well I would expect talking about

09:34.960 --> 09:39.200
the design of the system again in your hands and the way that whole works uh kaijuto is in our chat

09:39.200 --> 09:44.320
room at chat.orangelandreay.com saying this guy must have fred flinstone thumbs do you just have

09:44.320 --> 09:53.040
abnormal hands no no these are really small like I my hands are not big at all and these I swear

09:53.040 --> 09:59.680
were like the size of mini m&ms something people might know okay there you go that's a good

09:59.680 --> 10:07.440
comparison okay so what else little big planet and okay after that they sent us over to virtual

10:07.440 --> 10:15.280
tennis which um so far these two games I was told are launch titles for the system um so virtual

10:15.280 --> 10:23.120
tennis really nice looking um they had you play it first with the just touch screen so you would

10:23.120 --> 10:27.120
press the spot on the court to move your guy you hold your finger down your guy would move

10:27.120 --> 10:33.200
and then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin and it actually

10:33.200 --> 10:40.240
and it actually worked really well um then I was introduced to control how is that touch screen

10:40.240 --> 10:43.920
stuff different from like playing an iphone game or is that really what it felt like like oh I'm

10:43.920 --> 10:49.520
playing an iphone that's really what it felt like with nice graphics okay and it was on a bigger

10:49.520 --> 10:59.360
screen okay and um yeah so then uh he told me to do all my um hits uh with the touch screen and

10:59.360 --> 11:04.240
I could move with the analog stick like okay this actually I kind of like the way that one played

11:04.240 --> 11:08.480
um and then it's like oh just play normally and you know I could play normally it wasn't like

11:08.480 --> 11:12.240
super impressive but it was still really fun because virtual tennis games are pretty fun

11:14.480 --> 11:21.840
so after my time was up there um I went to the what's that super game called

11:21.840 --> 11:28.720
little deviants that game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up

11:28.720 --> 11:36.000
nintendo with um it seems to be a collection of mini games for the most part um there were three

11:36.000 --> 11:43.280
that we got to play the first one was an ar game just like face rater to a t like with the

11:43.280 --> 11:48.720
exception of putting somebody's face in it uh you just look around with your screen all over

11:48.720 --> 11:52.320
all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to

11:52.320 --> 12:00.320
destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters um the next one was a whack-a-mole

12:00.320 --> 12:05.600
style game that used both the touch screen and the touch pad on the back so windows would open

12:05.600 --> 12:10.640
up and if they were facing you you had to touch the touch screen on them um and if they were

12:10.640 --> 12:16.960
back turned to you you had to press from behind underneath um and watch out for the humans because

12:16.960 --> 12:22.640
you lost points for that these all definitely sound like little like gimmicky demos that

12:22.640 --> 12:28.000
to be fair is probably the same stuff the same stuff they're demoing the wii u with right now so

12:29.600 --> 12:36.880
exactly um the last one was uh this uh it's the one that probably everybody's seen where you have

12:36.880 --> 12:42.400
the touch pad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball the bvm ball guy around

12:42.400 --> 12:48.880
into the whirlpool that one was probably what really frustrated me most with the the touch pad

12:48.880 --> 12:55.520
on the back just because i mean it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the

12:55.520 --> 13:01.200
pads the way they don't want you to do it um and there was no clear definition on the back where

13:01.200 --> 13:07.120
the touchpad started where it ended so that one was really hard for me so little deviance though

13:07.120 --> 13:11.360
it sounds like it's just a mini game collection i don't know to me it kind of sounds like a pass

13:11.360 --> 13:18.400
i've seen it before what did you think uh i'm it's not a not a purchase for me at all um it was like

13:18.400 --> 13:25.440
bundled in with the system i'm not gonna delete it but i'm not gonna purchase it okay all right

13:25.440 --> 13:34.000
um the next one i went to uh was sound what did i call it sound something or other sound sound

13:34.000 --> 13:41.680
something was it a music game um yes it kind of was um man now i feel bad because i was talking

13:41.680 --> 13:46.400
about how much i love that game sound shapes i'm looking at your text from earlier sound shapes

13:47.600 --> 13:52.320
yes so thank you sound shapes which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at

13:52.320 --> 13:56.080
the press conference so when you texted me that i'm like what the hell is that that must be like a

13:56.080 --> 14:02.320
game they didn't say anything about otherwise it's been talked about before i know that um it's made

14:02.320 --> 14:09.120
by the guy that did i want to say like either pixel junk or everyday shooter i don't remember

14:09.120 --> 14:15.600
it's one of those two um but in it it's got two modes it's got a platforming mode which is very

14:15.600 --> 14:24.720
simplistic shapes um you're just like little blue spiky ball looking thing but the object is to get

14:24.720 --> 14:29.760
through the level and to hit these blue orbs and every time you hit a blue orb in that screen

14:29.760 --> 14:36.240
it creates like the drums for the music or it creates the guitar or the keyboard so you keep

14:36.240 --> 14:39.600
going looking at the audio you guys are hearing in the background i'm looking at a video of this

14:39.600 --> 14:45.840
because i want to see more about what he's talking about here oh the guy's talking through it

14:47.360 --> 14:56.000
yeah we can't have two people talking i'll i'll just look at the video then but uh yeah so you go

14:56.000 --> 15:01.120
through uh different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music it was very

15:02.000 --> 15:11.680
much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away um i was told again launch title and

15:11.680 --> 15:16.240
that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play

15:16.240 --> 15:22.560
oh cool that's really cool and that's the other part of the um demo it was he was showing me how

15:22.560 --> 15:28.800
to create my own stage and placing music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps

15:28.800 --> 15:35.280
and it was really cool i liked it a lot interesting as a music game fan uh this is kind of a must-have

15:35.280 --> 15:39.520
for you because i'm looking at this going this does not look at all like other music games but

15:39.520 --> 15:45.600
i'm i'm glad because i think it's you know i don't always need to see falling notes that you hit

15:45.600 --> 15:52.320
whatever device too you know so this is kind of nice yeah i i think it's it's not only a game for

15:52.320 --> 15:58.560
music fans but also for um possibly platforming fans because people who like to get high and play

15:58.560 --> 16:05.280
video games what was that people who like to get high and play video games no because they'll

16:05.280 --> 16:11.520
probably like try to eat their psv or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster okay we need

16:11.520 --> 16:20.000
we need we need new crack since moja ribbons already out that's kind of like it's simplistic

16:20.000 --> 16:27.760
like that like like the brib and stuff so i think it was great um definitely gonna be the first game

16:27.760 --> 16:32.080
i buy because it was the one that impressed me the most which makes me sad because the next demo

16:32.080 --> 16:37.600
playing too was uncharted and that was the game that at first announcement had pulled me on the

16:37.600 --> 16:45.120
vita before it was called that and before i played it um and it didn't disappoint me per se uh i think

16:45.120 --> 16:52.080
it looked beautiful and played like uncharted my problem with it is those tiny little m&m buttons

16:52.080 --> 17:01.120
that um like they just got in my way i couldn't perform moves as well uh i definitely got shot

17:01.120 --> 17:08.000
and killed twice during our demo because i couldn't get the button properly um that wasn't

17:08.000 --> 17:14.080
any of the top screen controls of what was that did you try any of the touch screen controls

17:14.080 --> 17:19.600
stealth takedowns jumping stuff like that see that that's what i'm about to i was about to say

17:19.600 --> 17:26.000
is that like i like the what they called painting where you move your finger across like ledges and

17:26.000 --> 17:31.920
he would move there that was cool but once you used it for hand-to-hand combat i hated it i

17:31.920 --> 17:38.000
absolutely thought it was stupid because i have to instead of like you know position myself with

17:38.000 --> 17:44.560
the camera and my body for the next enemy after i'm done punching this guy to death it takes one

17:44.560 --> 17:51.360
hand off of that and i have to focus on tapping the little fist icon which was stupid i thought

17:51.360 --> 17:54.160
you would like that because when i was seeing that in the trailer i was like that looks like

17:54.160 --> 17:59.600
elite beat agents and that's like belita's favorite game no no it's nothing like that

17:59.600 --> 18:06.560
at all it was frustrating and kind of annoying but um i'm sure that that will not be the only

18:06.560 --> 18:15.200
way to play um i don't even could probably use the little m&m buttons to hit too but uh the demo

18:15.200 --> 18:19.280
i didn't get a chance to try that because like oh use the touch screen only for combat it's like

18:19.280 --> 18:29.520
okay thanks for getting me killed but um yeah that ended the ps vita experience so it was

18:29.520 --> 18:36.960
worth the four hour wait yes i think so because i think i have waited in long lines at e3 to four

18:36.960 --> 18:43.200
and not come away as satisfied as i did with the vita okay all right so now what's interesting

18:43.200 --> 18:46.720
though is that you even though you enjoyed the vita and you're like okay i definitely want this

18:46.720 --> 18:50.960
sound shapes game and there's a couple other things i played that i want i really need them

18:50.960 --> 18:57.360
to fix some of these design issues even though there might not be any time now yeah i i don't

18:57.360 --> 19:03.040
think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because i think a lot of that has

19:03.040 --> 19:09.520
to do with my hands being more accustomed to holding like a psp so it like my my fingers

19:09.520 --> 19:15.360
gravitate to where um i think it's going to be at because i mean let's be honest it looks just like

19:15.360 --> 19:22.640
a psp it's a little bit like longer um a little bit wider and a lot lighter actually it's like

19:22.640 --> 19:27.840
nothing in your hands whatsoever um let me ask this question real quick because you know you

19:27.840 --> 19:31.440
said that you definitely want to get the ps vita and i walked away from the sony press conference

19:31.440 --> 19:36.560
saying i'm not really sure i understand why i need a vita still and and my whole thing was that

19:36.560 --> 19:44.000
okay it just looks like it's a uh you know psp with a back touch thing a front touch thing and

19:44.000 --> 19:51.280
slightly more power so what once it's slightly more power a lot more power a lot more but we'll

19:51.280 --> 19:56.160
see i think the psp as it is still holds up and looks really really good there's a lot of really

19:56.160 --> 20:01.520
good looking games on there so the psv is even better yes interesting i guess maybe the

20:01.520 --> 20:05.840
screenshots online is such just don't do it justice so i'm looking forward it doesn't like

20:06.640 --> 20:12.240
when you see the screen in person that that's what got my attention first and then the weight

20:12.240 --> 20:18.640
in my hands got it second and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once now i kind

20:18.640 --> 20:23.040
of asked bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the wii u uh most of the day

20:23.040 --> 20:27.440
you waited in line for the ps vita most of the day did you catch any kind of like buzz from people

20:27.440 --> 20:31.440
around you now see the funny thing was bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak

20:31.440 --> 20:35.520
english yesterday so there was like no one for him to listen to but did you did you kind of catch

20:35.520 --> 20:39.360
what was the buzz what were other people saying about the vita were people complaining about the

20:39.360 --> 20:46.000
controller like you were or i didn't hear any complaints about the vita except for the long

20:46.000 --> 20:51.600
wait time like i had people behind me leave a couple times because they were tired of waiting

20:51.600 --> 20:57.920
clearly this must have been their first c3 because you know you have to wait forever for stuff yes

20:57.920 --> 21:03.120
um i didn't hear any buzz about vita i did over here i'm not sure if this is considered i'm sure

21:03.120 --> 21:10.400
it probably has but i heard something about skyrim randomly um from a dev saying that the uh it was

21:10.400 --> 21:16.320
a bethesda dev so it wasn't like some random person but they were talking to um one of the

21:16.320 --> 21:22.480
naughty dog people that were over there and they said that um skyrim is going to have about 30

21:22.480 --> 21:29.120
hours of main quest and 300 hours of side quest nice uh i know bobby got some i i don't know if

21:29.120 --> 21:33.520
he got no he didn't get hands-on he got like a 30-minute demo with skyrim today so he was

21:33.520 --> 21:38.320
he got a little special bethesda show so uh we'll talk to him more about the details there later

21:38.320 --> 21:43.120
i do like over maybe i'm just nosy but i like one of my favorite things at e3 is to just like over

21:43.120 --> 21:48.160
here people because people do talk about rather loudly so i can hear them about um interesting

21:48.160 --> 21:53.520
stuff kind of like what you're just saying yeah so all right so the ps vita took up most of your day

21:53.520 --> 21:56.880
but you were you were happy with it at the end of the day what else were you able to get your hands

21:56.880 --> 22:04.320
on today um i got to play child of eden um which was definitely not totally what i was expecting

22:04.320 --> 22:11.280
but i still really liked it um the control scheme's a little weird and it was a guy the guy that was

22:11.280 --> 22:19.840
explained to me a wasn't from ubisoft b was from walmart and c you look at b again and realize the

22:19.840 --> 22:25.360
amount of knowledge you probably had about the game um he didn't really tell me how to play

22:25.360 --> 22:33.600
properly i don't think so it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing but it felt a lot

22:33.600 --> 22:41.760
like rez it looked like rez it sounded like rez um but the two firing mechanisms are different like

22:41.760 --> 22:49.360
your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on like these pinkish um enemies and your

22:49.360 --> 22:56.400
right hand is your lock on gun gun and i couldn't tell if i was supposed to like lock on fully and

22:56.400 --> 23:01.760
then like swing my hands forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot i think i had to

23:01.760 --> 23:07.280
point my hand forward but i definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die

23:07.280 --> 23:13.200
so it didn't matter and the music was really good i imagine uh what little i could hear yeah because

23:13.200 --> 23:19.760
if this one was outside underneath the tent oh lord which is of course the optimal playing uh

23:19.760 --> 23:25.360
you know environment for a music game and a connect game they must have been at that booth

23:25.360 --> 23:30.960
where i think rock of the dead was shown last year and it was not a great location there's amongst

23:30.960 --> 23:35.440
all you know you want what that booth was that booth was where a long time ago i think you were

23:35.440 --> 23:41.120
there for the c3 where they have the balls tent set up i don't even think i remember that but

23:41.120 --> 23:45.920
that's all right it's been a long time that's like not even on convention grounds it's across the

23:45.920 --> 23:51.200
street oh geez oh oh god okay you were like you weren't even in the convention center at that

23:51.200 --> 23:55.840
point yeah that's when i was walking there this morning and then they're like hey do you want to

23:55.840 --> 23:59.760
come play some games we got brinks i was like no no i can't try out the theater it's like yep let's

23:59.760 --> 24:05.200
go over there because i i still haven't found it on the show floor and i've been looking it's

24:05.200 --> 24:09.040
probably not there because it's out like what next week so i don't think there's a lot more to

24:09.040 --> 24:14.880
say about it so all right well what else did you use hands on um i didn't get my hands on it but i

24:14.880 --> 24:21.520
did get to sit through the presentation for saint throw the third um and that was pretty funny i've

24:21.520 --> 24:27.120
never liked open world games and i don't like gta or anything like that so i just kind of went in

24:27.120 --> 24:32.560
with an open mind and that game looks freaking hilarious and they didn't censor the the dildo

24:32.560 --> 24:37.520
bat thing that they hit people with that was really funny and they also said that you can make

24:37.520 --> 24:42.400
your character naked in play i was like how is this going to get an m rating at that point

24:44.160 --> 24:49.680
unless they're like built like a barbie doll naked naked to them might mean like booty shorts

24:49.680 --> 24:56.720
you know it might be like just nothing but you know well so my male character i'd make would

24:56.720 --> 25:01.440
have beauty shorts i guess that's your i i don't know if you just heard damn but la noir i don't

25:01.440 --> 25:07.120
know if you play that that got an m rating and that's got full-on beaver so totally oh yeah

25:07.120 --> 25:12.160
i don't know i haven't i i've got it i haven't finished it yet or even some clothes spoiler

25:12.160 --> 25:18.880
well i guess yeah i guess if it's not like an actual fashion it won't get anything bad but

25:18.880 --> 25:24.160
um that was really funny uh i liked what i saw they showed up off some open world stuff which

25:24.160 --> 25:30.560
was just humorous and then um like you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them

25:30.560 --> 25:37.760
out and everybody loves you because uh you're you're getting the things are like like celebrities so

25:37.760 --> 25:42.080
no matter what you do they like you so you put them in a cannon you shoot them out at things and

25:42.080 --> 25:47.520
you know they die and people are all excited because they're meeting you um this is gonna be

25:47.520 --> 25:53.200
a totally obscure reference but this reminds me of um one of the movies that stars divine if you uh

25:53.200 --> 25:57.280
know who divine is i think it's female trouble or something and you know it's always she's very

25:57.280 --> 26:01.760
filthy and over the top and stuff and there's a scene where she's like who wants to die for art

26:01.760 --> 26:05.520
and everybody's like me me me and so she shoots one of them and i don't know why but what you're

26:05.520 --> 26:10.560
describing sounds to me like that but that's the over the top craziness is what they're going for

26:10.560 --> 26:16.240
in this game so they've succeeded yeah definitely um and then they showed a mission which they were

26:16.240 --> 26:22.720
uh robbing a bank and it turned out to be like you know some rival gangs bank or whatever so

26:22.720 --> 26:29.120
fighting ensued and at one point during the gunfight which was really gory too um just

26:29.120 --> 26:33.200
some random person in the hood he came up and asked for your autograph and you get like extra

26:33.200 --> 26:40.480
points if you sign it i was like that's hilarious awesome um so is this even though you don't play

26:40.480 --> 26:45.280
the gta style games it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one yeah i might try

26:45.280 --> 26:50.000
this one this one looks really funny so i mean that's one thing about grandpa does it takes

26:50.000 --> 26:57.040
itself pretty seriously and i don't know this just seems like like kind of like smoking aces

26:57.040 --> 27:03.120
that would be or was it lucky number seven i don't know no that's broken aces yeah i'm not

27:03.120 --> 27:09.520
looking over seven um but that's really all i got to play today i think like i'm racking my

27:09.520 --> 27:17.120
my brain but the vita took up so much time that i don't think there was much else for today all

27:17.120 --> 27:22.320
right so uh uh anything you're gonna try to look at tomorrow i mean i know we're not doing a show

27:22.320 --> 27:28.240
tomorrow but anything you might want to look at i was debating on doing the wee or not and i think

27:28.240 --> 27:34.320
my final decision is i'm not gonna go to it because i don't think it's worth the time um

27:35.440 --> 27:40.240
so i think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like i'm gonna go try to do uncharted 3 because

27:40.240 --> 27:45.280
you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing uncharted 3 i'm gonna go back through the 3ds

27:45.280 --> 27:50.480
lines because you get pins um when you play the games and i want more pins because it's swag

27:50.480 --> 27:54.880
and i and risen heaven is there for the we and i haven't got to play it yet and i really want

27:54.880 --> 27:59.920
to do that because i like rhythm heaven so i might just hang out in the we and sony tomorrow and

27:59.920 --> 28:05.200
just completely avoid the other hall because i mean most of the cool stuff is either behind

28:05.200 --> 28:11.920
closed doors or just in video form so you're kind of finding the uh usual e3 thing that seems to be

28:11.920 --> 28:15.600
more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind

28:15.600 --> 28:20.880
closed doors and there's very little out there on the on the floor for the rest of you yeah yeah

28:20.880 --> 28:24.800
that's too bad i don't understand the the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look

28:24.800 --> 28:31.360
like it really changed anything i felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean

28:31.360 --> 28:37.040
like more stuff on the floor but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor like 2k and

28:37.040 --> 28:41.920
Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors i think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed

28:41.920 --> 28:48.240
doors ea has all all their good stuff behind closed doors huh wow i guess they just don't

28:48.240 --> 28:55.520
want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now so so and well cannot

28:55.520 --> 29:00.800
be needs to take that advice and you know hide like silent hill when they want because it's awful

29:00.800 --> 29:06.720
i tried it again today that's right and it was still bad so that whole day did not make a difference

29:06.720 --> 29:10.720
how funny i was just asked it's because dark soccer is very sad to hear that silent hill

29:10.720 --> 29:15.200
isn't very good i'm sad to hear it too but uh you need to try the alan wait game that's supposedly

29:15.200 --> 29:23.120
xbox where is that i would have or else i haven't seen it uh i think it's a microsoft boost somewhere

29:23.120 --> 29:28.160
unless it's uh behind closed doors like everything else i don't know oh let me just have to hear that

29:28.160 --> 29:32.400
hall again ask bobby he's in chat oh wait you're not in chat i was just asked bob bobby's in the

29:32.400 --> 29:37.440
chat room he might be able to tell you well maybe you can relay the message to me right now since

29:37.440 --> 29:44.640
we're live and you can read a chat room you will just have to do some research all right all right

29:44.640 --> 29:48.160
well uh me glitov thank you very much for uh joining us past couple days and giving us your

29:48.160 --> 29:51.440
thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor anything else you want to get out before

29:51.440 --> 29:59.680
we let you go no i ran to kira yeah kiriyama okra twice today why are you stalking him yeah i did

29:59.680 --> 30:05.280
another time i did not text you about because i was like at that point is it really worth it like

30:05.280 --> 30:10.560
it's like a daily occurrence now are you asking for his picture every time are you are you making

30:10.560 --> 30:17.120
eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows did you give him a hug he loves i've already given

30:17.120 --> 30:24.720
i've already given him like a side hug before no full-on manly pat on the back hug go for it

30:25.760 --> 30:30.560
and close your eyes you don't know what to do because christian side is really bad

30:32.320 --> 30:37.760
he what i missed that last part what did you say i said you only give christian side hugs

30:38.960 --> 30:44.720
yeah okay that's probably true oh i said uh every time i've gone up to him i keep you know

30:44.720 --> 30:49.280
realizing how bad his english is and he had like a translator chick with him today so it kind of

30:49.280 --> 30:55.520
helped but yeah it's kind of hard to talk to him and i don't think that me running up and trying

30:55.520 --> 31:06.400
to give him a hug would help you know break down that language barrier or anything fail

31:06.400 --> 31:13.920
yeah see you know saying dice he really long elongated because he would be running away

31:16.080 --> 31:17.120
why you no hug

31:20.000 --> 31:26.320
speaking broken english that's like i was thinking of the the little men

31:26.320 --> 31:33.200
main thing the so-and-so why you know this all right mijot we're gonna let you go uh i gotta

31:33.200 --> 31:39.520

34:33.440 --> 34:38.320
place i had picked i believe was that place where the sony press conference was held so after you

34:38.320 --> 34:44.960
said it took me 55 minutes in traffic to get there i'm like maybe that's not such a good idea so i

34:44.960 --> 34:48.880

there were heinekens no there were there were new castles and that's when i met new castles

35:19.840 --> 35:25.840

35:33.040 --> 35:37.040
was there but i mean it was so packed like i tried to go out and mingle and it was just like i'm

35:37.040 --> 35:41.040
going back to my table with electric sisterhood and i'm just gonna sit here and when they did

35:41.040 --> 35:46.160
karaoke we changed the lyrics to every single song to friday because that's for the journey

35:46.160 --> 35:51.280
song that was the only one we didn't turn into friday but everything else somehow became talking

35:51.280 --> 35:56.800
about friday and front seats and back seats and you know which which one do i take because that's

35:56.800 --> 36:02.240
what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer that's right beer thesda and we

36:02.240 --> 36:08.320
look if we look it was not a karaoke song or i would have sung it did ninja sister get on the

36:08.320 --> 36:14.880
bull no no no they didn't somebody one of the people from their crew did and he sang as well

36:14.880 --> 36:21.520
ah okay but uh neither of the sisters did all right all right well anyhow let's let's talk about

36:21.520 --> 36:26.800
your day at e3 today you got to actually get a little more of the games today because yesterday

36:26.800 --> 36:31.920
obviously your day was like all we you well not all but mostly right today you got to get a little

36:31.920 --> 36:36.000
more into some of the other games so what tell us about some of the stuff you got hands on with

36:36.000 --> 36:40.800
today i know i know skyrim was a big demo you got right you didn't you didn't get hands on but yeah

36:40.800 --> 36:46.160
right yeah it's a it was a demo and and some of the things i mean it it looks really nice

36:46.720 --> 36:54.400
um it crashed on us which is great um it crashed they're like hmm we need to do we need to switch

36:54.400 --> 36:59.760
something out until like the skyrim logo came up and he like did some stuff and flashed some

36:59.760 --> 37:04.880
things and then you know okay now we're continuing again out of curiosity did they tell you to shut

37:04.880 --> 37:09.840
off your video cameras did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo oh yeah yeah

37:09.840 --> 37:16.320
no no photos no video cameras um that one you could record audio like i could have recorded him

37:16.880 --> 37:22.800
speaking uh but yeah no video cameras or anything in defense of anything you know and um but it was

37:23.840 --> 37:27.440
sorry to answer something that came up when miklotov was on the show earlier that's why a

37:27.440 --> 37:31.840
lot of stuff is behind closed doors so they can take away cameras and things like that and not

37:31.840 --> 37:35.680
let you use them because of what just happened when when bobby was seeing skyrim is that when

37:35.680 --> 37:39.360
the game crashes then they don't want people running to youtube going look at this piece of

37:39.360 --> 37:45.200
shit game and how it crashes well i was gonna say though you remember when we got into bethesda

37:45.840 --> 37:50.240
um when we got the appointment with bethesda the first year and they just like go ahead and

37:50.240 --> 37:55.520
film star trek that's cool i think a star trek was was coming out soon i was filming call of

37:55.520 --> 38:00.160
cthulhu too all right they're just like please please film anything just just get it out there

38:00.720 --> 38:06.080
no now with the rise of camera phones yeah leaks are you know they're instant you know you're

38:06.080 --> 38:11.040
oh recorded oh it's on youtube and they just don't want to take that chance i understand sorry for

38:11.040 --> 38:15.600
the tangent bob and they were watching they were watching for people if they happen to be holding

38:15.600 --> 38:24.320
up a phone or something and they had tried to be discreet so now here was one thing is um you know

38:24.320 --> 38:29.680
a lot of people i heard a lot of people bitch about another rpg that came out a couple years

38:29.680 --> 38:35.200
ago uh that i played the sequel to today final fantasy 13 and why am i bringing that up in

38:35.200 --> 38:40.960
reference to siren because that whole chrysanthemum whatever it's called that's your skill system in

38:40.960 --> 38:49.840
skyrim interesting huh the way that you uh basically you unlock these constellations in

38:49.840 --> 38:54.720
the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where you get as

38:54.720 --> 38:58.480
you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and

38:58.480 --> 39:03.440
stuff like that that i mean it does like i looked at it i'm like that's final fantasy 13 right there

39:03.440 --> 39:09.040
wow and like people hated it in final fantasy 13 but they're probably gonna love it in skyrim

39:09.040 --> 39:14.480
of course of course double standards drive the gaming media what are you talking about

39:15.680 --> 39:19.520
yeah see i got it because i didn't bring this up last night the public is an idiot

39:19.520 --> 39:25.760
i think um because i i have heard so much like snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community

39:25.760 --> 39:30.400
about like everything like it's like you know sitting in the chat room during the press

39:30.400 --> 39:35.600
conferences like you think that you know microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage

39:36.400 --> 39:39.920
and gave you smell-o-vision so you could smell it at home because like they just

39:39.920 --> 39:45.360
hated everything they're like why don't all this stuff that connect oh modern warfare 3 i don't

39:45.360 --> 39:51.520
want to see modern warfare 3 oh oh it's another halo oh wah wah and you know and then like nintendo

39:51.520 --> 39:56.000
like hey this is like something you've never seen before i don't want that they don't want another

39:56.000 --> 40:01.680
mario you'll suck you know and it's like i mean there's a lot of people out there like dude if

40:01.680 --> 40:07.600
you don't you know i gaming may have moved on past you and you may need to just stop gaming if

40:07.600 --> 40:13.600
there's nothing that has been shown that you like you're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer i think

40:14.240 --> 40:18.240
and i've been seeing that a lot it's not here at the show floor like there's not that much hate

40:18.240 --> 40:23.680
here it's all the people at home i like that in the absence of loki tonight we get bobby doing

40:23.680 --> 40:28.240
the ranting that is not what i expect i thought it would be damn but we get bobby doing the ranting

40:28.240 --> 40:33.040
bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral i'm trying to let bobby

40:33.040 --> 40:37.120
rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out i think he knows what i

40:37.120 --> 40:43.440
think he's right on oh exactly all i can say is agree like times 10 likes this post people yeah

40:43.440 --> 40:51.120
exactly like people are idiots they just can't handle it it reggie hit it on the head you know

40:51.120 --> 40:55.520
and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it he's like look you guys want things

40:55.520 --> 41:00.080
that are different but you want something you're comfortable with fine we'll fucking do that we're

41:00.080 --> 41:07.760
nintendo it's what we do sony's just like whatever here's a better psp and uncharted microsoft's like

41:07.760 --> 41:12.240
connect and everybody's just like oh my god why can't there be something mind-blowing it's because

41:12.240 --> 41:17.440
the people are spoiled they got used to these blockbuster e3 announcements every year and now

41:17.440 --> 41:22.400
the blockbusters aren't good enough because the gaming companies got practically nothing left

41:22.400 --> 41:26.880
or they're just not willing to show it off yet do you think the microsoft thing

41:26.880 --> 41:33.360
might have come off a lot different if it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime

41:33.360 --> 41:40.080
yes halo 4 i think so too much much more important had everybody not i think gamer

41:40.080 --> 41:44.320
underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been honestly they should

41:44.320 --> 41:50.960
have led with halo 4 you think exactly all right anyway i don't want to recap the press conferences

41:50.960 --> 41:56.880
i gotta i gotta move forward here but um bobby skyrim was it as beautiful as it seems to look

41:56.880 --> 42:02.960
when i'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online yes and now i mean they probably souped it

42:02.960 --> 42:07.600
up a little bit it was running on a big movie screen uh but it looked and sounded beautiful

42:08.160 --> 42:12.640
um you know and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff

42:12.640 --> 42:19.360
like that does does it look like and then right go ahead yeah uh go ahead go ahead now i was gonna

42:19.360 --> 42:23.200
say does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into skyrim as you did with oblivion because

42:23.200 --> 42:31.040
oblivion you could easily sink triple digit hours into that game it was disgusting yes absolutely

42:31.040 --> 42:35.040
because they even showed like these they walked us through a town and like here's all the stuff

42:35.040 --> 42:39.440
you can do in the town and you could just go over here and chop wood you can do jobs like a table

42:39.440 --> 42:45.360
and you know all that stuff so there's you know lots of other side quests a lot other than the

42:45.360 --> 42:52.480
main story that they're packing in here and you know the the dragons are awesome just you know

42:52.480 --> 42:57.120
watching you know how they fly around and it's quick and you know all the stuff they're doing

42:57.120 --> 43:02.160
and and it's not like a you know pattern boss fight is what they they said they said they've

43:02.160 --> 43:08.560
got ai so no two dragon fights will be the same and even like our guy got you know hit around a

43:08.560 --> 43:14.880
couple times probably didn't expect so i mean they showed a couple different like two dragon

43:14.880 --> 43:20.080
player they showed dragon five we ran away from and then we met up with that dragon again and

43:20.080 --> 43:25.520
then a bigger dragon showed up and it was just you know here let me show you how you can do these

43:25.520 --> 43:31.360
spells and you know i do this and i can shout this at him and i'll use this fireball on him and

43:31.360 --> 43:35.680
you know injure him so he hits the ground and you know runs up to a castle to see if other people

43:35.680 --> 43:40.080
will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people it was awesome do you think it'll

43:40.080 --> 43:48.080
make the release date of 11 11 11 uh i believe they will it was i mean it was you know they

43:48.080 --> 43:52.160
showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and i think that they're in the

43:52.160 --> 43:58.880
polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing but um you know i i think

43:58.880 --> 44:03.680
they will i think they'll make that and um i i think people will be pleased with it now i mean

44:03.680 --> 44:09.360
the fez obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and uh games crash and stuff

44:09.360 --> 44:15.680
so i i would not be surprised if that's the case here um but you know they've done that and uh you

44:15.680 --> 44:20.320
know like all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things

44:20.320 --> 44:25.120
more exciting and seamless and stuff and you know they simplified the combat your the right triggers

44:25.120 --> 44:28.880
your right hand your left trigger your left hand whatever's in it that's what goes so you know

44:28.880 --> 44:34.080
there's your shield and you know your sword and stuff like that do the monsters still level do

44:34.080 --> 44:40.480
the monsters still level up with you they did not talk about that interesting but i i would assume

44:40.480 --> 44:48.960
that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that all right well so uh was

44:48.960 --> 44:54.640
that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else i went to see

44:54.640 --> 45:02.400
their prey to demonstration okay and and uh you know where you know it's alien noir is what they

45:02.400 --> 45:08.000
were calling it and stuff and and you know running around um basically in this game you play as the

45:08.000 --> 45:13.280
u.s marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so

45:13.280 --> 45:18.800
he you know you start off there and then you actually it fast forwards six months later to

45:18.800 --> 45:23.920
when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs oh i didn't

45:23.920 --> 45:26.960
realize that's how they were tying it together because when you see that trailer you're like

45:26.960 --> 45:33.520
what the hell does this have to do with prey yeah that was my literal reaction this looks awesome

45:33.520 --> 45:38.000
and i showed it to alan who loves that like cloverfield and and blair witch kind of stuff

45:38.000 --> 45:42.480
that's all and that's very much what the trailer is like right and it was like wow this is awesome

45:42.480 --> 45:49.040
it's it's it's prey yeah yeah so i mean basically and you do meet up with the character they did

45:49.040 --> 45:54.720
say spoiler alert you do meet up with the character from prey one eventually interesting story

45:54.720 --> 46:00.960
but basically you're you are uh a mercenary for hire because you used to be a u.s marshal so

46:00.960 --> 46:05.920
that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in prey one uh so he

46:05.920 --> 46:10.160
basically took those skills and now he's a mercenary a human mercenary on this on the

46:10.160 --> 46:15.600
home world of the alien and he's actually takes jobs for the aliens he can go through and help

46:15.600 --> 46:20.640
people or hurt people and he can corral people in and there's you know thugs will attack you as you

46:20.640 --> 46:27.200
go through it's a big open world thing on their alien planet so that that was kind of interesting

46:27.200 --> 46:34.480
and and uh you know i watched that until that crashed oh because he was like i need to go up

46:34.480 --> 46:38.960
to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going

46:38.960 --> 46:46.400
through the wall and then it just freezes so it sounds like uh that that would go ahead and then

46:46.400 --> 46:53.040
so that that was like and i'm like you know i've seen this it's cool i'm sold i'm gonna go check

46:53.040 --> 46:56.880
out something else because you know that was 15 minutes into the demo and i didn't know how long

46:56.880 --> 47:02.480
it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot so that's all i saw

47:02.480 --> 47:09.760
pretty too and then i uh since i don't like shooters i still went over to rage and the racing so i

47:09.760 --> 47:14.560
could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and i did the little three-lap race

47:15.280 --> 47:20.800
and stuff um but it's it's a very those enemies are a little cheap because it's i couldn't figure

47:20.800 --> 47:26.160
out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so i anytime i would get

47:26.160 --> 47:30.720
into third out of four anytime i got into third place i would immediately like blow up and there's

47:30.720 --> 47:34.080
nothing i could do about it like incoming i'm like okay what do i do okay i'll go around this corner

47:34.080 --> 47:40.160
oh it's a homing missile damn i'm blown up again at least you gave it the good old college try

47:41.200 --> 47:49.680
i did so um so yeah so i got to that's what i did in the Bethesda booth um and uh so i'm trying to

47:49.680 --> 47:55.200
think of what else i uh looked at and played today i mean i i went in and my other appointment was

47:55.200 --> 48:02.000
with ccp games and it was it was a powerpoint presentation uh with some videos embedded in

48:02.000 --> 48:06.640
about how they're going to be working dust 5.4 into eve online and essentially they were talking

48:06.640 --> 48:12.160
about their vision and the technology and it is it's really neat and i've learned the reason

48:12.160 --> 48:20.800
they're ps3 exclusive is because sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't

48:20.800 --> 48:28.800
do on psn and microsoft wouldn't do that dust 514 is a multiplayer only first-person shooter and it

48:28.800 --> 48:35.280
is running on the exact same servers of eve online as in you're going to be in the same corporation

48:35.840 --> 48:42.720
as eve online players you can transfer money and items between eve online and dust 514 basically

48:42.720 --> 48:46.880
dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet and eve online is the only way you can be in space

48:46.880 --> 48:52.960
wow and so and so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension

48:52.960 --> 49:01.120
of the wars in dust 514 and they will be fighting on the planet and yes i because i as you see this

49:01.120 --> 49:05.040
in the trailer and they're like yes this is exactly how it works the people playing dust

49:05.040 --> 49:10.960
514 can call up to the people playing eve online and orbit around the planet say i need an orbital

49:10.960 --> 49:15.840
strike i need a you know laser strike and the people playing eve can then call down

49:15.840 --> 49:22.080
this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something in the dust 514 multiplayer

49:22.080 --> 49:26.400
match going on at that same time that sounds awesome i've never played eve online in my life

49:26.400 --> 49:30.400
it's just not something that's really jumped out as something interesting to me but that sounds

49:30.400 --> 49:35.680
amazing like i i i love how the two different games tie together like that that sounds just

49:35.680 --> 49:44.400
awesome and dust 514 is tailored for first-person shooter fans who felt eve was too complex or out

49:44.400 --> 49:48.880
of their league a little bit you know they couldn't get into it but they still like the

49:48.880 --> 49:55.360
idea of being a part of this universe uh single shard server they said that they've had i think

49:55.360 --> 50:02.080
64 000 people concurrent is their record of how many people have played eve online at one time

50:02.640 --> 50:10.240
on one for her wow and and uh and also uh dust 514 it's going to be like a it's going to be a

50:10.240 --> 50:15.520
psn title downloadable uh 20 or 30 bucks i don't they didn't really pay the price it's somewhere

50:15.520 --> 50:20.160
around there so it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play there's no monthly fee

50:20.720 --> 50:25.440
oh wow and that money and the coverage they call it a cover charge is what they call buying the

50:25.440 --> 50:32.160
title and that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency so you start off with

50:33.040 --> 50:38.480
money already in your account which is basically the market value of what you just pay for that

50:38.480 --> 50:43.440
cover charge isn't that kind of how eve online works too i i i think you can buy like they

50:43.440 --> 50:49.040
support uh real money trade because they they they endorse it or they they do they monitor it

50:49.040 --> 50:56.560
they they provide it yeah well yeah well it's there's a monthly subscription for eve online

50:56.560 --> 51:01.840
but if you're good enough you can actually buy they're called plex pilot license extension cards

51:01.840 --> 51:07.760
in the game that gives you 30 more days oh right okay okay that's how and you can you know trade

51:07.760 --> 51:12.480
them in game and stuff like people and that's how you know some corporations will actually pay

51:12.480 --> 51:18.800
people to play the game for them by giving them plex wow and you you can do that so you know yeah

51:18.800 --> 51:23.520
so it's an amazing economy and they were even talking about you know some of the wars and stuff

51:23.520 --> 51:27.760
that have gone on and they even like actually referenced one of these player corporations in

51:27.760 --> 51:33.040
their trailer video where it was um i can't remember it might have been like the netherlands

51:33.040 --> 51:37.280
or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a russian corporation

51:37.280 --> 51:43.440
corporation in this one sector of space and you know the russians were out out out powering them

51:43.440 --> 51:49.280
and out maneuvering them and in stuff but the the the dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure

51:49.280 --> 51:54.240
out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations ccp had nothing to do with this

51:54.240 --> 51:59.280
espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the americans were funding the dutch

51:59.280 --> 52:04.800
because they didn't want to fight the russians directly so they cut off they cut off the trade

52:04.800 --> 52:09.840
route wiped out that dutch corporation and that was the end of it wow so it's stuff like that

52:09.840 --> 52:13.200
that they're you know because they say you know games like world of warcraft and everquest those

52:13.200 --> 52:18.080
are theme parks where there are quests given to you and you know it's the same thing every time

52:18.080 --> 52:24.160
and stuff like that eve online it's the sandbox they give you the fan the bucket you know the

52:24.160 --> 52:29.520
the area and you make the story and that's what they're saying that you know dust 514 is going

52:29.520 --> 52:34.720
to do with the same type of thing where you know and and the reason it's geographically like that

52:34.720 --> 52:39.520
is because of like time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that

52:39.520 --> 52:44.480
that's going to be the same way and they did say that uh for latency if you're worried about lags

52:44.480 --> 52:50.080
it's the first person shooter eve online is not you know it can handle latency uh the first person

52:50.080 --> 52:56.000
shooter they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll

52:56.000 --> 53:00.240
be connecting to that instead because their main eve online server cluster is in london

53:01.040 --> 53:06.560
so currently when you play eve online their supercomputer is in london and it's like they

53:06.560 --> 53:12.560
said like it weighs more than a ton but i think they said how many machines it was uh but they

53:12.560 --> 53:18.800
didn't i can't remember the number but they're going to have battle servers in uh geographic

53:18.800 --> 53:23.760
locations so you have a low ping you know when you're playing dust 514 because this most console

53:23.760 --> 53:31.040
games are peer-to-peer where one of the other ps3s is the server right in this the server is eve

53:31.040 --> 53:37.680
online and sony was the only one that allowed them to do that interesting and they also said that uh

53:37.680 --> 53:42.720
i asked you know you're you're infuriating a lot of pc players and stuff and they're like eve

53:42.720 --> 53:49.360
online's been around for over eight years you can read between the lines on that wow i feel like

53:49.360 --> 53:54.080
i've learned more about this game than anything else at e3 and like i i kind of just went no okay

53:54.080 --> 53:57.360
and it might tie into eve online that might be kind of cool but the way you describe it i'm like

53:57.360 --> 54:01.680
wow this this this almost makes me want to try eve online at least it sounds interesting yeah it

54:01.680 --> 54:06.880
sounds really interesting if they pull it off that's that's fast that's fascinating how the

54:06.880 --> 54:12.720
one game could impact the other like that so cool kai judo asks uh when can i get my hands on some

54:12.720 --> 54:17.760
stuff they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in

54:17.760 --> 54:22.160
the sense of it's going to go to the high end eve online players and you know hand-picked people

54:22.160 --> 54:27.600
but sometime next year uh but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside e

54:27.600 --> 54:32.960
for the last three years with their expansion uh like you know planetary building planetary

54:32.960 --> 54:37.520
formations and stuff like that you could build refineries on planet that started two years ago

54:37.520 --> 54:42.720
that was in preparation for dust and that in introduced some of the server aspects that would

54:42.720 --> 54:48.720
handle dust and you know stuff like that so it was i mean it was the reason i'm talking so much

54:48.720 --> 54:52.480
about it because they gave so much interesting technical information for me as a technical

54:52.480 --> 54:58.720
person as well um that you know it's just they didn't show the game like they didn't play the

54:58.720 --> 55:03.360
game they did with the powerpoint they showed some movies it wasn't even real like some of it was

55:03.360 --> 55:07.440
real gameplay footage but you know they didn't actually have a playable where they had a playable

55:07.440 --> 55:13.040
in other places before um you know they've just said you know we're talking about our philosophy

55:13.040 --> 55:18.160
and creating games and here's what we're trying to do and here's what we've already done and you

55:18.160 --> 55:23.200
know we're awesome and that's okay you got so much information about it that you're still a little

55:23.200 --> 55:27.440
hype for the game i mean at the end of the day it'll really be about well how does it you know

55:27.440 --> 55:32.800
how does it pull off because although it sounds awesome in theory like what if this breaks eve

55:32.800 --> 55:37.520
online you know like but these you know again like you said eve online has been around for

55:37.520 --> 55:43.360
eight years you know it may not be a quote-unquote competitor to wow but it's always been a great

55:43.360 --> 55:48.720
like alternative to wow but i just like i think of a game like star trek online which i played

55:48.720 --> 55:52.000
just a little bit during the beta but jamie you were really into and the thing with star trek

55:52.000 --> 55:57.440
online for me is that i loved the away team stuff but i did not like the space combat at all but

55:57.440 --> 56:01.760
like what if that was two separate games and like i could just play a game that's nothing but away

56:01.760 --> 56:05.840
team stuff i would have been all over that see it actually kind of got turned around for me that i

56:05.840 --> 56:11.440
liked the space see you could play eve i could play dust and we could still kind of be in that

56:11.440 --> 56:17.120
same universe that's always something i'd kind of wanted you know that you had your position i mean

56:18.400 --> 56:23.040
yeah it's a little different with star trek but i think that i get the thing it would be really cool

56:24.960 --> 56:31.360
wow so interesting fascinating you don't get off the ship you're stuck there the most fascinating

56:31.360 --> 56:36.560
part of my day wow all right well i i don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions

56:36.560 --> 56:42.480
and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit okay well no i can and actually

56:42.480 --> 56:45.360
i got an interview with this guy because you know i was kind of walking around

56:45.920 --> 56:51.440
and i passed by nico's booth you know they make all those you know the the extra peripherals or

56:51.440 --> 56:56.720
whatever and i'm like usually i'm like eh it's nico all right this time i actually stopped and

56:56.720 --> 57:06.880
looked and what they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people motion gaming

57:07.680 --> 57:14.480
it's called the zoom and what this does it's for the connect and it basically because connect

57:14.480 --> 57:18.400
fires out all these infrared lasers and that's how it determines the positioning it actually

57:18.400 --> 57:23.440
modifies where the lasers go and it gives it a wide angle lens so now you don't have to stand

57:23.440 --> 57:32.800
as far away from your tv nice so it basically instead of being six to eight feet away you can

57:32.800 --> 57:42.080
now be four to six feet away and two players of connect adventures can be you know stand kind of

57:42.080 --> 57:48.560
where one player would stand before and it seemed it worked pretty well from what i was seeing on

57:48.560 --> 57:52.800
there so i have a little i have an interview with a guy talking about that and uh you know how much

57:52.800 --> 57:58.880
it's going to cost which it's not that expensive it's only 30 bucks and it's coming out in august

57:58.880 --> 58:02.320
that could be great for those of us that live in like apartments and things where we're a little

58:02.320 --> 58:07.280
more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do that sounds great or not not

58:07.280 --> 58:10.400
want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play connect i think that's that sounds

58:10.400 --> 58:15.520
like it could be an awesome peripheral you know if it works but it it seems like if you were watching

58:15.520 --> 58:20.480
people play it at e3 that were they're normal people playing it right not not all their people

58:20.480 --> 58:25.520
right it's you could have i could have walked up and played it nice you just didn't want anyone

58:25.520 --> 58:35.920
to get that on video yeah so uh but um let's see what else did i um i did play uh final fantasy 13

58:35.920 --> 58:41.920
too how was that and i don't know if i don't know if shane talked about that or not uh it is uh

58:41.920 --> 58:52.240
uh it is uh final fantasy 13 plus shamu because of the with the quick time events and stuff um

58:52.240 --> 58:58.080
and and it built some uh other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open

58:59.040 --> 59:04.160
uh no open-ended and stuff you can you know because like final fantasy 13 it gave me that

59:04.160 --> 59:08.880
sense of urgency of the linearity of it and stuff and then when you get more as urgent then you

59:08.880 --> 59:13.520
could roam around well that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in 13 too

59:13.520 --> 59:20.240
you know i let you know go ahead yeah i was just saying i looked at the trailer for 13 too online

59:20.240 --> 59:24.880
and uh i did notice it seemed like they were emphasizing even in the trailer that there was

59:24.880 --> 59:29.360
more open world and open environments you could see in the maps they were not linear so i mean

59:29.360 --> 59:34.320
that was one of the biggest you know complaints about 13 so i i could that was one thing i noticed

59:34.320 --> 59:40.560
right off the top yep and uh one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my

59:40.560 --> 59:47.440
party so i had i had a monster in my party i had my two humans and then like this monster suddenly

59:47.440 --> 59:50.880
was in my party i don't know why it was you know i couldn't hear anything so i didn't know if it

59:50.880 --> 59:56.160
was explaining dialogue but uh you know so and it depending on what paradigm you were in that

59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.960
monster change like he was a little fire plant in commando mode or when you turn him to ravager he

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.120
turned into this big server thing huh so it was it was that was kind of cool and they introduced

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.360
this um and i didn't really understand it all that much once again because i was on the show floor

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.400
uh but it's like you've got a little mod with you and when enemies appear a little countdown timer

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.400
appears and however quick you hit the enemy uh that you know that determines if you get this

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.960
first hit or if they hit you first or whatever uh that was kind of interesting and then they did

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.000
some of like these cinematic events and live events and stuff uh while you're just walking

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.560
around and you know you can still walk around and like the camera will change to show something

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:47.040
happening hmm so it was kind of cool um you know i'm you know i'm sold on it but you also like 13

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.680
right what you also like 13 and a lot of you also like 13 though right and a lot of people didn't

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.720
yes i like 13 so you know you keep that in mind when i say that that i you know since i like 13

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.840
you know i like 32 i like what they added to it but it is you know the core gameplay of the

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.560
paradigm shifting all that stuff that's that's still there 13 it didn't change at least not what

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:16.160
i saw um do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:26.000
oh no haters are gonna hate all right sounds familiar gamershateeverything.com right that's

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.160
right okay exactly um so let's see i'm trying to think of what else i kind of walked by and got to

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:41.760
see it was i was running around and stuff um i did go into atlas's booth a little bit in the

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.840
little meeting room area that was open so i could get into it um and they were showing uh rock of

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:54.720
ages which is the only one rock of ages and they were showing catherine and they were talking about

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.040
other things but those were kind of the only ones they were showing um and i played rock of ages and

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.840
i'm it was it's kind of hard the thing about e3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.840
they dump you in the middle of things and there's not always a tutorial and there's not always a guy

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.880
standing there telling you okay here's what's going on so i had no clue what i was doing it's

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.280
like it's a tower defense game and then it's katamari damasi but not really because it's not

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.280
tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was it was kind of

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.200
interesting i'm sure that i'd like it more if i played it you know knowing what i was doing

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.640
but um that one was kind of cool i didn't you know there was too many people for catherine

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:43.040
in the place was getting cramped so i didn't get to go in there um so uh trying to think of what

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:50.320
else did you do you remember seeing anything on my twitter that i've been missing no i i mostly

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.480
wanted to hear about skyrim though but that you were getting some feedback on twitter today any

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.960
good uh any good questions you were able to get answered for people on twitter at twitter.com

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.960
slash bobby blackwolf i i did i started answering questions and then loki actually answered them

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.760
better than i did because like they weren't they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like oh

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:17.600
no that's coming out on february 12th um one thing i didn't get to play this yet um but uh you know

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.920
a good colleague of mine shadow next gen he's actually sitting right across from me right now

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:29.520
howdy um he he was uh able to get in to see the demo of fable the journey oh we learned something

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:36.560
but not many people are talking about what's that the game is not on rails oh it sure looked like it

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.440
was on rails okay okay it sure looked like it but according to mr molyneux who apparently gave that

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.720
particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do he said it's not on rails and you

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.480
know you can believe everything that molyneux says yeah it's always dead on accurate not not over

01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.600
hyped at all so okay well then maybe maybe we'll just need to see more videos of the game in actual

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.040
well i wonder how do you move around yet you have the connect thing going on that's why i always

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.320
assumed a lot of connect stuff was on rails because like well if i'm not holding a controller

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.320
but i i also kind of thought connect was supposed to allow me to sit my big butt on the couch

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.920
with my controller yeah and maybe i'll maybe i'll lift my hand and wave it for something you know or

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:29.520
or at some point it could actually see fingers i don't know yeah now the game i did play today and

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.680
this is the reason i forgot about this because it was the first one i did this morning i went

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.200
to disneyland already i've already been to disney you went to play disneyland adventures huh

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.040
i did i played connect adventures with disney characters and that one the way the way that

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.520
you move in that and it's kind of interesting funny like in the overworld the the disneyland

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.600
area they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tabled like the little yellow

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.560
circles around things um but the way you move on that is you just put your hand down and you

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.800
start moving and then if you go right and left that's how you turn your character um and i did

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:12.720
an alice in wonderland video or mini game and uh it was um you remember the whitewater raft rafting

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:20.720
thing that was in connect adventures yes yeah it's that it's that with alice in wonderland characters

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.320
um so it basically you know when you guys are saying it's connect adventure with disney that's

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.840
pretty much what it is also i guess to me like i didn't get to do the the peter pan one but it's

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.160
been a while since i've been there but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride at least i

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:43.600
hope the alice in wonderland ride is not you in a golf in a golf ball with alice hitting you and

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.760
sending you down and all these cards are trying to you know get in your way and you have to jump

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.560
over them i can guarantee you the ride is not like bobbie you will not have to worry if we do end up

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.080
going on that ride on friday we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.640
experience because we are going for research purposes that's only on it's a small world at

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.880
least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it when a small world breaks down the

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:13.760
puppets start pelting oh i've been in there when it during christmas all those people are actually

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.080
people who are trapped inside of the ride when it broke down and they were turned into little

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:26.720
mannequins and then you sing forever so was it was it enough to make you go gosh i i might actually

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.640
kind of want to get this game or were you like nah this is just the same crap with a new label

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.440
i i said gosh i might want to put this game on my gamefly queue

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:41.920

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:52.560
yeah fair enough yeah um so other than that i'm really i mean i talked to the playstation home

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.800
developers a little bit oh uh and i'm probably going to be doing an interview with them because

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.840
blender uh asked me about you know because there's this big freezing bug and they you know you

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.920
i was talking to people that actually work on i think content creation stuff but they were like

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:11.040
yeah we addressed that finally like this you know yesterday and you know blah blah blah and they

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.840
have like things that they want people to do if they encounter like we want this far

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.080
wide i'm like so you want to go on the air about that and they're like oh i'd love to

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.160
but i got to talk to pr so i may have this huge ps home interview tomorrow i'm soliciting questions

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.400
on twitter tonight some people have sent me some real good ones wow but i may be able to

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.640
report an interview there i know there's a lot of questions people have about playstation home

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:45.120
like when's it getting out of beta is it a google product yeah so um i think it's all data didn't

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.080
they take the word beta out of home no no when i launched it earlier today or not uh last night

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.000
you know how i went into playstation home it was completely on accident i met to go i meant to go

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.520
in the store and i accidentally like because my thumbs are fat like fred flintstone i went up and

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.240
i went into playstation home instead and i was like well shit now that i launched this i might

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.880
as well just kind of look around i clearly noticed the beta tag still on it and i was like hasn't

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:18.480
this been around for like two years now at least so uh and then uh i did kind of walk through the

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:26.080
indicate booth which is all the independent games where they had nerd twister as an actual twister

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:34.720
with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot on what color but the way that they

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:42.960
did it it's it's the i think they call it twister anapolis 5000 it's a race so everybody starts at

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.280
the end and i posted a picture of this on twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.160
starts one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:59.040
hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.440
without leaving one of their you know without waving one of your other hands uh they declared

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:11.280
the winner so that that was interesting and they had something else like what they had like it

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.000
looked like a four square court but i couldn't like they were throwing cups or something i don't

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.960
know what that was but i also saw in there i was just saying because the twister but the twister

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.920
was nerd twister what happened is that when you got to the very end the mat was pulled away and

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:34.880
you all fall into a cologne bath and that's how they kept e3 sane now that was not the craziest

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:41.040
thing that i saw in the indicator oh dear okay and i was i wanted to get a picture of this but

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:46.720
by the time i thought about getting the picture of it uh they were not playing it anymore it is

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:57.120
called a kiss controller a what where a kiss controller okay as in i thought he said a little

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.720
device you kiss this little device and that actually like they were shown like it does a

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:11.520
bowling game and the better kissers you are the better you bowl and you're actually kissing this

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.160
it is i i didn't want to approach it because i didn't want to you do it myself i wanted to

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:22.160
get a picture of somebody else doing it interesting wow they were putting those

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:28.960
booth babes to work weren't they i was like and there was this other game that had like a gas

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.120
mask and i didn't know what that was i don't know what that was but the guy was wearing like a full

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.280
on gas mask and playing you know might have been like some virtual reality type of thing as well

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.840
but it also tried to breathing or something i don't know maybe that was just to protect him

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.640
from the fanboy wink this clearly would have been the type of thing that used to be in kensha hall

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.520
yes awesome yeah that this stuff that stuff would have been intention because i mean the

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.040
indicate stuff so it was a lot of the independent games and stuff and then they had normal games in

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.480
there too that those were like on the edges you know that was the oh i've never thought of that

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:11.120
before well now bobby i know you've got one more day left at e3 and i know as part of your day

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.240

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.480
considering trying to get in the line for the vita but if it's really longer than the wii uu line

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:22.320
i think i'm gonna skip on that yeah miklotov waited four hours today so take it or leave it

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.720
i guess and he said it was worth it but of course then he continued to say i'm not waiting in that

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:36.640
wii u line so i don't know yeah yeah so so i don't know i may or may not do that i don't think so i

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.200
nearly the turnout tonight live that we did last night i think a lot of that is that you know most

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.480
of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences so maybe you're

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.960
it's kind of out of your system at this point but i don't know if it's open if anyone does want to

01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.400
call us give us a call again it's 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:07.200
um well we just actually had a facebook post by naoki oh what did naoki say on uh facebook hot

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:13.520
news the guy who is behind uh he's a music producer of ddr recently right the 2011s new

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.040
ddr has been announced for we its name is dance dance revolution 2 its title concept is back to

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.160
basic the originality of ddr is the part where you play with your feet we have concentrated on that

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.000
part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional ddr ps not

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.680
only for the casual fans but we consider this title will be something that could be enjoyed by

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.880
core ddr fans for a long period of time as well we are aiming for the release of the title for this

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.520
fall we will do our best to respond to your expectations so please look forward for it

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.560
very interesting so now keep saying the ddr 2 on the we is going back to basics it basically

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.360
without saying it none of this balance board and flinging the wiimote around gimmicky shit he's

01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:01.440
saying it is back to feet because that's what makes back to the feet sure forget it is it a

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:10.240
new feature har where's my sad trombone i don't have a soundboard right now so dude you guys

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:16.720
harmonize that was awesome all right well some of the other stories i have just to go over quickly

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.520
some of these have developed in the pastio day or so uh that we didn't get got i feel like with

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.000
bobby's little like dust thing i was like god i learned more about that than i've read anywhere

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
or heard anything that was great but uh talking quickly about some of the other things that have

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.360
come up uh just in the past 24 hours a lot of it has to do with nintendo i don't know if you guys

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.320
heard about this and what you guys think make of this nintendo stock apparently went down five

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.120
percent yesterday after the wii u was revealed and my question you guys do you think that's a

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.480
big deal it was right after the keynote uh it went down to sixteen thousand nine hundred seventy yen

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:54.880
that's roughly 212 dollars but that is down five percent a low that the company has not seen since

01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:02.240
before the launch of the original wii is this damning for them or is this eh whatever i think

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.560
is people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but but if i'm not mistaken

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.880
most of the gamers i'm seeing posting on twitter i mean no offense guys but i don't think it's the

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.520
same people that are that are are following the uh japanese stock exchange or having a lot of

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.080
impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on hold on i won't go that

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.240
far i'm sure people have investments in things but it's a knee-jerk reaction you know the the

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:33.120
stockholders gauged what they thought the public reaction was it wasn't like oh my god it's the

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.920
second coming nintendo quick take our money except for a few people who were like take our money

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:46.080
i wasn't like that but i'll buy one so it dipped it's five percent i mean that's a significant drop

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.880
but over the next you know what year and a half two years demand will build nintendo will make

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.560
it happen they'll announce a price i think right now everyone's worried that this thing has to be

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.600
expensive they'll announce a price it'll be reasonable they'll sell a hajillion of them

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.880
nintendo stock will be a hundred gazillion dollars and everything will be fine for nintendo and more

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.280
fictional amounts well you know uh one thing that i did read about price is that even though

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.680
nintendo has not said anything i guess there's been hints from things like you know conversations

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.160
with executives indirect it will not be out for 250 oh no so we're looking at least probably

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:28.000
299 for this thing if not maybe even jumping up 349 or something well with all the competition

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:37.360
you know out there at what is it sub 200 now for a 360 oh yeah and and 200 bucks for the top end

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:46.880
360 or ps3 you gotta wonder how far nintendo can push that without seeing the uh the competition

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:51.920
gets some some bump from it uh now speaking of stock and i wanted to mention this but i'll let

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:59.040
the chatters say it because uh they said it too chat.org.com zappy says stocks fluctuate not a big

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:04.320
deal apple went down too after worldwide developer conference that's that's the first thing in my mind

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.360
is that well don't these things usually dip after apple press conferences and especially when all

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.600
the stuff happened with the antenna you know and their little apology press conference they did

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.160
with that i'm sure stock dips for them a lot too but they they're apple and they're still doing

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.280
just fine all these years later yeah they're making a couple bucks just a couple bucks not

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.600
doing too bad now several people in chat have mentioned this and uh black wolf's now saying

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.280
he's in chat now kind of cooling off with the listeners they're talking to them uh did you

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.600
guys cover that nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes i had not heard that until

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.280
i walked into studio somebody posted it in chat earlier but apparently nintendo will be ditching

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:48.000
friend codes for the wii u good finally applause good job that's one way to get the hardcore gamer

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.160
base back that's smart i wonder if they've said much more about online let me look tiger claws

01:22:54.160 --> 01:23:07.280
giving us a little link here so we can take a peek let's see i'm going right now to this story

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:13.600
at mtv multiplayer blog because nintendo or mtv is all about the video games i know what's that

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.000
about actually i hear i don't read a whole lot of these big blogs but i hear the mtv ones pretty

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.320
good i just i don't have time there's the knees in action well yeah that's the whole super mario

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:29.040
brothers me yeah they were talking about i think it's cute let's see um on hand at e3 ubisoft

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.560
producer adrian blunt according to him the day of friend codes are gone demonstrating ghost recon

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:42.800
online for the wii u um i asked him equivalent to a gamer tag on xbox live yeah exactly he said uh

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.520
what else is there there's a few things on that the first is the ability for individuals to make

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.240
accounts rather than a machine having an account each individual user has an account so

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:58.400
that's an account uh he continued saying also the ability to easily find friends rather than using

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.720
friend codes which we've had in the past we're able to connect players in a much easier way

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.360
which allows us to have a community that's playing together in the game blunt wasn't willing to get

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.200
more specific about the online functionality you know what that sounds like to me remember a couple

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.240
weeks ago on the show we were speculating that the system tied into facebook somehow i don't

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.120
like exactly facebook but i bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.480
some type of maybe that's where the nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the nintendo stream

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.720
is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing super mario we and so and so

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.440
just got caught and catch me i see dan laughing over there you think i'm full of it or oh no no i

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.120
was laughing about the fact that nintendo has products called the we and the stream

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.520
but now now that i think about it hearing that i'm like oh the nintendo stream that would make

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.880
perfect sense it's like you know funny it's what aol aol calls it the live stream right there um

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:59.040
updates and stuff yeah yeah so now you can make a stream which i don't use of course i'm i'm

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.280
obviously the nintendo stream thing was like total fanboy wank speculation i don't think there was a

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:09.040
lot to back that up but i'm just having fun with the what ifs but i i still think the facebook

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.960
concept of nintendo record i i got mildly curious and there are already a full page of search

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:22.160
results for weu fan pages uh tiger claw in our chat says i bet the gamer tag thing nintendo

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.520
has coming is tied to your club nintendo account your club nintendo account has a username that's

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:34.080
definitely possible um sure why not why not you have a database you own nintendo hardware there

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:42.080
you go well that sucks because i didn't get the name i wanted then bitches and frisbee says oh

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.840
shit more facebook like crap you know it's one of those things that could be done very well or very

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.720
crappy i mean how vague is that but seriously like i hear facebook i don't necessarily think that has

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.680
to be crap because i think a lot of us think of facebook crap as my feed filling up with come play

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:02.880
farm bill with me and you know and you can hide that crap and so and so filled out a survey and

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.840
said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no i do that too but it's just frustrating that

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.000
bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.640
a little better might be interesting i'm ignoring all those fucking people anyway

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.440
again the phones are open if you do want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.320
is orange lounge radio um if we don't get any calls i'll kind of close quote unquote with this

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:36.800
story the weu reel that was showing off some of the third-party games this has been igniting the

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.960
internet today is apparently using 360 and playstation 3 footage and a lot of people are

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.600
going fail nintendo oh nintendo why didn't you tell people this is 360 ps3 you're be it you're

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:57.520
lyin nintendo and uh i'm kind of thinking is this really a big deal like i can't believe like i kind

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:05.280
of figured it was pc or 360 footage because i don't know the system's a year away i know right

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.080
but they've got the licenses for it they've and keep in mind for all the third-party stuff it's

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.600
probably what they've been provided by the developers absolutely right absolutely right

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.240
and i bet a lot of these things were a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month a month

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:26.000
two months ago very short time yeah these games are concepts still i and i can tell you this just

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.080
okay and this is from designer when you're working for a client and you say okay well you

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.560
want your want me to advertise this product for you i need some of your images they will send you

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.640
what they have of the item they don't care how big it is they don't care what it originally was on

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.240
they're just sending you pictures of the item what you know their pr has approved so

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.640
you get you know you get what they give you whatever you're nintendo how stupid can you be

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.360
seriously it's i know exactly what you're saying i remember back in like the genesis days and the

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.760
atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.560
know it was the the screenshot of the best looking version but nintendo's out there to make a

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:16.320
statement nintendo's out there to say this is our system and this is what it could do okay fine do

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:22.960
what you got to do put the put the code on your pc mock-up of of the wii u and play the game and

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.520
hope that it runs and if it runs great put it on your video don't throw these pictures out into the

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:35.680
world and be like this is what our system will do and then like a day later be like oh by the way

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:43.360
yeah that that's that's the competition system no no at least don't admit it lie you're nintendo

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.840
you've lied before dungeon buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:53.600
what it could do right exactly i understand that i have a problem with that you have a problem with

01:28:53.600 --> 01:29:00.480
everything no i don't i'm not mad i have a problem with you yes of course you do i it it wasn't i

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.760
mean the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:13.360
conceptual video based on existing game footage or something you know something just to cover their

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.640
ass whatever but they didn't do that they put those pictures out there they put the pictures

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.040
especially you know the one the one game in there that really got a pop was when ninja guy den showed

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:26.480
up right and everybody was like oh fuck it's ninja guy den and it's on the wii u and it looks really

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:31.840
really cool yeah you should have known that was the ps3 version of the 360 version kids the one

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:37.520
that kind of left me like okay maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the ghost recon where they

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.000
were showing like the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.120
wii u controller as the scope like it just that's what it looked like to me but it was off in the

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:54.160
360 version of the ps3 version but if it's true about the guts of this machine it's gonna be

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.520
basically a 360 with some extra little frills maybe a boost in the ram a boost in the shading

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.960
graphical components of it and so forth i mean nintendo's going all in that their system has to

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:11.920
be at least as good as the 360 or the ps3 systems that have existed for five years now so i think

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.640
it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that absolutely it's going

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.680
to at least be this level of graphics this generation and that is why they showed they did

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.840
show that little you know for what it's worth that little random ass asian flower face

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:34.560
asian flower flying in the bird into the the the pool and everybody went shit what is that looks

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.640
really good that was the wii u that doesn't exist anywhere else well that was the wii u's

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:47.360
development system right so you know is is a high spec pc so and if and if i see okay well that's

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.240
capable then i'm sure they can pull off the 360 ps3 back in the day when the when the playstation

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:58.400
demo disc was out and it had all the ducks and you know all over the water and that t-rex and

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.560
the t-rex and when everyone's like oh wow that's neat how many games did we get that really look

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.760
like that until the end of the playstation's life true well right it's just that kind of thing you

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:13.600
know it's it's all it's so early people are people are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.560
that's a year and a half away and will change and will not be the same when it comes out it'll be

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.760
better it'll be better than the stuff that's out there now well it can't not be because you cannot

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:30.880
buy graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the ps3 and the 360 now it doesn't

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.960
exist they're gonna be better they're not gonna be next generation better they're going to be peak

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:43.680
of this generation better that's how nintendo rolls it's a bridge i didn't you know this whole

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:50.400
like generation to generation nintendo has basically said with this that they they're

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.800
not following that rule they're just following what the markets want or what have you

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:05.760
what was that uh from the chat room colibri for yeah that was me that was jamie um i i kind of

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:11.600
though one of the fears that i have is that it's gonna pull a dreamcast that since it's coming out

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.480
well before other systems of uh of this nature

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.160
do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot no because it's

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.840
nintendo and sega only ever really had sonic you know i mean and i'm saying like as far as like

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.160
catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth i mean if nintendo's launching with

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.400
the smash brothers game they got nothing to worry about nintendo's not launching with the smash

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:46.480
brothers game it won't be out until that system's uh first holiday season interesting which will be

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.520
the season i think the only system that ever launched with the smash brothers game at least

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.880
close to launched was the cube right which by the way we found out today you won't be playing that

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.600
on the wii u because the wii u has taken out the game cube compatibility that's right i you know

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.120
what we've got a game cube don't care i know i'm kind of like that i'm not too surprised about

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.680
that because nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back it's kind of like

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:13.360
your ds your ds 3ds or whatever won't play gameboy advance games you know they took that out way back

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:20.640
in the dsi right yeah right yeah so i mean that however our ps3 will play ps1 games

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.040
you couldn't play gameboy games on your ds even though the slot was the same size your ps3 will

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:34.800
play atari 2600 games it's not even the same company it's amazing all right well i guess

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.560
everybody's being shy tonight we're not getting any calls that's okay what's up with that people

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:44.240

to file divorce from nintendo oh my gosh somebody called judge mabel why do you make nintendo hit

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:33.440
you ronma after that presentation and my friends going nuts on twitter about about their pre

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:40.080
about their presser we kind of came to agreement that nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.920
always take back just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around there

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.200
is genuine concern in the chat room what will happen to black luigi he will be replaced by

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:57.280
shadow the hedgehog oh my god that's trading down really really really far

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:06.240
and i'm a sega fan my shadow really at least be knuckles

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:13.040
dan if it's any consideration is this a black thing when i walk into a block brother stay

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:19.520
black let him talk look dan if it makes you feel any better joe vidya will kick my ass

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:25.440
when she sees me dressed as shadow because she is not a shadow fangirl well she's more of a sonic

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.040
and tails fangirl joe vidya three more times for the rest of us all right uh i i gotta talk more

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.840
about why why this nintendo hatred what about when i i have to admit i loved it when reggie

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:43.120
came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:53.280
you guys are confusing but here i don't know what gamers he's listening to but i didn't ask for a a

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.840
six-inch android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side i had one of those

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.120
i just want one of those as a system you don't want to put it on your table and play othello

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:14.000
no that would be awesome like ben heck to make it what about though the fact though rama that

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.520
we are still a year away i mean the reason why i'm i'm still kind of like it was all right their

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.560
presentation was fine i'm not like super excited about it i'm gonna buy one anyway because i'm a

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:30.080
consumer whore and i buy them all and help but i'm like we're not really gonna see this system

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:36.240
for another year maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together so are you basically

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:44.240
giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out i suppose so but it's okay because

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:52.160
i will be i will be marrying its younger sister the 3ds ah so the 3ds you were a fan of all the

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:59.040
stuff you saw there okay yes uh mario kart yes even i am a mario kart whore like nobody else's

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.840
business that that's a given and i missed super mario but i went back and watched a trailer for

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:12.640
it and i said this is the mario game i've been looking for a 3d platformer that plays like 2d

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.440
but it's three this is what i wanted right i will sit here and play that i'm not too fond it's

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:25.200
called super mario but hey whatever i think it might still be a working title so it seems so it

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.720
seems to me that you've got this uh relationship with the big sister but really you just want to

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:38.880
sleep with the little sister well well yeah that's why i have a ds okay wow all right

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:46.000
well rama any other closing thoughts on e3 before we let you go uh let's see then microsoft was a

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.520
bit of a snore sony had me with with the vita and i'll say this right now yes the vita with 3g

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.960
powered by at&t it's gonna be 299 but i'm telling you when it comes out you'll be able to get it

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:07.040
for 99.99 with a two-year contract mark my word that's not that's not how they sell ipads though

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.520
that's how they sell iphones ipads iphones netbooks with 3g hell it worked for the taco

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.880
didn't it well kind of yeah but we got ours for free i think this is a relevant question

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.640
rama since you are black luigi and we call you that just so people know we call you that because

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.880
whenever you you you cosplay and you're black and you you dress up as luigi you make your way

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.000
on camera no matter who's there and we always see you on tv oh it's black luigi there he is

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:40.000
that's why you have that name and so tiger klon chat says rama what do you think of luigi's

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.160
mansion too since you know it's a game starring luigi nintendo finally showing some luigi love

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:51.680
i'm all for it because you know i've always said this i've always said that

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:57.360
peach is nothing more than a than a whore because mario's always chasing after her to save her

01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:04.960
she doesn't freak out when bowser kidnaps her you know happens three times a month i know and look

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:10.720
they're a coupe of kids we all know who the mother is you know we already know i feel like you have

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:17.920
designed this really weird sick mario rp world while really really fucking high

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:24.240
i actually i was so brett the time it was very loose and i said this to a friend of mine

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:28.400
and it broke him and all my other friends are like holy shit that actually makes sense

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:36.720
bowser you are the father all right anyway look luigi has a nice mansion

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.960
a nice car his girl is in check he's got the good life i mean really

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:50.240
but really luigi's mansion a 10 year old game coming back you're all for it yeah i actually

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.760
believe it or not i actually liked the first luigi's mansion i thought it was a fun game

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.560
hey i think it's a neat hey rama princess daisy don't want no scrub

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.080
dad she has an eyeball in the back of her head all right rama we're gonna let you go

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:13.040

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.920
