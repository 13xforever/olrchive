0	19840	Tonight, June 7th, 2011, we kick off our live E3 coverage with press conference reactions
19840	31800	and special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miek LaTov in LA on the show floor.
31800	35520	Hello my friends out there on the internet and happy E3 to you all.
35520	38320	I know there's been a lot of news this week.
38320	40360	Welcome to our special E3 coverage.
40360	43000	We're going to be live tonight and tomorrow night.
43000	46000	That's Tuesday and Wednesday, 7 o'clock Pacific.
46000	47000	Little different this week.
47000	49680	We're on Ustream, checking out a new place to stream the show.
49680	53440	To those of you that are brand new to Orange Lounge Radio, welcome.
53440	56640	If you found this through Ustream or what have you or some of the other referrals, which
56640	59440	we'll talk about in a little bit, welcome to our little show.
59440	65000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice and boy, here's a lot of voices about what's
65000	71160	been talked about from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, to Lezarec, Stadia and Ubisoft, but there's
71160	74560	just a lot, a lot of talk today and we're going to get right into it, but I need to
74560	76300	introduce everybody on the panel.
76300	79640	First off, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes known as Sky, and I'll be joining you with
79640	80680	my co-host.
80680	83320	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
83320	84320	Meaty.
84320	85320	How are you?
85320	86320	Meaty.
86320	87320	Feeling fresh and meaty.
87320	88320	Meaty.
88320	89320	All right.
89320	91200	And say hello to the one and only, and I'm so happy he can make it here tonight, Techmaster
91200	92200	Loki.
92200	93200	Hi.
93200	96560	We were a little worried that Techmaster Loki wouldn't be here tonight because of family
96560	98760	commitments, but here he is.
98760	99760	Screw the family.
99760	100760	No, just kidding.
100760	101760	I hope Nelly's not listening.
101760	102760	No, no, no.
102760	103760	All right, good.
103760	107920	Welcome to you, and we're going to ask you about Nintendo in just a little bit.
107920	110920	Also joining us, we've got other people joining us, we're going to have the one and only Bobby
110920	112680	Black Wolf from the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
112680	117240	He usually does a show right before us on our normal live shows Sunday night.
117240	122240	Of course, we're live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and more
122240	125200	information about all of that is at our website, orangesongsradio.com.
125200	128680	Bobby Black Wolf is in LA at E3.
128680	130840	He will be joining us momentarily to talk about it.
130840	132880	He has played the Wii U.
132880	134480	We're going to talk all about that in a little while.
134480	137240	I want to introduce somebody else here in studio, though.
137240	138240	Dan the Man is joining us.
138240	139240	Hello.
139240	140240	He's on the show tonight.
140240	141240	What a pleasant surprise.
141240	142240	How are you, Dan?
142240	143240	I'm good.
143240	144240	Awesome.
144240	145240	So, E3.
145240	149400	I wish I was there.
149400	151880	We're going to get into all of the press conferences and so forth.
151880	153000	Let me just start with this.
153000	157960	Before I plug everything and do the usual plugs, let me... What is one word on your
157960	166120	mind right now that if E3 right now can just boil down to one word, what is that word right
166120	167120	now?
167120	168120	Dan?
168120	169120	Underwhelming.
169120	170120	Underwhelming.
170120	171120	Loki?
171120	172120	Huh.
172120	173120	All right.
173120	174120	Dark Sakura.
174120	175120	What?
175120	176120	I'm going to say third party.
176120	177120	That's two words.
177120	178120	No.
178120	179120	Cheater.
179120	180120	All right.
180120	181120	Fine.
181120	182120	Third.
182120	183120	That's my word.
183120	184120	All right.
184120	190240	I want to also plug our chat room.
190240	192120	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
192120	195520	We will be taking your calls a little later in the show on our toll-free number as well
195520	198120	as Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, but not just yet.
198120	199700	We're going to get to that later in the show.
199700	203220	If you want to join our chat room, please note we do not have a Ustream chat.
203220	205320	We have an IRC chat room.
205320	211120	More information is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so please, by all means, pull up a chair,
211120	214400	sit in the chat room, and join us there.
214400	218560	Orange Right in the chat room, we'll start us off tonight, kind of all one word slammed
218560	222920	together says, third party saving first party asses.
222920	226200	I guess my runner up would be, seriously?
226200	228160	Oh, that's a good one.
228160	229720	Is it going to be all negative tonight?
229720	230720	Really?
230720	236680	Because I swear to God, all I've been reading on Twitter is just cynicism, skepticism, negativity,
236680	240760	and I'm like, this is why everybody hates gamers.
240760	246760	There's not an ounce of positivity I'm seeing on Twitter, but I don't feel 100% negative.
246760	248760	Are there things that I think should be done better?
248760	249760	Sure.
249760	250760	But is it all negative?
250760	251760	I don't necessarily think so.
251760	252760	But is anything mind-blowing?
252760	253760	No.
253760	260760	Yes, but probably not from any of the big five that we're going to talk about today.
260760	262760	I'll leave it at that.
262760	263760	All right.
263760	269400	Anyhow, I also want to unplug us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter,
269400	272920	twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, he'll be joining us
272920	273920	in a little bit.
273920	275440	We're teaming up tonight to do the coverage.
275440	278560	He is also on Twitter, twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.
278560	283040	And the reason why I plug that is that today he was pretty dominated at the Nintendo booth
283040	284040	all day.
284040	288440	Well, he wasn't dominated at the Nintendo booth, maybe, but his day was dominated by
288440	291960	the Nintendo booth because he was at the Wii U event today.
291960	294560	But tomorrow he will be taking your orders.
294560	298540	You will be dominating him on Twitter and he is going to be your man on the floor at
298540	300720	twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.
300720	305800	And if you're like, hey, what freaking Konami games are there that weren't at the press
305800	309960	conference or whatever, and he'll tweet you back and say, glee karaoke revolution with
309960	310960	Rocky Horror.
310960	311960	Yay.
311960	315440	Reggie's bitch today, your bitch tomorrow.
315440	316840	So twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.
316840	320840	I also want to say thank you to those of you guys that have retweeted, helped promote these
320840	321840	special shows.
321840	325080	I know it's a little weird because we're not in our usual home, but you know, we had to
325080	327920	kind of think fast and this all really came together last minute.
327920	329240	So I want to thank everybody involved.
329240	333720	I want to give a special shout out to video game outsiders who has a show usually live
333720	335180	tonight at all games.
335180	338840	They didn't end up doing one tonight because of personal reasons, but they send a tweet
338840	342340	that was like, eh, go listen to OLR and I thought that was very nice of them to do.
342340	345820	And so I wanted to give them a shout out and a thank you.
345820	348380	It's going to be a night of varying opinions.
348380	349380	It's going to be fun.
349380	352400	So remember kids play nice and be respectful.
352400	353400	Let's jump into it.
353400	357080	Microsoft, Microsoft press conference starts us off tonight.
357080	360060	The Microsoft press conference, of course, was delivered Monday afternoon.
360060	365680	I imagine most of you listening don't need, I'm sorry, well, East coast, Monday afternoon,
365680	366680	fine, Monday morning.
366680	370020	Most of you listening don't need a recap of everything that was talked about, but let
370020	376120	me remind you some of the highlights, halo, halo anniversary edition, halo four, neither
376120	379980	of which interesting enough had connect shown.
379980	381160	It was one of the only games.
381160	386000	In fact, I think of that whole press conference that didn't have connect shown.
386000	389380	Are there any excitement whatsoever about the new halo four or the halo anniversary
389380	390380	edition?
390380	391380	Nope.
391380	392380	Did you hear it?
392380	393780	I'm into it.
393780	394780	I like halo.
394780	396180	I'm stoked for more halo.
396180	398740	I'm, I'm looking forward to a new halo as well.
398740	403460	I mean, obviously the teaser was just that it was, it was literally a title announcement
403460	404540	and nothing else.
404540	409660	The only other little, little pickins to drop or to take from that is it's another trilogy.
409660	412820	And I thought that was interesting that they're committing now to six halo games.
412820	416060	I will say this, it did mess with my head.
416060	418460	Not seeing the bungee logo before the halo trailers.
418460	419460	Did it?
419460	420460	Yeah.
420460	421460	I was just like, Oh, it's halo.
421460	422460	Oh yeah.
422460	423860	There is no bungee making halo anymore.
423860	425580	Oh, that's kind of sad.
425580	426580	Yeah.
426580	429700	It did seem like that trailer had a very different look to it as well.
429700	431300	It just didn't have that bungee feel.
431300	432300	Yeah.
432300	433300	It didn't.
433300	434300	It didn't have that big like, oh, that's okay.
434300	435700	I think, you know?
435700	436700	Yeah.
436700	437700	That's true.
437700	440980	Bungee kind of ran, ran their course, I guess, but I don't even say they ran their course,
440980	445860	but it's, it's, you know, it's just like, okay, there were the Batman movies from the
445860	447420	eighties and nineties and stuff.
447420	451420	And then there's, you know, the new Batman series and you know, both.
451420	452420	Okay.
452420	456740	Well the beginning of one was good and you know, the other one is also good, but it's
456740	460860	refreshing, I guess, to have like a new style of gameplay.
460860	462020	Yeah.
462020	467020	But it's, it's hard to deny the fact that, you know, it's bungee's, bungee's franchise
467020	468020	was bungee's.
468020	472860	It's Microsoft's franchise now, but, and it's weird that it won't have their stamp on it
472860	477740	unless the new developers are just sick copycats, which is about the best I could hope for.
477740	480820	Let me jump over to anniversary collection for a minute.
480820	484500	Huge speculation on the internet before that it was going to be very connect heavy.
484500	488020	In fact, I believe there was a domain, halo connect.com or something.
488020	491260	Now granted, there could be more announcements between now and when the game actually comes
491260	495820	out, but unlike most of the other stuff that Microsoft was pushing at E3, wasn't seeing
495820	497980	connect in this halo game.
497980	499820	Do you think they changed their mind?
499820	501260	Do you think this is yet to come?
501260	505860	No, it's because that would have required them to do some extra work because basically
505860	507380	they're just porting the asset.
507380	512080	They're upgrading the assets slightly and they're porting it over to the reach engines.
512080	516460	So it would have required them to rebuild a portion of the engine to get it and oh,
516460	519220	and adjusting the physics so that it's like halo one.
519220	523900	But um, that's what it would have required extra work for them to do that.
523900	524900	Maybe halo four.
524900	528380	Yeah, you can bet your ass halo four will use connect.
528380	533100	Did you find that little footnote that came out after the press conference about that
533100	536460	the multiplayer is all just multiplayer maps for halo reach.
536460	541300	It is not actually a part of the halo anniversary collection or whatever anniversary.
541300	542300	It is.
542300	544300	No, I had read this thing online.
544300	545300	Here's how it works.
545300	546300	Okay.
546300	547300	Now that can't be right.
547300	548300	Please, please share me.
548300	549300	Okay.
549300	550300	It's very similar to ODST.
550300	556380	You have one disc that has the single player campaign on it and of course the co-op for
556380	557380	that.
557380	559620	Then you have also the multiplayer disc.
559620	567580	Now the whole multiplayer disc is the full halo reach multiplayer portion, I guess.
567580	573500	And the maps do exist on the reach servers, but in it, since it's also in the reach engine,
573500	577940	that's what's going on is these maps are for reach, but you can play against other people
577940	580540	that also have reach, I believe as well.
580540	581540	Interesting.
581540	584140	Well, I guess that's kind of cool if it kind of bridges that.
584140	586580	Yeah, because ODST is the same thing they did theirs.
586580	590740	It was halo three airplane on.
590740	592900	So it's not, it's not bad.
592900	596100	It's, it's, and considering the fact that it's also going to be a budget price game
596100	598620	too, it's going to be a $40 game when it comes out.
598620	602700	Just because they know they can't make a better multiplayer engine than bungee did.
602700	607420	Let's talk connect for a little bit because obviously connect dominated a lot of Microsoft's
607420	610700	press conference and it's taken a lot of flack on the internet because of that.
610700	614820	I noticed when I was watching Twitter, um, over the press conference, there's a lot of
614820	620800	people hating on Microsoft right now because their conference was very connect heavy and
620800	624900	it didn't seem to address the hardcore gamer, which is funny because that's the battle Nintendo's
624900	626140	been fighting for years.
626140	627140	Bullshit.
627140	628140	I'm sorry.
628140	632100	Well, I have the best stage and that's important.
632100	633580	Hey, it was important.
633580	637100	I mean, we're going to get into it later on, but they're, they're not the only ones that,
637100	638100	you know, okay.
638100	642220	Other than, you know, PlayStation, I guess, uh, they're not the only ones that really
642220	645340	focus on their, their motion gaming stuff.
645340	649180	Um, and yeah, what they showed, I think it's a little bit of everything.
649180	650180	Yeah.
650180	652460	It's some stuff for the hardcore players and he had some stuff that's like, well, this
652460	659420	shit's on, you know, could have been on the Wii or, you know, it's very kidsy, I guess.
659420	663300	Let me ask a question of our chat room at chat.orangelauncherator.com again, uh, for
663300	666540	those that are joining us for the first time because of the Ustream connection here, our
666540	670300	normal chat room is at chat.orangelauncherator.com, uh, answer this for me.
670300	671300	Be honest.
671300	673240	Is there a connect title you want to try?
673240	676340	And I want to talk about some of those connect titles that were announced at the show.
676340	679980	And I want to go to dark soccer for a minute because I know you must've perked up when
679980	682740	you heard about the Disneyland connect game.
682740	684580	Did you hear about the Disneyland connect game?
684580	685940	No, I didn't actually.
685940	686940	Yes.
686940	689780	There's this whole, I relied on somebody to fill me in.
689780	692060	Obviously Dan didn't fill her in on the Disneyland connect.
692060	693060	You didn't ask.
693060	694060	All right.
694060	699360	So there's this whole Disneyland connect game going on where they really harped on.
699360	703580	You're going to get to be in Disneyland and they actually showed, you know, like you're
703580	706620	going through down main street and so forth.
706620	711360	But then as you walk up to a ride, like Peter Pan's adventure, they had these little overacting
711360	712860	kids on stage demonstrating it.
712860	713860	It was just mini games.
713860	716780	And you know what it made me think of, I don't know if you guys remember an old eight bit
716780	719940	game by Capcom years and years ago called adventures in the magic kingdom.
719940	720940	Yes.
720940	721940	It was an old ass NES game.
721940	723520	It was the same thing.
723520	724820	Do you know what this game is?
724820	725820	What?
725820	727040	It's another connected ventures game.
727040	731460	It's seriously connect Disneyland adventures, connect adventures.
731460	732460	It's all it is.
732460	736880	That's why you're flying through stuff and collecting coins or whatever, except it's
736880	737880	in Disneyland.
737880	738880	That's all.
738880	739880	Disney hub looked cool.
739880	741660	No mini games looked like fun.
741660	743060	That's exactly where I'm at.
743060	744060	Exactly.
744060	745060	Exactly.
745060	749740	It's fine because it's, it looks fun, but you know, let me put it this way though.
749740	754120	They seriously need to tone down the acting for the people that they have on stage.
754120	758300	It was, it was to the point where it's distracting and I mean, I understand you want to make
758300	763180	it look fun and stuff like that, but Oh my God, just any idea how many Red Bulls those
763180	767580	kids drank, they worked their little hearts off and they're probably dead right now.
767580	770820	They burned out showing you how fun that game was.
770820	772340	I want to know what this horror is.
772340	773340	All right.
773340	777240	Dark soccer's pointing at Minecraft on the connect, which was a, a little, a little thing
777240	778240	that was dropped.
778240	784000	And there are some people that are supporting the Minecraft game guru, Minecraft, maybe
784000	785500	Kai's Judo Minecraft.
785500	786500	I want to try.
786500	788880	So there is some love for Minecraft.
788880	791540	Now we've talked on orange on trade before.
791540	795980	I don't think anybody here in the room got Minecraft quote unquote.
795980	796980	Like I tried it.
796980	799300	I get it, but I just don't want to play it.
799300	800300	Yeah.
800300	801300	Yeah.
801300	802300	I think that's where I'm at.
802300	803300	I'm like, I get it.
803300	804300	And I understand why people love it.
804300	805300	That being said, it's not for me.
805300	809140	I don't have that much free time in my day to play something like that.
809140	812620	But again, what I thought was interesting about the follow-up and what came out after
812620	817420	the press event is that the, obviously the Minecraft was pretty much independently developed.
817420	823420	I think by one guy or just one very small studio, uh, they are not doing this 360 version.
823420	827920	They have basically, I don't know, contracted out or sold the license for somebody else
827920	830100	to develop, which makes sense.
830100	831700	Minecraft's at an all time high right now.
831700	835900	There's iPhone things you're going to see and everything else is going to be everywhere.
835900	840820	You know, I don't have a problem necessarily with being on 360 and it looked fun and I
840820	842300	probably would like Minecraft.
842300	847180	Like I said, if I existed in a world that had 48 hour days, but I don't.
847180	851240	So I unfortunately don't have time to play something like that.
851240	854940	We have some more feedback in our chat room on the Disney game, Disneyland adventures
854940	856360	for the kinetic tiger claw.
856360	859780	When they showed that Disneyland game, I was reminded of that universal studios game on
859780	860780	the game cube.
860780	861780	I remember that game.
861780	862780	Hmm.
862780	863780	Actually, I don't.
863780	864980	So that doesn't bode well for this game.
864980	865980	It was bad.
865980	866980	What was it?
866980	867980	I don't even remember it.
867980	871900	It was a bunch of universal studios, mini games that was all hosted by woody woodpecker.
871900	873540	There was like a back to the future game.
873540	876300	So I was like, I got to see, this has got back to the future in it.
876300	879220	Was that the best talent they could get was woody woodpecker?
879220	883100	Universal's kind of cartoon mascot was woody woodpecker.
883100	887340	That would be like, okay, we've got a Disneyland game coming out, but unfortunately all the
887340	891420	Disneyland characters, like 98% of them were too expensive to license.
891420	893380	So we got Herbie, the love bug to be in the game.
893380	895380	We decided to do Knott's Berry Farm.
895380	896380	It's Disney.
896380	897380	That's it.
897380	899500	We couldn't get Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse.
899500	904580	Connect Knott's Berry Farm adventures.
904580	908420	At least they'd have good chicken.
908420	913460	Savalas in the charm says, uh, connect Disney is for families in Nebraska who are not able
913460	915820	to get to a Disney amusement park.
915820	918540	I see it as more like the thing to just shut the kids up.
918540	919540	No, no.
919540	924660	I'm sure that my store, Nebraska Furniture Mart will sell plenty of those, but, uh, no,
924660	929580	I think what it is is it's another connected, you know, adventurous type game and you know
929580	930580	what?
930580	935100	It will sell like crazy because it looks fun and it's better than some of the other mini
935100	937220	game crap that's out there for it.
937220	941500	And Disney people will buy it just because apparently it's going to promise that you
941500	944540	can wander around Disneyland on the connect.
944540	948140	Blackness in our chat room says, I really do hope somebody hacks the Disneyland connect
948140	950900	assets and makes a grand theft auto style port.
950900	951900	Come on now.
951900	953400	Let the kids have something.
953400	956860	Who hasn't made grand theft auto and uh, and GTA yet.
956860	957860	Come on, Matt.
957860	961140	Did you do that or who hasn't made Disney a grand theft auto yet?
961140	963100	Well, I guess the kids do have something.
963100	967580	Did you see the Sesame street game that they spent some time demoing and, and collectively
967580	971960	Twitter was rolling their eyes, but I was like, dude, I wish they had the Sesame street
971960	973740	game when I was six.
973740	974740	I hate fucking Elmo.
974740	975740	Maybe with less Elmo.
975740	980100	If it had like cookie monster and big bird in it, I'd be like, this game is going to
980100	981100	be tight.
981100	983740	If Mr. Hooper was still alive, I'm going to play it.
983740	989380	If Linda, the deaf lady was teaching me how to sign, dude, Linda, the deaf lady was hot.
989380	992620	There you go.
992620	996180	Uh, black Wolf is in our chat room right now talking to the chatters.
996180	1000460	They're saying I had Sesame street games on my Intellivision word fun and electric company
1000460	1001460	math fun.
1001460	1004660	Dude, the electric company game was amazing.
1004660	1008940	I want to know more about this whole live streaming TV thing they were talking about.
1008940	1010580	Was I the only one that didn't really get it?
1010580	1011640	Like it, I don't get it.
1011640	1014540	It flowed really weird in their presser for me.
1014540	1015620	They were watching castle.
1015620	1016620	Yeah.
1016620	1017620	They're watching castle.
1017620	1021460	Apparently I caught a little ad in the sidebar and I don't know if it was just a marketing
1021460	1024340	placeholder or whatever, but it said the connect show.
1024340	1027740	And that made me think, is Microsoft producing their own content for this too?
1027740	1028940	Or was that just a placeholder?
1028940	1032540	I think it's a placeholder, but here's the thing is it's basically going to be content
1032540	1037300	that you say, for example, like, you know, I have Comcast, so it's going to be Comcast
1037300	1038300	programming.
1038300	1039300	Great.
1039300	1043580	I can just turn the TV on and watch TV.
1043580	1045980	You know, I don't need to watch TV through my 360.
1045980	1049620	My 360 act as a TiVo because if so, I could actually kind of use that.
1049620	1054660	Well, what it's doing is you guys know what like the review is like those set top boxes
1054660	1056140	that you just plug into your TV.
1056140	1061420	And instead of actually having their own content, what they do is they look around the net for
1061420	1065260	content kind of like windows media center will do, and then let you play it.
1065260	1067460	It's just going to be a service like that for the Xbox.
1067460	1071740	And that kind of ties into the other announcements about the partnerships with YouTube finally
1071740	1072740	coming to Xbox.
1072740	1074540	I think a lot of us are going, okay, it's about time.
1074540	1075540	We got a decent YouTube player.
1075540	1076540	That'd be pretty cool.
1076540	1077540	That is going to be pretty cool.
1077540	1081940	And then this whole Xbox Bing thing where I guess you can go Xbox, Harry Potter, and
1081940	1084860	it'll show you all the games, all the CDs.
1084860	1087300	So I mean, will it, will it like search the internet too?
1087300	1088300	I mean, do we have a legit?
1088300	1091700	No, it won't search the internet because it doesn't have a fucking web browser in it.
1091700	1099040	Will connect finally respond to me going Xbox, Bing, gay porn.
1099040	1102240	It'll probably look up my little pony.
1102240	1103420	It'll come back with some indie gay.
1103420	1112580	I'll come back with my little Care Bears, the Smurfs, Lady Gaga on HBO.
1112580	1116980	I hate the new interface.
1116980	1117980	It was weird.
1117980	1121380	It took me a minute to figure out that they were actually demoing a new interface.
1121380	1123560	Like I, I mean, I'm not stupid.
1123560	1128440	I saw that it was a new interface, but I thought it was kind of like a spinoff for the TV thing.
1128440	1131580	Like like the connect thing is, is a little separate thing.
1131580	1138720	I didn't think I was looking at a whole new dashboard and I was kind of like, okay.
1138720	1140540	It looked like the crossbar a little bit.
1140540	1146020	No, it's, it's modeled after windows seven phone stuff and then also windows eight is
1146020	1148220	supposed to be very similar to that.
1148220	1152260	Good for them to do that kind of, first off, you know, windows eight, you know, that shit
1152260	1153260	is optional.
1153260	1154340	It's like the fucking media center.
1154340	1157340	You don't have to use media center if you don't want to.
1157340	1161180	However, on the Xbox 360, it's not fucking optional.
1161180	1166300	I I'm sorry, hitting the guide button again to get my fucking blades back is not fucking
1166300	1167300	optional.
1167300	1168300	That is, I want the blades.
1168300	1173420	I mean, it's, you know what, here's the, here's a thought and I know this is crazy and out
1173420	1178780	there, but how about we have themes we can download where we can say, Hey, you know what?
1178780	1179780	I like the blades.
1179780	1180780	I'm going to keep it on the blades.
1180780	1185220	Hey, I know I want to keep it on this, you know, the new Xbox experience.
1185220	1187640	All this is now is, Hey, look at this.
1187640	1188640	What game am I playing?
1188640	1191860	Is that a tiny little box in the corner and all these ads are everywhere else.
1191860	1196040	Uh, technus in our chat room at chat.org.com says, I think it's great.
1196040	1197760	They added complete voice search.
1197760	1201580	It's pretty hard and quite pathetic that in the current dashboard it's hard to find shit.
1201580	1202580	I agree.
1202580	1203580	That's kind of my problem.
1203580	1208020	You know, connect fun labs was on the thing like right after the press conference.
1208020	1209700	You had to dig to find it.
1209700	1210700	No you didn't.
1210700	1211700	You should.
1211700	1212700	I, it was not on the main bar.
1212700	1213700	You had to go to the E3 coverage.
1213700	1214700	You didn't look hard enough.
1214700	1215700	Then you go to connect.
1215700	1216700	No, no, no.
1216700	1217700	It was on mine.
1217700	1218700	It did not come right up.
1218700	1219700	All right.
1219700	1220700	It was on the community page.
1220700	1221700	The community bar that was right there.
1221700	1225540	It was like one of the first, you know, few, I should have thought to look in community.
1225540	1226540	God damn it.
1226540	1227540	It was right there.
1227540	1228540	Yeah.
1228540	1232260	Instead of having to dig, well, when it's like the thing you just announced today, shouldn't
1232260	1233900	it be like on the main bar?
1233900	1235260	I mean, I don't know.
1235260	1239340	It is on one of the main bars, isn't community basically where it starts?
1239340	1242660	I thought it was, yeah, pretty much whatever.
1242660	1243660	All right.
1243660	1245820	Uh, moving on to some other announcements.
1245820	1248900	Uh, some of the nonconnect things at the top were actually pretty cool.
1248900	1253220	Uh, there was the modern warfare three demo that they demoed and you know, I'm not into
1253220	1256700	those games, but I was kind of looking at the footage going, oh, that's really pretty.
1256700	1258060	That's, that's pretty cool.
1258060	1261420	If I could actually do that when I play the game, as opposed to just running into walls
1261420	1263080	constantly and shooting my friends.
1263080	1268860	You mean there's a modern army game where I can shoot things and shit explodes?
1268860	1271260	That's revolutionary and brand new.
1271260	1274380	I have to admit, I thought it was pretty cool when they were doing that whole little getaway
1274380	1275380	in the raft.
1275380	1277500	I was like, it's like super army cart.
1277500	1279820	They had, they had a raft at the end of the last game.
1279820	1281860	Oh, shows you how much I play those games.
1281860	1282860	Modern warfare.
1282860	1284940	And the truth is I like modern warfare.
1284940	1287140	All right.
1287140	1288800	And then, and I love this.
1288800	1290820	The Tomb Raider demo was hot.
1290820	1295780	I thought that that was like my favorite thing was neat, but once again, you know, I've already,
1295780	1300620	I've kind of, you know, set that franchise aside for, well actually since the first Tomb
1300620	1302620	Raider, I just never got into Tomb Raider.
1302620	1304340	Well, see the thing about this, but it looks cool.
1304340	1305340	Yeah.
1305340	1309900	The thing about this new Tomb Raider is that it didn't look at all like the old ones.
1309900	1311620	Cause it didn't look like a reboot at all.
1311620	1313140	I know it looks like uncharted
1313140	1321980	Maybe that's why they have adventure sense, which is like saying, Hey, you can't figure
1321980	1323300	out the puzzle.
1323300	1324620	We'll do it for you.
1324620	1327420	I'm going to need Tomb Raider for idiots.
1327420	1331420	Well, I, I, what I loved about it though is that there was scenes very reminiscent of
1331420	1335400	that movie, the descent, which is like one of the few movies ever to legit scare the
1335400	1336400	shit out of me.
1336400	1339580	So I can kind of see where the survival horror thing is coming from for Tomb Raider.
1339580	1341700	Cause some of that stuff did look kind of scary.
1341700	1343140	I Tomb Raider needs something.
1343140	1352140	And if this, if this rejuvenates the franchise, great, but just the same, it's like it's uncharted.
1352140	1356300	How many times have they tried to reboot, you know, Tomb Raider so many times and it's
1356300	1357300	failed every time.
1357300	1359220	So hopefully this time is a little different.
1359220	1360640	Congratulations, X-Box.
1360640	1361740	You get uncharted.
1361740	1362740	It's Tomb Raider.
1362740	1365600	Well, I thought, well, but Tomb Raider is not exclusive to the 360 either.
1365600	1368780	So I thought it was weird that they demoed it at the PS three people could just play
1368780	1369780	uncharted.
1369780	1371500	Yeah, that's why they didn't demo it.
1371500	1374900	They don't want to show uncharted and then, you know, Tomb Raider, Hey, this looks kind
1374900	1375900	of similar.
1375900	1377260	Like, Oh, wait a minute.
1377260	1378260	Uncharted is awesome.
1378260	1380060	And Tomb Raider is trying again.
1380060	1383580	Tiger claw in our chat room says the Tomb Raider demo got kind of creepy with all the
1383580	1389220	moaning and panting from Laura Croft game guru says Tomb Raider looks too much like
1389220	1390820	a survival horror game.
1390820	1392300	Uh, let's see.
1392300	1395620	Randy you says, dude, stabbing Laura and closing her eyes.
1395620	1396620	What the fuck?
1396620	1404300	Jenai in our chat room says uncharted is so bro, bro, bro, uncharted is pretty cool.
1404300	1407220	Did watch that little bit of the demo of the uncharted demo.
1407220	1408220	Yeah.
1408220	1409220	Yeah.
1409220	1410220	Dan was watching it.
1410220	1411760	It was let's drown for awhile.
1411760	1413420	Let's press a repeatedly.
1413420	1414620	Let's not drown for awhile.
1414620	1415620	That's uncharted.
1415620	1417460	So I was like, yeah, it won't play.
1417460	1418460	Let's shoot people.
1418460	1419700	And then quick time events.
1419700	1420700	Awesome.
1420700	1424900	Uh, and then of course connect fun labs was shown and I wanted to see the look on Loki's
1424900	1426220	face when that was being demoed.
1426220	1427220	That was awesome.
1427220	1428220	Well, here's the thing.
1428220	1429220	Okay.
1429220	1430220	All this stuff got spoiled.
1430220	1431220	Like right before the press conference.
1431220	1434700	Oh look, our E3 page got leaked out.
1434700	1440700	So it, no, all the big, you know, announcements, they were already out there and connect fun
1440700	1441700	labs.
1441700	1447540	That shit leaked a while ago, but, and here's what you connect fun labs is it's, Hey, look,
1447540	1451380	here's all the tech stuff that we said we could do before and couldn't do.
1451380	1455840	Now you can, you know, remember the whole, Hey, I can scan my skateboard in there and
1455840	1457420	you know, play the first thing that they showed.
1457420	1461860	Did you notice even the lady said, finally, she's like, and now you can scan in your skateboard
1461860	1462860	finally.
1462860	1464980	So, you know, she'd been catching shit about that for a year.
1464980	1468660	Like the first thing they show is someone scanning a skateboard in and then jumping
1468660	1471780	on a virtual skateboard and playing, and now they're like, Oh, you can do it.
1471780	1472780	Well.
1472780	1476620	And the thing about connect to me too, and the whole fun labs that it is not changing
1476620	1477700	your avatar.
1477700	1482180	Like it's not like how the 3ds will make a me out of taking a picture of you.
1482180	1486060	It is just like a temporary thing to do fashion magazine poses.
1486060	1490300	Like what the fuck is the whole thing where, Oh, you don't have to fumble through menus
1490300	1494060	anymore to, you know, pick your, your avatar then you're full of shit.
1494060	1497860	I'm trying to be, I'm not hooking up our connect after all.
1497860	1499620	You can not make the avatar out of it.
1499620	1503620	You know what I did, what I wanted to test, I wore my Pikachu shirt to see if it would
1503620	1507540	take a picture of the Pikachu shirt and like actually show Pikachu, if it would just be
1507540	1510260	a yellow shirt and it came through as a Pikachu shirt.
1510260	1514140	I mean, it was a horrible scan of it, but it was definitely Pikachu.
1514140	1517660	And I was thinking, well, obviously this won't be the main avatar because they can't show
1517660	1519980	all that copyrighted stuff that people scan in.
1519980	1521820	Somebody will wear a Dick on their shirt.
1521820	1524500	I haven't tried it yet, but that's gotta be wrong.
1524500	1525500	I am.
1525500	1526860	I am not see if you can figure it out.
1526860	1527860	Chat.
1527860	1528860	Is anyone play connect fun labs?
1528860	1529860	Tell me for all.
1529860	1530860	I do not believe you.
1530860	1531860	Let's hook up our connect.
1531860	1532860	Save your avatar.
1532860	1533860	Sure connect.
1533860	1535860	Someone was supposed to lend me dance masters.
1535860	1536860	Alright.
1536860	1540340	Dance central two.
1540340	1541340	Yeah.
1541340	1542340	Dance central.
1542340	1543340	What'd you think of dance central two?
1543340	1544340	It looks like dance central one.
1544340	1549900	I, I, I have to admit I'm a big fan of dance central, but I didn't see besides obviously
1549900	1551340	der the two player thing.
1551340	1552780	I didn't see what was new about it.
1552780	1553780	Here's what's new about it.
1553780	1557740	And I know this because I saw the actual feature list so that what they did is they improve
1557740	1564140	the break it down mode where you can actually repeat individual, um, like moves or practice
1564140	1565140	individual moves.
1565140	1566140	It needed to be.
1566140	1572420	You can also, um, you know, repeat whole sections of, um, you know, that stuff.
1572420	1578220	Uh, there's also, I think what else there was in there, you know, the two player at
1578220	1582660	the same time, they also have the ability where you can get rid of the freestyle stuff.
1582660	1586940	Say you don't want to do that where you flail about randomly during the song.
1586940	1590540	You can take that out or you can change the way it looks.
1590540	1592740	Um, some of that stuff.
1592740	1595820	And then of course, you know, the, the new music that they're going to have in there.
1595820	1596820	Yeah.
1596820	1598780	I don't think they did a whole lot with dance central too.
1598780	1602460	And honestly, they probably could have just left it alone, but well, it's also one of
1602460	1604700	those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, why fix it?
1604700	1607260	How many dance games are on the Wii or not?
1607260	1608260	Sorry.
1608260	1611220	The, uh, the connect connects what there's that dance.
1611220	1612740	There's dance masters.
1612740	1614860	Just dance was announced, will be coming.
1614860	1616380	Uh, and there's that dance paradise.
1616380	1617380	Is that what it is?
1617380	1623380	There is there's dance masters, dance central to just dance three right now available right
1623380	1624380	now.
1624380	1627940	Dance paradise, uh, dance masters and dance central.
1627940	1628940	So it's three.
1628940	1633340	I like how they're like, it's the number one selling game on the connect and Michael Jackson,
1633340	1634340	the experience.
1634340	1635340	Okay.
1635340	1636340	Maybe there's four.
1636340	1639340	Well, because it is the number one selling one by a mile and with kind of good reason
1639340	1641100	because it's the only good one.
1641100	1642100	Just the answer.
1642100	1643100	But here's the thing though.
1643100	1644340	Just dance though.
1644340	1648540	I mean, it's good on like the Wii and stuff because of the limitations of that.
1648540	1653460	But you know, when you kind of bring that in with, you know, dance mat, well not necessarily
1653460	1656220	dance, but dance central, I don't know if it's going to be able to hold its own.
1656220	1658900	I mean, people will buy it because they're like, Oh, Hey, just dance.
1658900	1660100	It's popular.
1660100	1664980	But um, you know, I think it dance central does a better job though.
1664980	1667980	I think just dance sells well cause it's got the right name.
1667980	1669820	Everyone's like dance central.
1669820	1671160	What's that all about?
1671160	1672160	Just dance.
1672160	1673160	Hey, I can just dance.
1673160	1675740	Have really solid, uh, song lists too.
1675740	1676940	And I think that's a big part of it.
1676940	1681620	And more dance masters stumbled is that sure the Konami thing reaches a very niche audience,
1681620	1685100	which you know, happens to be a lot of the people that's listened to this show historically,
1685100	1687900	but unfortunately it doesn't really reach anybody beyond that.
1687900	1692420	You know, people pick up the box for dance masters and go, what's this dance paradise?
1692420	1694900	Just it was late to the game and it kind of looks clunky.
1694900	1695900	I don't know.
1695900	1699660	I said only ones I'd seen were dance masters and dance central and the only one I've tried
1699660	1700660	is dance central.
1700660	1707420	I would love to see a dance game with like half Konami ish songs, half dance central
1707420	1710820	ish songs in the dance masters interface, because I think there's some cool things that
1710820	1711980	dance masters brings to the table.
1711980	1712980	I want more Para Para.
1712980	1718580	Well then you would be talking about part of my, my pitch for a new DDR game, of course,
1718580	1719580	you see.
1719580	1721500	All right, let me get to some quick, quick thoughts.
1721500	1722620	We want to get on to Sony.
1722620	1730060	I want to get to Bobby and all that, uh, quick thoughts fable the journey.
1730060	1733060	Here's my problem with necessarily fable the journey.
1733060	1734060	Looks good.
1734060	1736300	I mean, it looks nice cause it's an unreal three now.
1736300	1738380	Um, here's my problem with the connect game.
1738380	1741260	So everything's on fucking rails.
1741260	1743340	Everything is on fucking rails.
1743340	1747060	Doesn't the halo rail shooter make more sense than a fable rail shooter?
1747060	1749100	Everything is on fucking rails.
1749100	1754980	The ghost recon game on rails, the fable game on rails, star wars on rails.
1754980	1757580	It's that's all they can do is on rail shooters.
1757580	1764380	They can't actually do anything where you have actual control that that's where one
1764380	1769300	thing that plays Asian has over, you know, the connect is, Hey, you know what?
1769300	1770860	We have a navigation controller.
1770860	1772740	We can navigate around the map.
1772740	1774620	Whereas you guys are stuck on a rail.
1774620	1778540	You need the Xbox nunchuck.
1778540	1782940	I you know, I'm coming off of fable three and what I was just talked about on last week.
1782940	1785740	So LR and I was not feeling that great about fable three.
1785740	1791100	And so when I saw this preview, I, I was just kind of, eh, if it's $20 maybe, yeah, it looked
1791100	1792100	all right.
1792100	1795300	It would be pretty cool, like Xbox live arcade game and I liked how the perspective is a
1795300	1796300	little different.
1796300	1799180	It actually knew it'd be kind of, it kind of reminded me of, cause it is an on rails
1799180	1802220	shooter is it would be a pretty cool arcade game.
1802220	1809180	Yeah, actually an actual arcade, an actual arcade game because it's an on rail shooter.
1809180	1813860	Other quick thoughts since she's brought up on rail shooter, what I think will be as much
1813860	1816860	as we're all probably looking at it going, eh, I think it's gonna be huge this holiday
1816860	1819140	connects star wars.
1819140	1823580	I just hope they fix the lag of shit because the lag looked terrible from what they were
1823580	1825500	showing the guy playing.
1825500	1828180	Even the guy doubling it looked like ass playing it.
1828180	1829180	It was horrible.
1829180	1833060	Did you see when he tried to lift that ship up and move it and he dropped it?
1833060	1834060	That was hilarious.
1834060	1837100	Oh man, I was, I felt bad for him.
1837100	1838960	But of course the games are still early on.
1838960	1839960	So there you go.
1839960	1840960	Uh, let's see.
1840960	1841960	Did I miss anything else?
1841960	1843260	Do you guys think of big, big stuff?
1843260	1845660	I mean, there was Tom Clancy game was shown as well.
1845660	1848560	Uh, Gears of War three, which I actually.
1848560	1856500	The one that looks kind of cool is a rise that the new cry tech, um, game, uh, the yeah,
1856500	1857500	the Roman one.
1857500	1860940	I saw the dude kicking in that and I was like, he's going to like kick his connect right
1860940	1861940	off the TV.
1861940	1863400	I can't play that in my house.
1863400	1865220	I get to see the achievement now.
1865220	1868660	This is Sparta.
1868660	1873980	Every time I do that, you know, but that, that's why a game like that'll sell because
1873980	1876900	there's going to be a lot of like, that's the thing though.
1876900	1882220	It's an actual, but as long as the, you know, combat's good and not clunky, like, you know,
1882220	1884380	fighters uncaged or something like that.
1884380	1885380	I don't know.
1885380	1889500	It, there was a lot of cool stuff that they show like forza four looks pretty awesome.
1889500	1893700	Um, and the head tracking stuff and that once again, also kind of laggy, but I don't really
1893700	1897340	know how you would be able to do that anyways, cause you're kind of, you can't really turn
1897340	1903740	your head, you know, it just doesn't really work with a stationary, you know, monitor.
1903740	1907020	It sure didn't work in a Gran Turismo five.
1907020	1912660	Uh, and oh yeah, forza, which is Dan, I know you're a racing game fan forza.
1912660	1913660	Forza looked great.
1913660	1914660	Now did you see that?
1914660	1915660	Great looking racing game.
1915660	1917660	Did you see their new steering wheel that they have?
1917660	1922300	That looks like, but $60 wireless steering wheel.
1922300	1923300	What's the point?
1923300	1926020	Oh, you can wave it around in mid air.
1926020	1927020	Sweet.
1927020	1930500	Gears of war three ice tea reuniting.
1930500	1931980	Why is he always look angry?
1931980	1939060	He's like, you know, it's like every, I don't understand why he was just like scowling.
1939060	1944340	He looked angry cause he was playing gears of war, which is a testosterone game for men.
1944340	1945340	War looks angry.
1945340	1950460	Well, you don't have to like be all, you know, fronting like you're just, you know, I'm going
1950460	1953420	to murder somebody after I'm done playing this game.
1953420	1957620	Although I got to say though, the gears of war three limited edition Xbox looks pretty
1957620	1958620	nice.
1958620	1959620	The black and red one.
1959620	1960620	Yeah.
1960620	1961620	That's good.
1961620	1966380	I want to quickly just mentioned the EA press conference that happened mass effect three
1966380	1969620	interesting voice command thing going on there.
1969620	1970620	Useless.
1970620	1972060	How quick, you know, I would never use that.
1972060	1975500	I would never, I mean, is it a great demo thing?
1975500	1977580	Like to show off your console to your friends?
1977580	1980340	Like look at this space minority report technology.
1980340	1984060	It's fun for like five minutes commanding your troops or whatever, you know, to do different
1984060	1985060	things.
1985060	1986060	Maybe.
1986060	1987060	I don't know if that was like that part.
1987060	1990500	Yeah, I could see that like doing the actual dialogue trees and stuff.
1990500	1993300	I have a directional pad right in my thumb.
1993300	1996140	Why do I need to even bother with this bullshit?
1996140	1997300	All right.
1997300	2001420	And then of course, a star Wars, the old Republic had its kind of first, uh, what is the opening
2001420	2003060	trailer shown for the game?
2003060	2005300	I don't know that people, that trailer was sick.
2005300	2006300	Yeah.
2006300	2009020	It looked, I don't know why the star Wars movies can't be like that.
2009020	2010500	That trailer was sick.
2010500	2011660	Uh, quickly.
2011660	2014420	The Ubisoft press conference with Mr. Caffeine.
2014420	2015500	What was up with that guy?
2015500	2016940	I didn't watch the whole thing.
2016940	2022020	I saw caffeine, by the way, when you actually go to a show and see Mr. Caffeine in person,
2022020	2023020	he's amazing.
2023020	2026380	Uh, far cry three was the only game I'd really seen.
2026380	2031660	And I was like, there was part of the dialogue to me, felt like it was trying to be too edgy.
2031660	2032660	I don't know.
2032660	2036020	All I know is when it showed the dude doing the stealth kills, where he like walked up
2036020	2039580	behind the guy, pulled the knife out of the guy's pocket and stabbed him with it.
2039580	2042340	A little part of me, my heart grew three sizes.
2042340	2043340	The game parts.
2043340	2048380	I mean, I'm not going to play it, but man, I watching that dude kill people like that
2048380	2052660	was he, he like grabbed the guy's knife, stabbed him with it, whooped it out of him, and then
2052660	2054220	threw it at another guy and killed him.
2054220	2059480	I mean, it had to be prescripted because nobody could probably make that look that good, but
2059480	2061780	it looked like it would be really cool if I knew how to play it.
2061780	2063900	I like the fact that you don't have malaria.
2063900	2067220	All right, I'm going to go to the phones.
2067220	2069460	We're going to give Bobby Black Wolf a call.
2069460	2074460	He is our man, our correspondent that is at E3 this year.
2074460	2077580	The other thing too, Bobby's actually like syndicating what we're doing tonight on his
2077580	2081260	own feed, which I totally forgot to mention at the top of the show because there's just
2081260	2082860	so much going on tonight.
2082860	2087060	So of course, a big thanks to him for agreeing to do this with us tonight, and I think Bobby
2087060	2088060	is now on the line.
2088060	2089460	You there, Bobby?
2089460	2090460	I am here.
2090460	2091460	What's up, guys?
2091460	2092460	Not much.
2092460	2093460	How's the weather?
2093460	2094460	Well, a lot actually, but that's all right.
2094460	2097900	How's the weather in LA?
2097900	2100960	Not as warm as it is in Atlanta right now.
2100960	2102300	What an interesting change of pace.
2102300	2103300	It's been raining up here.
2103300	2104300	All right.
2104300	2105300	Forget the weather.
2105300	2109240	E3, how did day one treat you?
2109240	2113660	My feet hurt, but it was a lot of standing around.
2113660	2115500	It was a lot of standing around.
2115500	2119700	Yeah, because you waited all day today to play Wii U, didn't you?
2119700	2120700	Yes.
2120700	2126100	I was about two hours before I got in there, but then I had about an hour and a half to
2126100	2128140	kind of go through their eight demos.
2128140	2131060	Two hours actually isn't that bad, all things considered.
2131060	2135020	Did they have entertainment in the Wii line this year, or Wii U, excuse me, line to keep
2135020	2136020	you going?
2136020	2142020	No, and actually, when I walked up to it, it was about two o'clock, and the show floor
2142020	2148140	closes at six, and I walked up at two, and there was a lady at the end.
2148140	2152700	There was a sign that said, line closed, and I said, is it already full?
2152700	2156700	And she's like, well, yeah, we've cut off the line.
2156700	2160860	You're more than welcome to stay in here, but realize you may not get up to the front,
2160860	2163300	and you may waste the rest of your day.
2163300	2164300	And I said, okay.
2164300	2165300	Oh, wow.
2165300	2168140	And I got up there, and it wound up two hours later, you know, four o'clock, I'm starting
2168140	2170740	to play with the Wii Wii Wii U.
2170740	2171740	That's not that bad.
2171740	2173540	So I guess they were just trying to scare people away.
2173540	2176780	That's not that bad, all things considered, because the lines in the past, like the 3DS
2176780	2179700	line was atrocious last year, and then, of course, the original Wii line.
2179700	2183780	We all saw those videos on the internet of just the line keeps going and going and going.
2183780	2184780	That line was awesome.
2184780	2185780	All right.
2185780	2189060	Anyhow, we'll get to Nintendo in a minute, but let's start by talking about Sony, because
2189060	2195140	Sony happened yesterday, and you were there at the press conference, right, Bobby?
2195140	2196140	Correct.
2196140	2197700	So how was it?
2197700	2200780	You got like right in the front, practically, didn't you?
2200780	2204420	Yeah, it was kind of funny, because I got there a little late.
2204420	2209660	Like I took the shuttle from my hotel, and it started at five, and so I got on the bus,
2209660	2215380	on the bus, at about four or four-o-five, and in LA traffic, it was like 4.55 when we
2215380	2221580	finally pulled up to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is on USC campus.
2221580	2226620	So we finally pull up, and I'm like watching everybody, and we can't get off the bus.
2226620	2231140	It takes us like 15 minutes just to get around the corner into the parking lot.
2231140	2233380	And we're all like kind of walking in and stuff.
2233380	2237040	I missed all the food in the beginning and all that stuff, because I was hungry, because
2237040	2240100	I had eaten since Atlanta that morning.
2240100	2244820	And I made it all the way, you guys feel there?
2244820	2245820	Yeah, we're here.
2245820	2246820	Okay.
2246820	2249820	It was just some cut out from my phone.
2249820	2255820	Anyway, so I was walking, running in, and before I went through the door, there was
2255820	2260020	a guy saying, hey, there's more seats if you go down this ramp to the VIP area.
2260020	2263620	So I'm like, okay, I'll go down that ramp.
2263620	2267220	And so we went down that ramp, and it went underneath, and we were on the floor area,
2267220	2268780	and people were just directing us.
2268780	2275540	And they pointed to these seats on folding chairs on the floor right in front of the
2275540	2276540	stage.
2276540	2277540	Nice.
2277540	2280520	And there were like a lot of Sony employees sitting there, and so I was sitting there
2280520	2281520	with them.
2281520	2285580	And then all the Sony employees got kicked out, and more people came in.
2285580	2289700	And I realized everybody else that was sitting around me, like Michael Pachter and them,
2289700	2292980	all had these red VIP lanyards.
2292980	2293980	And I didn't have one of those.
2293980	2299860	So I was kind of like covering up my shirt or something, so it looked like I had a lanyard,
2299860	2300860	and they never noticed.
2300860	2304020	You were just in the right place at the right time.
2304020	2308060	Well, they got to make that section, you were just in the right place at the right time,
2308060	2309060	it sounds like.
2309060	2311420	Yeah, I hate being late.
2311420	2312420	Yeah.
2312420	2314940	And they've got to make that section look full, because that's the part of the auditorium
2314940	2317880	you can see on TV constantly, is kind of that first little area.
2317880	2320260	So it's got to be full and animated.
2320260	2322940	So I'm not surprised they were trying to fill it up.
2322940	2328020	But every time the camera was on me, I was tweaking.
2328020	2329620	Nice.
2329620	2331980	Let's talk a little bit about what happened at the Sony press conference.
2331980	2336820	Obviously, we're going to get to taboo when we come back with the Orange Launch Radio
2336820	2339040	next Sunday, the regular episodes.
2339040	2343660	But I lost a point in taboo, because Sony just opened right off the bat with somewhat
2343660	2348540	of an apology, and one that it seems like most people accepted.
2348540	2349540	Loki?
2349540	2351460	Loki's shaking his head a little bit.
2351460	2352460	It was retarded.
2352460	2353460	Really?
2353460	2358260	It's like, yeah, we learned a valuable lesson with this PlayStation outage set.
2358260	2360800	We realized how much you like playing online.
2360800	2362340	That's all they fucking learned.
2362340	2363340	That's all they learned.
2363340	2368140	It was not like, oh, hey, we're sorry that your credit card information was compromised.
2368140	2371520	It was, hey, you guys like playing online.
2371520	2373860	We're going to focus more on online play.
2373860	2376060	Let me ask the chat room how they feel about it.
2376060	2380240	Chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, were you satisfied with Sony's apology?
2380240	2381240	What do you think?
2381240	2384780	How did that go over in the crowd there and with you?
2384780	2390540	Well, first off, it was kind of interesting because you notice he never said they got
2390540	2391540	hacked.
2391540	2392540	They called it an outage.
2392540	2395620	They didn't say why it was an outage.
2395620	2399660	But a lot of people round up, and you gotta realize since I'm in the VIP section, I'm
2399660	2402540	around people who've been in the industry 20 years and all that stuff, and they kind
2402540	2406420	of were more understanding than the people that were probably up in the normal seats
2406420	2407900	and people at home.
2407900	2418300	So they were like, okay, he did mention it, and Jack, he does really good on stage.
2418300	2423620	Every year, because he always goes up there and something is bad press for Sony whenever
2423620	2426460	he walks up at E3.
2426460	2430940	He and his script writers handle it really well.
2430940	2434860	That was scripted because I can see the teleprompters from where I was.
2434860	2438420	And I knew how much of the entire press conference was actually scripted.
2438420	2439420	Oh, yeah.
2439420	2440420	They all were.
2440420	2444300	And he did a good job, and it stopped people from echoing them because that was one of
2444300	2449180	the things somebody asked me on Twitter is how many people were gonna interrupt the conference
2449180	2454820	yelling about the PSN hack, and nobody did because they addressed it right in the beginning
2454820	2456700	and said, hey, here's the elephant in the room.
2456700	2457700	Here it is.
2457700	2459700	We're sorry.
2459700	2463020	Going to some comments from our chat room at chat.worried.com, Rama in the chat room
2463020	2467660	says, that was not an apology, that was more of a thank you for the fans for sticking out.
2467660	2468660	That's a good way of putting it.
2468660	2469660	Yeah.
2469660	2470700	Technist says, yeah, it was okay.
2470700	2472980	It was mainly a canned response.
2472980	2476900	Dartitsuya says, better him than Kazurai.
2476900	2478860	Techie Q says, where was Kevin Butler?
2478860	2479860	Uh-huh.
2479860	2480860	Good question.
2480860	2482500	Did you spot Kevin Butler there?
2482500	2485660	No, I did not spot Kevin Butler.
2485660	2492000	He was there last year, but I think they're like, okay, we did that joke, and now we can
2492000	2493000	move on.
2493000	2498140	Kaijuto in the chat room, one of the comments here I want to get, Sony didn't need to apologize.
2498140	2500740	Free games and getting it back up was enough.
2500740	2501740	Not their fault.
2501740	2503060	Some dicks hacked them.
2503060	2508560	I just had to say, though, that it really did sound quite a bit more sincere than the
2508560	2510740	other canned stuff we had before.
2510740	2514880	Yeah, it was one of those things where it was like, it could have been a lot worse.
2514880	2519260	But seeing as like most of the Twittersphere at the end of the day seems to be dogging
2519260	2522780	on Microsoft and Nintendo, again, I'm making broad generalizations.
2522780	2526580	But most of the Twitter that I'm looking at is dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, but
2526580	2532380	is kind of praising Sony, I would say, distraction successful.
2532380	2533380	I think that Sony-
2533380	2535260	Yes, that was a distraction event.
2535260	2536260	Right.
2536260	2539660	Well, but it's exactly what their PR needed.
2539660	2546660	Speaking of audience reaction, Bobby, since you were there, how was it when you, in the
2546660	2552500	theater, when it was announced that the PlayStation Vita is going to be exclusive 3G on AT&T?
2552500	2557180	Because I could tell you, we heard it pretty clear, how bad was it where you were?
2557180	2559740	Was it really a lot of groans?
2559740	2565700	It wasn't loud, but I mean, I heard like all the laughter of, yeah, we figured it and all
2565700	2566700	the groans.
2566700	2570300	And we could even see Kaz was kind of like not expecting that.
2570300	2575060	I think if he had said the word Verizon instead, it would have been a much different reaction.
2575060	2580580	But no, it was very, that was the one negative part of their press conference was that.
2580580	2581580	Yeah.
2581580	2584860	Nobody didn't present it very well, because honestly enough, I was in the chat.
2584860	2588820	I was watching online and so I was watching the people chatting in the sidebar and those
2588820	2592880	people are absolute blithering idiots, but they were just like, does that mean I can
2592880	2594460	only get it through AT&T?
2594460	2598340	And it's like, oh my God, please just die.
2598340	2602860	Well, and it just struck me as interesting because I feel like he started to say something
2602860	2608980	else like that deal had just been sealed within the past 48 hours.
2608980	2611420	He wasn't quite prepared to say that.
2611420	2612740	That's how it came across to me.
2612740	2613980	That's what E3 is all about.
2613980	2615740	I have AT&T on my iPhone.
2615740	2617780	I'm one of those people that's like, whatever.
2617780	2618860	I'm hoping there's a deal.
2618860	2623060	As we have iPhone plans, that doesn't mean that we get on for free.
2623060	2624060	Yeah.
2624060	2627660	I'm not buying a 3G, PS, Vita, Velveeta, whatever.
2627660	2628660	Screw that.
2628660	2634820	Just, you know, tether to your iPhone or tether to, you know, whatever.
2634820	2637300	Well, let's talk about the Vita.
2637300	2640220	Bobby, I'll let you start it off since you were there.
2640220	2642420	What was kind of the reaction to the Vita that you saw?
2642420	2645340	What did you observe?
2645340	2650020	The people that were around me, they're like, okay, why are they saying that this is the
2650020	2654780	first time we've ever had augmented reality on a handheld because of the cameras?
2654780	2657420	And you know, why are they saying that this is the first time you've been able to do such
2657420	2661580	and such when they're like listing features in the 3DS?
2661580	2667060	But a lot of people are saying, you know, okay, I can see why they're doing it.
2667060	2670360	They think it's priced too high.
2670360	2675380	It's also the first time they've done it on a PlayStation Portable.
2675380	2683060	They have the camera for their stupid new iPad game and also for, what was it, the Invisimals
2683060	2684380	and stuff like that.
2684380	2688220	Well, interesting because a lot of the folks I was seeing online were really happy with
2688220	2692460	that price point saying, oh, Nintendo, Sony's coming after your 3DS.
2692460	2694780	Let me ask the chatters in our chat room.
2694780	2697720	Are you convinced you need a PlayStation Vita?
2697720	2699180	Why or why not?
2699180	2702100	How was your reaction to the price announcement?
2702100	2703100	So chat.orangelandre.com.
2703100	2712980	And here's one of the things that somebody said was that if it had HDMI output, sold.
2712980	2714340	Interesting.
2714340	2715340	What about that whole...
2715340	2716340	Now...
2716340	2717580	Go ahead.
2717580	2719280	I did not get the PlayStation Vita.
2719280	2722680	They had it there, but it was a long ass line.
2722680	2726900	And I decided that taking part in their distraction boos was more important.
2726900	2731260	So I haven't been able to play the Vita yet, but they did have it there.
2731260	2735940	But nobody I knew stood in the line because, like I said, there was distraction boos.
2735940	2736940	Right.
2736940	2737940	Right.
2737940	2742540	You were kind of talking about the whole HDMI out and all that.
2742540	2743540	One of the games that...
2743540	2746700	And I'm sure this was the one that caught most people's attention was The Ruin, the
2746700	2752620	dungeon crawler where they were playing it on the PSP and then did the transferring.
2752620	2754220	So it's not just Konami doing this.
2754220	2758260	Well, I guess it was a little different, but the transferring concept, I guess you could
2758260	2761740	say, where they stopped on the PSP and then went right over to the PS3 and kind of picked
2761740	2762740	it up.
2762740	2763740	Right.
2763740	2764740	Do they need...
2764740	2769260	Yeah, and the question that I have about that is, do you have to be a PlayStation Plus member
2769260	2771060	for the cloud savings?
2771060	2773180	I would think so, yes.
2773180	2775900	But obviously those are the details they want to leave out.
2775900	2778540	Let me get to some of the immediate chat comments about the Vita.
2778540	2782900	Tiger Claw says, I got to admit, the PS Vita for $249.99 is a pretty good price given all
2782900	2784980	the tech that's in it.
2784980	2789260	Savalas in our chat room says, does my new Vita have a firewall to protect me from hacks?
2789260	2793260	Janai says, I will buy one, but it will feel like an updated PSP.
2793260	2798580	Frisbee U says, nope, price is okay, but doesn't have any good games.
2798580	2804340	Zappi says, I need a Vita, Uncharted, Wipeout, Little Deviants, and LittleBigPlanet look
2804340	2806900	great.
2806900	2807900	So lots of...
2807900	2811820	Now, Tiger Claw says something here, and I want to kind of point this out.
2811820	2815200	He says the PS Vita produced PS3 quality graphics.
2815200	2817540	That is incorrect.
2817540	2824700	It is comparable to the PS3 because the Vita has a smaller resolution, but it could not
2824700	2828420	do 1080p PS3 quality graphics.
2828420	2831900	It's because of the resolution of the screen is not 1080p.
2831900	2837620	It's able, and it's also the screen is smaller, it's able to get away with making something
2837620	2841340	that is comparable to the PS3, but it is not exact to the PS3.
2841340	2844780	Hence why maybe the HDMI output may not be such a good idea.
2844780	2847140	It may kind of ruin the quality.
2847140	2848660	Right.
2848660	2852300	And then you're going to get something that looks a little more PS2-ish when you actually
2852300	2854300	hook it up to your TV.
2854300	2855300	Right.
2855300	2858780	Let's talk about some of the other stuff that happened at Sony's press conference.
2858780	2865340	What about, well, there was obviously some new core Sony games shown, Uncharted 3, Resistance
2865340	2866580	3.
2866580	2868820	Any reactions to that?
2868820	2873240	I thought the Uncharted 3 looked kind of cool because there was a very Helen Mirren slash
2873240	2877820	Dame Judi Dench-esque villain in it.
2877820	2878820	She was awesome.
2878820	2879820	Yeah.
2879820	2880820	It went over well.
2880820	2884340	Everybody liked that, and a lot of people around me are like, why are they...
2884340	2888740	Because the people that were around me in the VIP section, they were older than me.
2888740	2893020	And they're like, God, do we really need more 3D?
2893020	2894020	Do we really need more...
2894020	2897100	Why are they pushing the 3D stuff on me?
2897100	2899500	So that was kind of mixed in my area.
2899500	2903820	I think it got more pop up in the seat.
2903820	2912660	But what's interesting is that they had Ken Levine come out to talk about him doing the
2912660	2919820	Vita, and they did not show Ratchet & Clank, which they had back there, and they didn't
2919820	2924180	show Twisted Metal, which they had playable on that floor at the end.
2924180	2926700	And so they left some of those out.
2926700	2931420	The only game I played after that was Little Big Planet 2 with the Move support.
2931420	2934700	Oh, what'd you think?
2934700	2935700	They did...
2935700	2936780	It was kind of what we expected.
2936780	2938580	It's not Sackboy's prehistoric move.
2938580	2940360	They did something a little different.
2940360	2946140	And I got to play some of the story level from the one in their minigames.
2946140	2950980	And the main tool that they give you is, I think it's like the brain-inator or something,
2950980	2952660	but it's where you actually move things.
2952660	2956420	So you're still playing Little Big Planet exactly the way that you're used to, with
2956420	2962000	the buttons and the sticks and everything, and you're just moving things around and bouncing
2962000	2964220	yourself off with some of these.
2964220	2966960	And they did a really good job with it, and then they've got a minigame that they had
2966960	2972340	in the play, where it's one of those, it's kind of like cut the rope a little bit, where
2972340	2977660	there's a ball at the top and you're trying to get it to the end, but you have to place
2977660	2978660	things.
2978660	2982720	And then when you release the ball, it kind of goes through this Rube Goldberg machine
2982720	2983720	that you've created.
2983720	2984720	Interesting.
2984720	2986720	And that was kind of neat.
2986720	2990980	So this is something that's going to be like free patch, free upgrade for Little Big Planet
2990980	2992580	2, right?
2992580	2993580	I believe so.
2993580	2995300	It's not something I'm going to have to buy separately.
2995300	2999460	And they better, because on the box of Little Big Planet 2, it says, better with PlayStation
2999460	3000460	Move.
3000460	3004380	It's got the Move logo, but it's not part of the game right now.
3004380	3008900	So I think that'd be kind of stupid if they put that on the box and then said, oh, but
3008900	3012300	you got to pay extra to get that part that's in the blue sticker on the front of the box.
3012300	3014100	It's just better if you own it.
3014100	3016100	It just makes you feel good.
3016100	3018180	Let me go to this comment in our chat room about the Move.
3018180	3023420	Technis says, was it me or was the Move almost nonexistent in the entire press conference
3023420	3025900	except for maybe four mentions and a game demo?
3025900	3030100	And yeah, that medieval game they were showing that used the Move, medieval moves, Deadman's
3030100	3035980	Quest, I got to admit, well, the facilitator they had doing it was probably their weakest
3035980	3037300	one of the whole press conference.
3037300	3038300	And I was-
3038300	3039300	Good job, Jeremy.
3039300	3040300	I was a little underwhelmed.
3040300	3041300	Good job, Jeremy.
3041300	3042300	I was a little underwhelmed.
3042300	3047580	Wasn't that the same guy that like showed up the stupid medieval tech demo last time
3047580	3052100	when they were first showing off the Move stuff?
3052100	3055900	The medieval tech demo last time was the sports champions thing, I think.
3055900	3056900	Yeah.
3056900	3057900	I think it's changed quite a bit.
3057900	3058900	I don't think...
3058900	3062060	Some of the ideas are probably still there, but I don't think any of the assets or anything
3062060	3063060	is still the same.
3063060	3065980	When they first showed it off, he was the guy demoing it.
3065980	3066980	Hmm.
3066980	3067980	Oh, same demo-er?
3067980	3068980	Maybe.
3068980	3073500	One of the other big moments of the Sony press conference was a special unannounced guest.
3073500	3075220	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3075220	3076220	What?
3076220	3077220	What?
3077220	3078220	There was another move being shown.
3078220	3079220	What's that?
3079220	3081100	Kobe Bryant came out and sucked at it.
3081100	3082780	I was just about to say that.
3082780	3086600	Yeah, the other big guest that was at Sony's press conference was the Kobe Bryant moment.
3086600	3089620	And I tweeted you and I'm like, quick, throw your shoe.
3089620	3090620	What kind of...
3090620	3092900	Yeah, but I liked my shoe too much.
3092900	3095860	What kind of reaction did Kobe get from the crowd?
3095860	3097260	Because it sounded very mixed.
3097260	3098260	It was...
3098260	3105140	I mean, he got some pops and, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, when he kind of made jokes
3105140	3107620	about himself or something, that got some reaction.
3107620	3111660	But it was, you know, we had partially a lot of answers for him.
3111660	3112660	Right, right.
3112660	3116860	It was a pretty resounding endorsement by him as well.
3116860	3121180	I mean, I'm sure he gets paid handsomely to say it, but still, you know, you couldn't
3121180	3125340	help but feel the little punch in the gut to EA after what happened to them last year.
3125340	3133460	So one of the big, big buzz things that happened at the Sony press conference was those 3D
3133460	3134460	monitors.
3134460	3139340	And, you know, one thing Sony has definitely learned from the past is how to get a price
3139340	3140340	right.
3140340	3144860	Because, you know, when the PlayStation 3 was first announced, there was a lot of heckling.
3144860	3147500	But now a lot of folks say the Vita is priced right.
3147500	3155260	And now a 3D television with resistance 3, 3D glasses, HDMI cable, $499.
3155260	3157060	3D monitor.
3157060	3163340	3D monitor, oh, so it won't actually get TV signal.
3163340	3164860	I guess it probably doesn't have an accessibility.
3164860	3168940	And it's probably, it's probably going to be sized like your computer monitor.
3168940	3171460	Like I don't know if they said what size it was.
3171460	3172460	24 inch.
3172460	3174180	24, so you're right on the money.
3174180	3175180	Yeah, 24 inch.
3175180	3177340	So that that's not really TV.
3177340	3178340	That's a monitor.
3178340	3181940	Also, I wanted to mention something because I know I'm going to go back, I'm watching
3181940	3182940	chat too.
3182940	3183940	That's fine.
3183940	3187660	Randy, you that E3 is the only place you can see Kobe play in June.
3187660	3191940	Actually most times at E3, the LA Lakers are in the NBA finals and we have to fight them
3191940	3194220	because the Staples Center is right next to E3.
3194220	3195220	That's true.
3195220	3197160	I'm actually glad he's not playing in June because that's hell.
3197160	3203220	Me too because that means traffic on Thursday won't be as bad as it was the year before.
3203220	3207660	But yeah, so well, I thought it was interesting the way he marketed it when they were, when
3207660	3209800	he was mentioning the new monitor.
3209800	3211460	It's perfect for a dorm room.
3211460	3216060	I thought that right there was like a huge, like we know exactly who needs this and who
3216060	3217500	our audience is for this.
3217500	3219060	And I think that was right on the money.
3219060	3225700	I think that's going to cause this thing to get on a lot of college wish lists this year.
3225700	3226700	So we'll see.
3226700	3227700	Except for me.
3227700	3228700	Except for you.
3228700	3229700	Not interested?
3229700	3232000	Oh yeah, because you don't, you don't do 3D.
3232000	3234960	I can't see the 3D and actually it screwed me up.
3234960	3240160	Like I was, because I was so close and at an angle and I put those glasses on because
3240160	3243040	they were showing a lot of us, a lot of trailers in 3D.
3243040	3249320	It was actually messing me up because I usually like, if I'm like looking straight at it,
3249320	3250320	it's fine.
3250320	3254420	Like it's just a darker 2D except for maybe some things that the edges, but being at that
3254420	3257080	angle, it, it sucks.
3257080	3262300	Now one thing that they said they were going to do with the 3D technology, this is the
3262300	3266140	stuff with the technology that I really am looking forward to and I would actually be
3266140	3273100	confused, is because they do the stutter technology, they have, you know, they actually implemented,
3273100	3276920	and I don't know if they're showing it here or not, where, you know, instead of having
3276920	3281320	each eye shutter differently, they have each pair of glasses shutter differently, you can
3281320	3287020	actually have two different screens, or people seeing two different images on the screen.
3287020	3288020	That is awesome.
3288020	3292480	Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too and very Wave of the Future, very much so.
3292480	3296100	So I want to get to Nintendo here in a minute, but a couple of things I've got to, got to
3296100	3299580	mention out of the Sony press conference, we won't have time to hit everything, but
3299580	3305340	Dar Sakura, I know you had been looking at Star Trek the game and some of the announces
3305340	3306340	that were made around that.
3306340	3310100	Did you hear about the PlayStation move that's going to look like a phaser?
3310100	3312280	Why am I so not surprised either?
3312280	3315580	I, I, I'm not going to lie, it sounds kind of awesome actually.
3315580	3317820	I don't own a move yet and now I want to hold out and get one.
3317820	3320620	I would only have a move if it looked like a phaser.
3320620	3325060	I mean it really depends, like they didn't show a lot of the playable game and I don't
3325060	3327340	know if it's out there on the, well probably not, it's still a ways out and they don't
3327340	3328340	want to see the movie.
3328340	3329340	It's pre-alpha right now.
3329340	3330340	No, no, no.
3330340	3331780	I'm trying to get an appointment to see the game.
3331780	3332940	Oh, ho, ho, I hope you do.
3332940	3333940	I really hope you do.
3333940	3334940	I hope so too.
3334940	3335940	Yeah.
3335940	3337940	I want to count the lens flares.
3337940	3341780	But with anything that new, I'm going to keep my judgment reserved.
3341780	3342780	Right.
3342780	3344100	I don't think you can count that high.
3344100	3347780	But I mean they are investing a lot in this because it wasn't just this official game,
3347780	3353980	but I guess a PSN precursor, I guess what comes to mind, Dead Rising 2K0-esque thing
3353980	3359140	for the Star Wars game, or excuse me, Star Trek game is supposed to be there as well.
3359140	3362180	More information next year, a little closer to the movie's launch I'm sure.
3362180	3365940	Loki, I got to let you have a moment because they did mention at the PlayStation 3 conference
3365940	3370060	exclusives coming to Saints Row the 3rd and I know you've got to have an opinion on that
3370060	3371060	game.
3371060	3373140	I don't really care about the exclusives that they have coming to that.
3373140	3374700	I'm still getting on 360.
3374700	3375700	Really?
3375700	3376740	But what about the game itself?
3376740	3379180	The game is fucking amazing.
3379180	3384940	I saw some gameplay footage they had during an interview prior to one of the conferences
3384940	3393220	and they have a guy just doing wrestling moves on random pedestrians and then they even showed
3393220	3396900	the giant purple dildo weapon and stuff like that.
3396900	3401300	They're talking about the vehicle that you can suck people up into it and launch them
3401300	3403300	back out.
3403300	3406140	It's going to be awesome.
3406140	3411380	Basically they said that their goal was to make the most over the top game possible and
3411380	3415660	everything that they asked to do in there, where they thought they would truly get turned
3415660	3417940	down, they're like, nah, go ahead and do that.
3417940	3419260	So I can't wait.
3419260	3422060	I have to admit, I approve of that approach.
3422060	3423060	You know what?
3423060	3424060	Go big.
3424060	3429580	But here's the thing too, I watched this morning the trailer, they have a new trailer out there
3429580	3435020	for Postal 3 and I got to tell you, it looks like shit.
3435020	3436900	Because they're like, oh, look how edgy we are.
3436900	3440180	No, I'm sorry, Saints Row 3 blows that shit away.
3440180	3444500	Who gives a fuck that you have a guy dressed up like a nut sack?
3444500	3445500	Who cares?
3445500	3449700	There's a weapon that's a giant purple penis that you can hit people with in Saints Row
3449700	3450700	3.
3450700	3453500	If you want to do edgy, you're going to have to make a game based on the Human Centipede
3453500	3456100	part 2.
3456100	3461340	I don't know how much room we have for masturbating with barbed wire in a...
3461340	3466340	Hey, did you see on the PS Vita, and Dan, I know you are a Fighting Game fan stream.
3466340	3467340	Well, hang on.
3467340	3468340	Hang on.
3468340	3469340	Yeah, yeah.
3469340	3470340	I want to interject on the Saints Row thing real quick.
3470340	3471340	Go for it.
3471340	3477460	Because I haven't seen it yet, but they have done the most genius marketing here at E3.
3477460	3478460	What's that?
3478460	3484340	They bought or rented out for the week that parking lot across the street from Staples
3484340	3489100	Center and have offered free parking to all E3 attendees that get in there.
3489100	3493280	They have bikini models at the entrance trying to direct people in.
3493280	3497540	They've got tents in there, and they've got it all decked out in Saints Row.
3497540	3498540	Awesome.
3498540	3501860	I know where we're going Thursday.
3501860	3502860	No doubt.
3502860	3503860	All right.
3503860	3509020	Dan, I know you're a Fighting Game fan.
3509020	3511020	Jamie's giving her husband a stare down.
3511020	3512020	What?
3512020	3513020	Jamie, come on.
3513020	3514020	You know you want to see...
3514020	3515020	You know, this is radio, so no one can see that.
3515020	3518020	Jamie, even you have to admit boobies.
3518020	3522920	I just didn't want him to get to the boobies first.
3522920	3523920	There we go.
3523920	3526460	There'll be plenty of boobies to go around at E3.
3526460	3527460	Even I'll get some boobies.
3527460	3528460	All right.
3528460	3529460	Word.
3529460	3530460	And you'll like them.
3530460	3533700	Let me ask this question real quick, because you're a Fighting Game fan.
3533700	3537620	On the Vita, Street Fighter crossed Tekken, some of the first kind of footage of that
3537620	3538620	game in action.
3538620	3539620	You're a fan?
3539620	3540620	You a fan, Dark Zyra?
3540620	3541620	He want.
3541620	3542620	She loves Tekken.
3542620	3543620	Yeah?
3543620	3544620	Are you kind of...
3544620	3545620	Nah.
3545620	3546620	You feeling a little...
3546620	3549380	Like a 2D fighter?
3549380	3550380	Well it's that whole...
3550380	3551380	Made out of a 3D fighter?
3551380	3552380	Yeah.
3552380	3553380	Well...
3553380	3554380	It'll be cool.
3554380	3555380	That got very little reaction.
3555380	3556380	Well, it was...
3556380	3560380	The thing was, it was weird to me, because as much as I like that idea of Street Fighter
3560380	3565140	crossed Tekken, then they announced, okay, so it's Street Fighter world and Tekken world
3565140	3570600	collides, and then we're going to throw in Cole from Infamous, and it's like, what does
3570600	3572440	he have to do with anything?
3572440	3574460	Because Namco likes throwing in random characters.
3574460	3579020	Like, if we're going to put our Tekken franchise on the line here, we've got to have random
3579020	3581580	people who have nothing to do with the universe in it.
3581580	3584380	We can't have Darth Vader, so here's Cole.
3584380	3587860	Actually, since Namco's involved, why didn't they just put Kratos in there?
3587860	3588860	I know, right?
3588860	3590140	Everybody would have gave a shit if it was Kratos.
3590140	3593220	Besides, wouldn't it be funny just to see Kratos just hacking up Ryu?
3593220	3596220	Well, there's also that moment where, well, Kratos has now kind of already been done this
3596220	3599980	year in Mortal Kombat, so it would be a little much to do another fighter back to back like
3599980	3600980	that.
3600980	3602980	Oh yeah, he's in Mortal Kombat, he's not in Soul Calibur.
3602980	3603980	Yeah.
3603980	3608860	They needed, though, instead of Cole, they needed the iPad, have the iPad fucking shit
3608860	3609860	up in there.
3609860	3610860	No, they needed Sackboy.
3610860	3611860	Sackboy?
3611860	3612860	No, no, no, no.
3612860	3613860	Sackboy would have been amazing.
3613860	3614860	Now you guys are getting stupid.
3614860	3618740	No, no, no, it's not stupid, because keep in mind, Tekken 3, we had Gon.
3618740	3619740	That's right, you do have Panda.
3619740	3620740	Sackboy.
3620740	3625900	No, well Panda and Kuma were always part of the story, but, I mean, freaking Gon.
3625900	3629460	There's a bear fighting here, but, oh, Sackboy, that's ridiculous.
3629460	3630460	That's silly.
3630460	3633620	Oh, but you're playing a chibi dinosaur.
3633620	3634620	You can have shit.
3634620	3635620	You can punch him.
3635620	3639540	You can, oh, actually, I can make it all the way through Tekken Street mode with Gon.
3639540	3644780	All right, we gotta get to the next press conference this morning, Nintendo.
3644780	3646580	Let's talk about Nintendo for a little bit.
3646580	3650780	I'm gonna leave the room so that I can actually hear Loki without going deaf.
3650780	3651780	What's that, Bobby?
3651780	3654540	You don't want me to talk about James' addiction?
3654540	3656300	Do you want to, oh, yes!
3656300	3661060	I totally forgot to ask Bobby about what happened behind the scenes at the Sony press conference
3661060	3665340	before we get to Nintendo, because, yo, when we're watching at home, it cuts out at the
3665340	3668420	end, but you were there for, what, like two and a half more hours, right?
3668420	3671100	Yeah, it ended at 10.
3671100	3672100	Wow.
3672100	3673100	So what was happening, James?
3673100	3677300	Basically, at the end of the press conference, the entire stage went away, and that's where
3677300	3682340	all their demo kiosks were, and they brought food, lots of food, like grilled cheese sandwiches
3682340	3689580	and pasta salad and cookies and cupcakes and other, like, it was great.
3689580	3694220	And then beer and alcohol flowing open bar, and then at nine o'clock, James' Addiction
3694220	3695220	comes on.
3695220	3696220	Oh, James Addiction.
3696220	3699580	I'm like, okay, I saw them in Activision last year, so I'm good.
3699580	3703100	But they came out and did an hour set.
3703100	3706780	And for no particular reason than, hey, we got James Addiction, because we're Sony.
3706780	3708940	They better have been caught stealing.
3708940	3711380	They had Mixmaster Mike there, too.
3711380	3713380	I love him, too.
3713380	3714380	Yeah.
3714380	3715380	Wow.
3715380	3722420	But him, they had all their trailers of their games, but it was messing with the color and
3722420	3725220	everything, and that was kind of the visuals around.
3725220	3731260	But they also had all these, like, scantily clad women on top of the stage's areas that
3731260	3737260	were still doing, like, doing slow dances and stuff, and it was the techno music.
3737260	3740780	And it was kind of weird, because we're sitting there playing video games while there's, like,
3740780	3747180	a hot chick above us, like, kind of doing a pole game.
3747180	3748660	So I guess they knew their audience.
3748660	3749660	All right.
3749660	3752260	So, and how many Sony beers did you have again?
3752260	3753680	What?
3753680	3755820	How many Sony beers did you have again?
3755820	3759460	Honestly, because they had crappy beers, only one.
3759460	3761980	Tonight is the night that I'm going to have way too many beers.
3761980	3762980	All right, all right.
3762980	3763980	Well, then we gotta, we gotta get-
3763980	3764980	They had crappy beer?
3764980	3765980	I'm so sorry.
3765980	3770660	We gotta get through Nintendo's press conference so that Bobby can get to the beer drinking.
3770660	3771660	But you know what?
3771660	3775100	Bobby, with all due respect, I gotta let Loki kick this one off.
3775100	3779460	So Loki, why don't you give us a little report on Nintendo's press conference?
3779460	3788900	So Nintendo came out and basically showed off some of their 3DS stuff, and no one cared.
3788900	3789900	No.
3789900	3794740	No, they talked, first they started off actually by talking about the Zelda 25th anniversary
3794740	3795740	edition.
3795740	3796740	Which was awesome.
3796740	3798540	Which, you know, they had, like, an orchestra.
3798540	3804220	They had an orchestra, and they had Miyamoto out there, and my Zelda fanboy soul was like,
3804220	3805220	yes!
3805220	3806580	It was beautiful.
3806580	3810500	And then they were talking about how they're kind of celebrating it on all the different
3810500	3811500	platforms.
3811500	3817540	For the 3DS, of course you had, you know, the Game Boy Color Zelda game that's available
3817540	3818540	for download on there.
3818540	3821460	It's gonna be the first one in the Game Boy Color Virtual Console lineup.
3821460	3823660	I bought it.
3823660	3826180	Sucker!
3826180	3833260	And then for the Nintendo Wii, obviously, you know, Skyward Sword is gonna be available
3833260	3835040	later this year.
3835040	3840340	For the DSiWare, which I'm assuming also means the 3DS as well, they're gonna have Zelda
3840340	3844460	the Four Swords Adventure as a free download, which is kinda cool.
3844460	3848660	Too bad that's not playable by itself, though.
3848660	3858900	And then of course they're also gonna do some sort of pre-order bonus for the 3DS with Ocarina.
3858900	3864940	That you're gonna be able to get a music CD with the soundtrack from the game for if you
3864940	3872080	register the game quite early on the Nintendo, you know, club thing.
3872080	3878020	And then of course they're gonna do some sort of orchestra, you know, live shows and stuff
3878020	3879860	like that with the Zelda music.
3879860	3881820	It's gonna be all over the world.
3881820	3887140	And then they're gonna have a CD for that that's gonna be available with the Skyward
3887140	3889020	Sword game.
3889020	3892620	And then 3DS stuff, they showed off, you know, the new Mario game, which looks kinda cool.
3892620	3898160	It's kind of like a cross between Mario Galaxy and like Mario 64, which is not bad.
3898160	3901380	And then Star Fox, they showed a little bit of that.
3901380	3906780	I mean, it's just souped up Star Fox 64.
3906780	3907780	What else did they show?
3907780	3913300	Luigi's Mansion 2, which is, you know, supposed to be, you know, brand new for that and stuff.
3913300	3917300	And I called that there was gonna be an augmented reality game where you hunt ghosts with the
3917300	3918300	camera.
3918300	3921420	I still think there is, but they just haven't announced that yet because it makes sense.
3921420	3923860	With like the Face Raiders stuff.
3923860	3929020	I just wanna know why Luigi's Mansion, because the first one was crap.
3929020	3930020	It has its fans.
3930020	3934180	Actually the best part of it was when you went into the attic and then the lightning
3934180	3938780	would flash and then his shadow would be hanging by a noose.
3938780	3942260	So and then, okay, so they do the Kid Icarus and all these 3DS games.
3942260	3945060	The Kid Icarus and then Mario Kart, what the fuck's up with Mario Kart, okay?
3945060	3950960	Mario Kart, now with, you know, monster trucks and, you know, hang gliders.
3950960	3951960	And that's innovative.
3951960	3955940	And they were like, you've never, you've never raced this game before.
3955940	3960380	And like all the first few tracks that they were showing were all tracks from other games.
3960380	3967060	I'm like, actually, yes, I have raced every single one of those.
3967060	3971820	And then they decide, hey, you know what, let's talk about this new console that we've
3971820	3972860	got.
3972860	3975260	And of course what they do, they don't show the console, because, you know, that would
3975260	3976260	be too easy.
3976260	3979980	So they show the controller and the controller is basically everything that was rumored to
3979980	3980980	be.
3980980	3985100	It's, you know, it looks like it's made out of the plastic that's from the nunchuck or
3985100	3986100	something like that.
3986100	3991300	It's got the tiny stuff and it's got the, you know, 6.2 inch touch screen.
3991300	3994540	And then they go to say, hey, what are we calling this thing?
3994540	3999220	Uh, well, you know how everybody hated the name Wii, but then they eventually got used
3999220	4000620	to it and stuff.
4000620	4002620	We got another one for you.
4002620	4003620	Wii U.
4003620	4004620	What?
4004620	4009460	I, like, seriously, they said Wii U is the name of that.
4009460	4010940	I was like, what?
4010940	4014380	My brain hurts for how stupid this is.
4014380	4017140	But, you know, people will get used to it.
4017140	4020220	They could still change their mind.
4020220	4023940	You know, Dan and I were saying before the show, like, what if they had just called it
4023940	4025000	the Nintendo U?
4025000	4029620	I think that would have been, like, U as in Ultra IDK, like, I think Nintendo U would
4029620	4030620	have been fine.
4030620	4031620	No, well, here's the problem.
4031620	4035460	They have to do Wii because people are fucking stupid and they're not gonna understand.
4035460	4039840	I can use my Wii stuff with, see, then they know that they can use their Wii stuff with
4039840	4040840	it.
4040840	4041840	Great.
4041840	4047780	The problem is, is already everyone's kind of half assuming, I thought it was a new system,
4047780	4050780	not just a new controller.
4050780	4051780	And it is a new system.
4051780	4052780	It is a new system.
4052780	4053780	Dura does HD.
4053780	4054780	People don't know that.
4054780	4057820	They're just like, oh, I just use it with my existing Wii.
4057820	4065340	I know Bobby is dying to jump in here in a minute here, but let me let Loki wrap up here.
4065340	4069100	What other impressions did Wii U leave you with?
4069100	4075500	It's a neat piece of hardware, but it just seems so gimmicky to me.
4075500	4076500	I'm sorry.
4076500	4079300	It's just, how expensive is it?
4079300	4082500	Some of the graphics, like their little tech demo pre-rendered thing looked kind of cool
4082500	4083860	and what it does.
4083860	4086620	But the whole conference, they didn't fucking announce anything.
4086620	4087620	Oh, okay.
4087620	4092920	They hinted that Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and 3DS.
4092920	4093920	They hinted at that.
4093920	4096940	And then they said, oh, but that's gonna be a while now.
4096940	4099460	Yeah, just like they hinted at Pikmin coming out.
4099460	4100900	And how long has that been?
4100900	4103340	Oh, wait, it's still not out yet.
4103340	4107580	So Smash Brothers, oh, let's get them all excited and promise this game that's not gonna
4107580	4110020	come out for two years.
4110020	4117140	And then Wii U, and I'm sorry, it's just, like the tech demos they showed off, it's
4117140	4122460	like, oh, hey, look, I can play Wii Sports Golf and I can put this controller on the
4122460	4125580	ground and make it so I can see a ball there and stuff.
4125580	4127460	All right, Bobby's been waiting patiently.
4127460	4132220	Bobby, what do you think about them showing just a controller and not really showing the
4132220	4134140	specs of the console off?
4134140	4138460	Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.
4138460	4139460	Sorry.
4139460	4141460	Gun pal under the piss.
4141460	4143460	Is there a fire truck driving by?
4143460	4150020	So, well, first I want to jump in because we started with the 3DS stuff.
4150020	4152020	Sure, go ahead.
4152020	4156500	And I do want to mention that I have, like, 100 street pass me now.
4156500	4157500	It's, like, awesome.
4157500	4162260	I've almost got, like, all the puzzle pieces of all puzzles.
4162260	4170620	But I played Mario Kart 3DS because they had a couple of games out in intense and stuff.
4170620	4173260	And I actually did play it and I enjoyed it.
4173260	4174260	It is Mario Kart.
4174260	4178980	I mean, all the same tricks on how to, you know, boost around corners and stuff is still
4178980	4180520	there and stuff.
4180520	4184580	But to me, it was Mario Kart meets Diddy Kong Racing.
4184580	4186860	How so?
4186860	4190780	With all the different ways that you could, you know, like, either you would be a plane
4190780	4195140	or you'd go underwater, which they didn't really do underwater in Diddy Kong Racing.
4195140	4201140	But, like, with the planes and stuff and monster trucks and having the different types of vehicles
4201140	4202140	and stuff.
4202140	4203660	So that's kind of what it reminded me of.
4203660	4210500	But it was still Mario Kart and, you know, it's, for fans of Mario Kart, it's a lot of
4210500	4211500	it.
4211500	4212500	Yeah.
4212500	4213500	See, that's the problem right there.
4213500	4214500	Okay?
4214500	4216980	Here's basically what Nintendo's innovation is.
4216980	4218180	All right.
4218180	4219940	What can we add to this to make it better?
4219940	4223180	Oh, let's add some more vehicle types.
4223180	4225640	Do people really give a shit about more vehicle types?
4225640	4228760	What they want you to do is they want you to come up with some new tracks and stop fucking
4228760	4231880	repeating tracks from every goddamn game that you've already released.
4231880	4236620	It would be nice to hear just a tinge about the online capability because 3DS already
4236620	4238300	has better online than the Wii.
4238300	4241940	So it'd be, I would like to hear more about that, but Bobby?
4241940	4246940	Well, I mean, the tracks that they had in the demo that I played, you know, because
4246940	4251980	the ones, like, that went underwater, you know, and there is, you know, different physics
4251980	4252980	underwater.
4252980	4256580	And, you know, gliding through the air and having to determine where you're going to
4256580	4258620	glide and when you're going to go up and down.
4258620	4261700	So I mean, the demo had new tracks.
4261700	4264700	I don't recognize any of the tracks that were in the demo.
4264700	4269820	Now, the trailer probably showed tracks that you might have seen, you know, segments of
4269820	4274620	tracks that you've seen before, but, you know, like, yeah, there's a track that looks like
4274620	4278660	the Donkey Kong tracks from the N64, but it's not the same layout.
4278660	4282060	It just has the same scenery.
4282060	4289300	So don't write it off based on the three second stiffness in the trailer because it does change
4289300	4290300	it enough.
4290300	4295580	Yes, it's still Mario Kart, and yes, it's still, you know, not new but fun, maybe.
4295580	4296580	I don't know.
4296580	4297580	It's just like how they thought-
4297580	4300580	You know, a lot of people are like, what's wrong with more of what I like?
4300580	4304340	It's just like how they thought it was necessary to put motorcycles in the Wii version.
4304340	4305340	Who gives a shit?
4305340	4306340	It's a kart racing game.
4306340	4307340	You don't need fucking motorcycles.
4307340	4309620	Oh, now let's put monster trucks in there.
4309620	4310620	Who cares?
4310620	4312780	Well, then it would be more like a side truck if they did that.
4312780	4313780	Look at-
4313780	4314780	No, no.
4314780	4315780	See, here's what they do if it's a side truck.
4315780	4319220	Oh, let's put jet engines in there and put, you know, let's put boats.
4319220	4320220	All right.
4320220	4321220	Look-
4321220	4322220	Excite boats.
4322220	4323220	Since we're talking 3DS, let me throw out-
4323220	4324220	That's going to happen.
4324220	4325700	We've just put that out in the atmosphere.
4325700	4328700	Nintendo right now has just started to work on excite boats.
4328700	4331020	Let me throw out this question for the chat room.
4331020	4337380	For all you folks in chat who do not currently own a 3DS, are you interested in 3DS now?
4337380	4339180	They showed more titles.
4339180	4342800	I thought it was interesting, and that's the question I've got for our chat, chat.orangetouch.com.
4342800	4344660	Are you interested in a 3DS now?
4344660	4348500	Because I thought it was interesting because leading into that, Reggie, and Reggie just
4348500	4350460	showed why he was Reggie.
4350460	4353980	And he said something, and Bobby, maybe you can help fill me in here.
4353980	4358740	He said something like, well, you want to see the same old stuff again, but you want
4358740	4359740	to see innovation.
4359740	4363740	And he goes kind of like, conflict, fine.
4363740	4364740	We can handle that.
4364740	4365740	That's our industry.
4365740	4366740	Here you go.
4366740	4369220	We're fucking Nintendo.
4369220	4370220	Suck it down.
4370220	4371220	Yes.
4371220	4372220	Let's see innovation.
4372220	4374260	Hey, you will like it.
4374260	4376620	Let's talk innovation, Nintendo.
4376620	4377620	Let's start off.
4377620	4380620	Innovation is deeper and wider.
4380620	4381620	That's what she said.
4381620	4382620	What?
4382620	4383620	What?
4383620	4384620	No.
4384620	4387700	Let's talk innovation here, Nintendo.
4387700	4389660	Animal Crossing.
4389660	4392340	Now you can sit on park benches and go swimming.
4392340	4394620	It's the same fucking game still.
4394620	4395620	Same damn game.
4395620	4396620	Same everything.
4396620	4397620	There's the same patterns.
4397620	4398860	I even saw the screenshots.
4398860	4404060	The same fucking patterns that have been in that game since it first came out on the goddamn
4404060	4406180	GameCube or in this stupid game.
4406180	4408460	Actually, it came out on Nintendo 64.
4408460	4412420	I understand that, but over here- For God's sake, it's fucking Animal Crossing.
4412420	4413580	Who cares?
4413580	4414900	I care because you know what?
4414900	4418660	They get away with this shit with every goddamn franchise that they have because their fans
4418660	4419660	love it.
4419660	4420660	You know what?
4420660	4421660	Your fucking Smash Brothers come out.
4421660	4424460	I bet you that it's going to be all the fucking same characters again.
4424460	4427980	Fuck, they're just going to pork that shit from the Wii is what's going to end up happening.
4427980	4429820	But that's what makes it a franchise.
4429820	4430820	Dark Sakura.
4430820	4432820	I want it.
4432820	4434580	I want the Smash Brothers too.
4434580	4435580	Animal Crossing.
4435580	4440580	I was actually going to start playing my GBA one again.
4440580	4444140	Then I have to ask as a follow-up, why?
4444140	4449620	Because I watched the anime last night and it was super cute and I was like, I remember
4449620	4450660	this in the game.
4450660	4452300	I remember that in the game.
4452300	4453460	I miss playing it.
4453460	4454460	You can ask Dan.
4454460	4455460	He was here the whole time.
4455460	4459460	As soon as they took out Unlock-A-Whole-Nest games, fuck that franchise.
4459460	4464300	Bobby, do you think it's odd that they left Animal Crossing and Paper Mario out of the
4464300	4465300	conference totally?
4465300	4469860	Well, except for, I guess, logos at the end?
4469860	4475380	I think that they felt they had enough that they were showing that they didn't teach you.
4475380	4480100	What I was actually surprised at is that there were no live demos of games.
4480100	4485460	They didn't bring those two out to show people.
4485460	4488020	Is that maybe because the whole 3D, 2D thing?
4488020	4490820	No, no, I'm talking about the Wii U.
4490820	4491820	Oh, excuse me.
4491820	4492820	I moved on already.
4492820	4493820	Oh, sorry, sorry.
4493820	4494820	But they didn't bring it out.
4494820	4498100	They showed videos, but I'm like, is it even here?
4498100	4500820	Because I'm seeing all these conceptual videos and stuff.
4500820	4505700	I didn't even think it was even at E3, because usually they would have brought it out or
4505700	4506700	something.
4506700	4508220	Tethered to lovely-looking ladies, right?
4508220	4509220	Yeah.
4509220	4512180	Let me get to some of the feedback from our chat room on the 3DS, and then we'll move
4512180	4513180	into Wii U.
4513180	4515980	For the non-3DS owners, are you interested in a 3DS now?
4515980	4520180	Gio Videa says, no, can't use the 3D on the 3DS anyway.
4520180	4521900	Burr says, still not interested.
4521900	4524140	Dungeon Buster, not really.
4524140	4527620	Blender, not interested in the 3DS at all.
4527620	4528620	So there's some of the negatives.
4528620	4530620	But then we get some other positives.
4530620	4532020	Dark Tetsuya, oh, definitely.
4532020	4533220	New Mario Kart looks neat.
4533220	4534220	Yay, Tanooki suit.
4534220	4538620	I think he might be, or was Tanooki suit in Mario Kart, or is he just blurring the other
4538620	4539620	Mario game?
4539620	4540620	He's talking about the...
4540620	4541620	He's blurring them.
4541620	4542620	All right.
4542620	4544180	Defective Candy says, no, I'm not impressed with the 3DS.
4544180	4547540	Lacklustre title still, and the system was not even done when it came out.
4547540	4550620	I'll stick to my DSi until they discontinue making games for it.
4550620	4553420	Frisbee U, no, we don't want to see the same stuff again.
4553420	4558260	Technus, I want Star Fox 64 3DS, but the picture thing was so fucking stupid.
4558260	4559260	So no.
4559260	4562500	Interesting, because there's not a lot of yeses.
4562500	4565820	And here's the thing about Star Fox, that he was talking about fucking innovation, how
4565820	4571380	you can tilt it to, you know, you can optionally, I guess, tilt it to control, you know, your
4571380	4572380	ship.
4572380	4575740	Yeah, except it fucks up the 3D when you do that, dumbass.
4575740	4577300	Oh, no kidding.
4577300	4581860	Let's put tilt controls on a 3D game that requires you to keep the system at an actual
4581860	4586020	view so that you can see the 3D.
4586020	4589140	I guess that's for people who don't give a shit about 3D, but then again, why the fuck
4589140	4591540	are you buying, you know, a 3DS sim?
4591540	4595300	Or better yet, why the fuck are you buying a game that came out on the Nintendo 64?
4595300	4597660	Oh, because that's innovation for Nintendo.
4597660	4600580	We can port old shit and make it slightly better.
4600580	4601780	The hobby wants to jump in.
4601780	4608540	Well, I mean, I am a 3DS because it's a higher resolution top screen.
4608540	4613900	For me as well, like, I bought a 3DS because I skipped the DSi and I skipped the DSi XL
4613900	4617340	and I, you know, the last one I had owned was a DS Lite, so I thought, eh, it's time
4617340	4618340	for upgrade.
4618340	4619340	Why not?
4619340	4620340	That's why I did it.
4620340	4624700	But anyway, let's move on to Wii U because I know Bobby wants to move on.
4624700	4627580	Let me throw a question out to chat that we'll get to in a minute.
4627580	4632360	And then I want to talk, Bobby, your time with the hands-on Wii U.
4632360	4636980	On a scale of 1 to 10, chatters, 10 being very and 1 being not at all, I'm sounding
4636980	4641000	like a club Nintendo survey, but I'm just kind of curious here, 1 being not at all,
4641000	4643420	how interested are you in Wii U?
4643420	4646860	Scale of 1 to 10, 1 not at all, 10 very.
4646860	4653980	Bobby, you got your hands on it after four hours of waiting, right?
4653980	4655980	What do you think?
4655980	4660320	First off, what I want to say is I want to give a history lesson.
4660320	4665920	Back in 2005 at Nintendo's press conference, they decided that they were going to show
4665920	4669620	this brand new revolutionary control scheme.
4669620	4677740	And they showed the remote and they did, you know, that was when, you know, Miyamoto came
4677740	4680460	out, flashing Zelda swords and all that stuff.
4680460	4681820	And they showed it.
4681820	4686300	And when you played the games, you realized they were running on Gamecubes.
4686300	4690300	And that's where the whole joke of two Gamecubes tucked together came from.
4690300	4695340	In 2006, they actually showed the console that the controller was for.
4695340	4702220	Fast forward to 2011, they are showing the controller for their next console, but they're
4702220	4704340	not telling you that much about the console itself.
4704340	4707900	They're focusing on the input mechanism.
4707900	4711020	Next year, we're actually going to see more of the console.
4711020	4718620	Now, the demos that they're showing here are running on new hardware, but it's not like
4718620	4722160	they even like to show a box there, but I was actually told that's not running anything.
4722160	4727180	It's like running, there's a PC back there, running a, you know, a souped-up Wii dev kit.
4727180	4728900	And that's what they're running things off of.
4728900	4731380	So they're not ready to talk about the console yet.
4731380	4737180	They're trying to get people to concentrate on the controller and the conceptual demos.
4737180	4742700	There is not a single retail game being shown, except, well, okay, there's one retail game
4742700	4746500	and it's a third-party game that's being shown here at E3 for the Wii U.
4746500	4748940	So I kind of wanted to straighten that out.
4748940	4752340	Which one is that, the Lego game?
4752340	4753340	Huh?
4753340	4754340	Which, what's the third-party game?
4754340	4755340	The Lego game?
4755340	4756340	Uh, no.
4756340	4757660	They're showing Ghost Recon online.
4757660	4758660	Oh.
4758660	4759660	Wow, okay.
4759660	4763060	You know what, though, Bobby, you're wrong because those are going to be an actual game
4763060	4766020	because that's what Wii Sports and Wii Play ended up being.
4766020	4769700	It's all those tech demos and they've had, hey, you know what, we're going to be innovative.
4769700	4773260	We're going to slap that shit together, kind of duct tape it a little bit, and throw it
4773260	4777500	out with a controller because people are suckers and they want free controllers.
4777500	4781940	But Bobby, that should make Bobby happy because that Chase Me is basically Pac-Man Versus.
4781940	4783940	Pac-Man Versus is awesome.
4783940	4784940	Right.
4784940	4788300	And what I'm saying is, like, people are, you know, when people look at these stuff
4788300	4790900	they're going to be like, wow, they're going to make me pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.
4790900	4793020	No, they're not going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.
4793020	4798740	They're going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me, Battle Me, and all that other stuff.
4798740	4802220	But I mean, they were very adamant with me when I talked to people that actually worked
4802220	4805060	at Nintendo and weren't just hired for the Wii.
4805060	4808340	As you can tell, by the way, because the people that worked at Nintendo have QR codes of their
4808340	4812300	knees on their badge that you can scan.
4812300	4817420	But they actually were very adamant saying these are conceptual demos.
4817420	4819460	These are not final products.
4819460	4825420	These are to get your mind working and trying to tell you this is the type of stuff you
4825420	4826420	can do.
4826420	4833820	Yes, we may see, you know, the shield pose game and Chase Me and Battle Me in some kind
4833820	4837620	of compilation, but not as stand-alone games.
4837620	4841820	The only stand-alone games, like, they had the Mario game running there and then, you
4841820	4844180	know, goes online running.
4844180	4847260	But the rest were tech demos.
4847260	4850740	Just so you guys know, the feedback on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very, 1 being not at
4850740	4853540	all, how interested are you in the Wii U?
4853540	4856460	I see lots of, it's just all over the board.
4856460	4858920	There's some 9s, but there's also some 1s.
4858920	4860520	There's a 0 from Joe Videa.
4860520	4863900	A lot of 5s and 4s, and then like a 6.
4863900	4865380	So there's a universal meh.
4865380	4867380	It's all over.
4867380	4871580	And that's because, it's because it's all conceptual right now.
4871580	4874180	People aren't seeing final products right now.
4874180	4877340	And you know, even the hardware isn't finalized.
4877340	4881540	And they didn't really emphasize enough that, you know, this is a new console.
4881540	4885460	You could actually walk away from there, and even I thought, this is just a new controller
4885460	4887240	for my Wii.
4887240	4893620	And you know, right now you're playing some of the games with Wii Remote, it's got a Wii
4893620	4901420	sensor bar underneath each TV, even though there's a sensor bar in the Wii Wii controller.
4901420	4905740	But essentially, I eat this out of them.
4905740	4912180	The console is called the Wii U, and they haven't named the controller yet.
4912180	4914220	I want to name it Bob.
4914220	4922380	I just wonder this, are we ready for the era of the game controller to cost $100 plus?
4922380	4927620	I don't think it will, because that touch screen is not, it's a cheap, it's the DS touch
4927620	4928620	screen.
4928620	4929620	I called it on Sunday's show in Summerguard.
4929620	4931020	But it's a 6 and a half.
4931020	4932020	It's larger.
4932020	4935460	Well, I don't think, I still think, it's a lot larger.
4935460	4936460	I don't know.
4936460	4937460	7980.
4937460	4940420	Yeah, but it's larger, but it's not multi-touch.
4940420	4941420	So that's one big thing.
4941420	4942420	Bobby went, go ahead.
4942420	4947660	Yeah, go ahead, finish your thought, sorry.
4947660	4951020	So it didn't seem to be like, I couldn't do any multi-touch stuff.
4951020	4954980	Maybe their current demos don't have multi-touch, but yeah, I mean, it's just a larger version
4954980	4957940	of the DSi screen.
4957940	4963140	Bobby, were there any demos that were using more than one of those controllers on the
4963140	4964140	same system?
4964140	4966520	Because that was something I noticed at the conference, none of the games were using more
4966520	4968000	than one of those controllers.
4968000	4970980	Everything was supplemented with additional Wiimotes.
4970980	4975060	I didn't get a good look at Battle.me.
4975060	4976980	That was the only one that might have.
4976980	4981940	But everything else, it was either, you know, it was a one-player experience, or, you know,
4981940	4987340	it was one person using that, and then four Wiimotes.
4987340	4991520	I think I watched a video of Battle.me on Nintendo's website, and I want to say the
4991520	4995820	person flying the spaceship was using the controller, and everybody else was on a Wiimote,
4995820	4999780	so no, if the videos are to be the definitive answer.
4999780	5001180	I thought that was interesting.
5001180	5006540	Like, maybe the price of the controller really isn't going to be such an issue, because they
5006540	5009860	aren't really going to have you, or want you to have more than one.
5009860	5012060	Maybe the games aren't really going to need more than one.
5012060	5013060	That's baloney.
5013060	5015860	That sounds to me like just the whole thing with the GBA connector.
5015860	5016860	Oh yeah.
5016860	5017860	Oh yeah.
5017860	5018860	It's the same theory.
5018860	5021460	Why don't they just make a connector for the DS?
5021460	5024060	Here's the thing.
5024060	5028980	The controller is not creating any graphics, and I think that might be why.
5028980	5029980	They're actually...
5029980	5036420	The graphics on the controller is being created by the Wii Wii Wii Wii, and it's being sent
5036420	5042780	wirelessly with very little lag to the controller.
5042780	5048540	That makes sense, and that's some technology you can see right now in the PS3 and the PSP.
5048540	5050940	You can log into your PS3 on your PSP.
5050940	5055860	It's a very little advertised feature, but you can fire up your PSP and log into your
5055860	5059740	PS3 and see the image on your PSP, and it does work.
5059740	5065100	And remember back when Kasarai was first showing Ridge Racer, the original concept was that
5065100	5067220	that PSP was supposed to be your rear view mirror.
5067220	5072500	We never saw that really fully realized, but the idea was out there a while ago.
5072500	5077420	If no one minds actually if I go back to an old point, because she just made the point
5077420	5078420	to me.
5078420	5079420	Sure.
5079420	5086180	But Sierra has said that as a person who bought around eight different versions of Final Fantasy
5086180	5087900	VII, I don't care if it's the same game.
5087900	5090700	Talk about back to the Animal Crossing thing.
5090700	5094540	The fans will buy it if they like it, so that's why it says the same thing.
5094540	5098300	Then the fans can't complain when they say, oh, well, it's just the same game, they didn't
5098300	5099300	do anything.
5099300	5101300	Four, not seven.
5101300	5108580	Bobby, you're in a unique position that none of us, and probably most of our chatters and
5108580	5112040	even listeners are in tonight, where you're the only one that's actually held one of these
5112040	5113140	Wii U's.
5113140	5118180	So coming out of there, how are you, because I know you said at the end of the press conference
5118180	5121980	you were feeling a little meh, but coming out of the demo, are you thinking you're going
5121980	5128160	to buy a Wii U, or are you kind of like, I need to see more next year?
5128160	5133340	I want to hand Nintendo my wallet, and they say here, take it.
5133340	5137340	And what was it about it that just made you go, I'm sold?
5137340	5143980	Well, I can actually contextualize a lot more, and I can see where they're going with it
5143980	5149220	and a lot of the neat stuff that they're doing, and the neat gameplay that they're doing with
5149220	5151900	that, and what they can do.
5151900	5155860	I can kind of see where they're going with it, which a lot of people usually can't.
5155860	5158740	When they first announced the DS, everybody was like, why would I want a touch screen
5158740	5160620	on my game?
5160620	5166260	And now iPhone games are really popular.
5166260	5169580	And I could see where that was going, and nobody else could figure out why would I want
5169580	5171740	a touch screen gaming system.
5171740	5176660	I actually saw, when I first saw the DS, here's why you'd want a touch screen gaming system.
5176660	5179700	I could actually see it, and it's true.
5179700	5183100	And a lot of people are like, oh, this is a gimmick and all that stuff.
5183100	5186700	And a lot of Nintendo's innovations have been copied by everybody else, and they were called
5186700	5191220	gimmicks at first, like Rumble was a gimmick.
5191220	5197300	And now we have touch screens on everything, motion controls are on everything.
5197300	5201700	I think that Nintendo is going to innovate in this space, and you're going to see in
5201700	5206700	a couple years other companies copied them, and it's not the first time they've done this
5206700	5210060	because they've already done the GameCube, Game Boy Advance thing.
5210060	5213500	So they've already got a track record of some of the stuff they already know.
5213500	5216780	Very, very interesting response.
5216780	5221700	I know this is all speculation at this point, no one knows, but any idea when this thing
5221700	5222820	might hit shelves?
5222820	5226660	Does it seem like, no, we're going to have another E3 where we see the Smash Brothers
5226660	5231100	and we see the games, and we're going to talk Holiday 2012, or is this going to be a 3DS
5231100	5234500	style launch where you think maybe it's coming March?
5234500	5235580	Holiday 2012.
5235580	5237580	It'll be Holiday 2012.
5237580	5243020	Just from being in retail, Nintendo always saves the machines for Christmas.
5243020	5244020	But not the 3DS?
5244020	5245740	No, no, not the portables.
5245740	5251500	No, this is coming from one of those guys that has the QR code on his badge.
5251500	5252500	Oh, okay.
5252500	5253500	So that's the official word, then.
5253500	5258420	Bobby, what did you think about the analog 6 being above the actual D-pad and the face
5258420	5259420	buttons?
5259420	5261460	That's a little backwards compared to the controllers now.
5261460	5262460	3DS is that way.
5262460	5263460	It felt natural.
5263460	5264460	All right.
5264460	5265460	All right.
5265460	5271540	Because of where the triggers are, there's the triggers and then the LB and the RB, but
5271540	5276020	because of where they are, that is the exact position your thumb would really want to be
5276020	5278420	if you wanted to use the dual analog sticks.
5278420	5283120	Bobby, if I'm not mistaken, you were kind of in this wee line yourself and doing this
5283120	5285460	whole thing, kind of going in there by yourself.
5285460	5289500	Now, I know when I'm in a big environment like that by myself, because I did E3 myself
5289500	5293340	one year, or at least one of the days, and one of the things that I couldn't help but
5293340	5296460	do was listen to other people around me and do a little bit of people watching.
5296460	5298100	Yes, I was being a little nosy.
5298100	5301980	Were you doing any of that maybe in the Nintendo booth and kind of picking up some of the buzz
5301980	5305860	from people around you?
5305860	5310500	Not really, because everybody around me spoke different languages.
5310500	5311500	Touche.
5311500	5312500	All right.
5312500	5317380	But, I mean, people were generally, they had been in that line for so long, they weren't
5317380	5325020	really enthusiastic except for in the shield pose game where you kind of have to be, but
5325020	5328100	you know, some people, it seemed like they got a decent response.
5328100	5332060	I think the hate that's on the internet is not on the show floor.
5332060	5333060	Okay.
5333060	5334780	A lot of questions from chat.
5334780	5336780	We have a couple, chat.ownerswannatraday.com.
5336780	5340660	Frisbee U says, Bobby, does the controller feel too big?
5340660	5344300	And Jenai asks, how heavy is the controller?
5344300	5350040	The controller is actually lighter, or it's about the same as my iPad.
5350040	5354780	If I don't have a cover on it, it feels about the same weight as my iPad does.
5354780	5355780	Okay.
5355780	5356780	And how did it feel?
5356780	5362420	And as for, it felt natural, like, I mean, you think it's big, but then you hold it and,
5362420	5367460	you know, I mean, I had normal-sized hands, and it felt fine, because you're not reaching
5367460	5368940	all the way down to the bottom.
5368940	5371900	Like, all the buttons are easily accessible.
5371900	5376500	You know, it's, you know, yeah, it's also, I mean, it's also a prototype controller as
5376500	5377500	well.
5377500	5381380	It could change at the end, and it was also, like, tied down, like, four different ways.
5381380	5382380	You couldn't take it.
5382380	5386260	But that probably added the weight as well.
5386260	5387900	But no, it felt natural.
5387900	5390620	It felt, it was lighter than I expected.
5390620	5395660	D.R. Froyev, I don't even think you would know the answer to this, but maybe some buzz.
5395660	5398140	What is the battery life like on that Wii U controller?
5398140	5402780	We didn't hear anything about, like, is it batteries, is it charge, how does it work?
5402780	5403780	Nothing on that.
5403780	5406300	Well, it was wired when I played it.
5406300	5411060	Ah, so maybe it's feeding, well, no, because they showed in the other concept videos, it's
5411060	5412060	going to be wireless.
5412060	5417420	We talked about beaming the image wirelessly, but it's too early now, it's early on.
5417420	5420460	The proto pictures I've seen online look like they have a charge port on them.
5420460	5422980	I want to know what this parrot has to do with anything.
5422980	5423980	Bobby?
5423980	5425980	It's just in a demo.
5425980	5426980	What?
5426980	5429980	I'm sorry, you were going to say something, we were cutting you off.
5429980	5436220	No, it was just, it's wired here, it's a prototype, I mean, things change, you know, I mean, the
5436220	5440780	3DS didn't really change all that much, but I remember, like, the original DS was different
5440780	5445100	when it came out, so this is the prototype thing, it could change its layout, I don't
5445100	5448700	even think they know what the tech specs are going to be in the final product.
5448700	5453700	Alright, let's move on from Nintendo a little bit, Bobby, because I know, but what?
5453700	5454900	I gotta say one thing.
5454900	5456660	Alright, yes please, Logie.
5456660	5459660	I gotta say, cycling sounds awesome!
5459660	5460660	What?
5460660	5464700	Didn't you ever see, didn't you see that part where they're doing the FaceTime thing?
5464700	5465700	Let's go cycling!
5465700	5466700	Cycling sounds awesome!
5466700	5470060	Actually, I do have one question about the controller itself.
5470060	5474020	How is it ergonomically?
5474020	5480140	Like I said, when I held it, my fingers went to all the right places, and it, like, on
5480140	5484460	the back, which you don't get to see all that much, there is actual grooves for you to hold
5484460	5494740	with your three fingers that aren't playing with the triggers, and it felt, it felt good,
5494740	5499940	I mean, it was like, I picked it up, and my hands were in the right place, it didn't hurt,
5499940	5506180	or anything, they've got it ergonomically sound for at least my size hands.
5506180	5509220	That's what I was wondering about, because it was actually, people were talking about
5509220	5513500	the original Xbox controller, about it being massive and huge and too big for everybody,
5513500	5516540	and I was like, well I wonder if this thing, and then I looked at it, and from the front,
5516540	5520660	it doesn't look like it's very ergonomically comfortable.
5520660	5524900	But again, on the back, it's got grooves on the back that, well, for you to hold onto
5524900	5526700	and for your fingers to naturally curve around.
5526700	5529940	Well, see, I was thinking the same logic, though, with the Saturn dual analog controller
5529940	5532260	on the front, it doesn't look like it would be very comfortable, but it's one of the most
5532260	5533660	comfortable controllers there are.
5533660	5534660	Yeah.
5534660	5537540	So, yeah, I was wondering if it was along the same lines.
5537540	5538540	Yeah.
5538540	5543420	Okay, so for real now, moving on from Nintendo, because Bobby wants to go to some parties,
5543420	5549020	so we gotta let him go soon, but Bobby, any other observations from the show floor today?
5549020	5552940	Was your whole day Wii U, or did you get to see some other stuff?
5552940	5557660	I had an appointment with EA Sports, so I got to play the pre-alpha build of the new
5557660	5564500	SSX, and I can see that people who like SSX are really gonna like this.
5564500	5570180	They've talked about how they've got this snow avalanche system that is dynamic, like
5570180	5576880	it's not split second or anything that has these predetermined catastrophic events.
5576880	5584380	They actually say that they take the stability of the area, how stable it is, to see if that
5584380	5589580	actually affects more snow or stops the snow, and that's one of the modes where you're trying
5589580	5593980	to survive, not die, you're trying to get down this mountain without getting crushed
5593980	5594980	by snow.
5594980	5597660	It's very uplifting.
5597660	5606060	But they did basically Google Earth, it was kind of funny, they licensed with NASA topography
5606060	5611220	data of the entire world, and they said it's nice to have friends in high places, that
5611220	5618260	was their pun, and they had all the major mountain ranges, and you can pick those mountains
5618260	5623060	to go down, and it's the actual mountains from the actual NASA topography data, and
5623060	5625180	those are the mountains that you go down.
5625180	5629820	And they've done some things with it, like one of the mountains that's on the China border,
5629820	5632900	they decided they were gonna put pieces of the Great Wall of China in there that you
5632900	5636780	could grind off of and stuff, though it's not completely realistic.
5636780	5640380	But it's still, it's a lot more than they've done in the past.
5640380	5646140	But it worked well, I mean, it's not a final build by any means, there was some lag in
5646140	5647780	it, but I mean, that's because it's a pre-alpha build.
5647780	5648780	Interesting.
5648780	5653260	So basically, I saw that, they showed me some stuff about HEPA, which I'm not a huge Docker
5653260	5658620	fan, but it was kind of neat, some of the stuff they did, so I saw that, and then I
5658620	5664580	walked through Microsoft's booth to see what was kind of in there, and I'm going to go
5664580	5670780	play that Disneyland Connect game, because I know where I'm going Friday.
5670780	5674700	And Friday is a research trip.
5674700	5678420	Friday is a research trip.
5678420	5682860	But apparently in the demo, like I guess in the briefing, because I didn't see the briefing
5682860	5689940	I was in the air, but apparently I guess it cuts off at the end of the Peter Pan ride?
5689940	5690940	In the presser?
5690940	5694740	I think so, yeah, I just thought it was a time thing, yeah.
5694740	5695740	Yeah.
5695740	5698980	Well, it cuts off, apparently you do actually fight Captain Hook.
5698980	5701340	Now they showed that a little bit.
5701340	5702340	Interesting.
5702340	5705020	Maybe it was in a video or something, alright.
5705020	5706020	What else?
5706020	5711060	There was that, and then I walked by and I immediately thought of ROG, because there
5711060	5717980	were these four chicks wearing black dresses up on a stage, doing the time warp.
5717980	5718980	From the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
5718980	5720420	And I just had to get pictures.
5720420	5723820	And so this means they're doing a Rocky Horror Picture Show video game?
5723820	5724820	Yay!
5724820	5725820	Yes!
5725820	5728820	Yes, it is called Glee Karaoke Revolution 2.
5728820	5729820	Ugh.
5729820	5730820	No.
5730820	5736100	You've mentioned the four-letter G word.
5736100	5737100	Therefore I must go in-
5737100	5738100	I even took video for you.
5738100	5740100	Oh, wait, here we go, here we go.
5740100	5747860	You mentioned the four-letter G word, now I must go throw up.
5747860	5752620	Well, yes, and I did get the picture, thank you Bobby.
5752620	5757700	Did you get some hands on time with anything else?
5757700	5758700	Not really.
5758700	5763220	I mean, I did, I stopped by, I have a friend who works at Double Fine, and I walked by
5763220	5769220	and played Trenched, which is their Xbox Live arcade game, which is a third-person mech
5769220	5775900	tower defense game, where you're fighting waves and waves of enemies, and you can drop
5775900	5779580	turrets and different things like a tower defense game, but then you're also in this
5779580	5782780	mech shooting at them, and running around and stuff.
5782780	5787780	It was two-player offline because I was playing with the person standing next to me on his
5787780	5789780	console.
5789780	5796660	Unfortunately, this demo, they dropped you at a mission that's like in the last third
5796660	5801020	of the game, so you've already gone through the tutorial by this point and all that stuff,
5801020	5806100	and it was a little confusing key because I haven't really done much with the game,
5806100	5809380	but I can see people liking it.
5809380	5814200	It's not over the top like you'd expect from Kim Schafer, though.
5814200	5816360	So what's on deck for you tomorrow?
5816360	5817360	What are your plans?
5817360	5820580	I know we mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'm sure you want to talk about your Twitter
5820580	5821580	project.
5821580	5826640	Right, I have two appointments tomorrow, and other than that, I'm letting people direct
5826640	5828980	me.
5828980	5833060	My two appointments, just so people kind of know, at one o'clock, I'm going to visit a
5833060	5836620	Georgia company, because being in Georgia, I actually have contacts there.
5836620	5842420	I'm going to go to CCP Games, where they just announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3
5842420	5847420	exclusive, and they're actually going to show the connectivity between Dust 514 on the PlayStation
5847420	5850900	3 and Eve Online, the Excel spreadsheet simulator on the PC.
5850900	5857980	I'm very curious about that, because we miss that with so much coming out of Sony.
5857980	5862540	But yeah, I'm very interested in this whole, how does this game impact the MMO of Eve Online?
5862540	5863860	Very interested.
5863860	5868020	Yeah, and I am too, because I have played Eve a little bit, so I actually understand
5868020	5870580	the universe and stuff, so I'm going to go in there and see them.
5870580	5874340	And then at four o'clock, I do have a Bethesda appointment, where I'm going to get to see
5874340	5877540	the demo of Skyrim that everybody else has seen already.
5877540	5879300	Yeah, I guess it was on TV.
5879300	5882820	I think we saw a portion of what will be a longer demo for you.
5882820	5887100	I heard it's a 30-minute demo behind the doors, so very curious about that.
5887100	5891120	So good, those are two games we can definitely talk more about tomorrow.
5891120	5894900	And so if folks want to follow you on Twitter?
5894900	5897020	Bobby Blackwolf.
5897020	5900520	And tomorrow also, I'm going to be trying to hit Atlas, so if you have any specific
5900520	5904540	questions about Catherine or any of other Atlas games, I'm probably going to hit them
5904540	5907080	after the CCP appointment, because they're next door.
5907080	5910700	And our Chibi Wolf picture?
5910700	5913900	I'm going to go try to find Natsume and get your Chibi Wolf picture and everything.
5913900	5914900	Yay!
5914900	5917900	Need to go play Scenes Row 3.
5917900	5918900	I need my cowl.
5918900	5922940	Let me, actually, the one thing, not to load you up with assignments, Bobby, but there
5922940	5927040	is a couple, maybe you already know the answers to a couple of these, but there's two things
5927040	5931460	that are kind of missing right now, where I'm like, what happened to...
5931460	5936060	One of them is Grand Theft Auto V. Everybody was convinced Grand Theft Auto V was debuting
5936060	5938360	at E3, and we have heard nothing.
5938360	5939360	It's gone.
5939360	5941020	It's not there, right?
5941020	5943520	I have not seen it.
5943520	5947700	And then the other big question mark is, what the hell's Activision doing?
5947700	5950940	Yeah, they've got a booth.
5950940	5954440	I'll go stop by them, but I think they're doing this little game that's called Modern
5954440	5955440	Warfare 3.
5955440	5956440	Oh, yeah.
5956440	5957440	All right.
5957440	5958440	They're fine.
5958440	5959440	Don't know if you've heard of it.
5959440	5963840	Well, but still, when Activision is a huge company like EA and EA, I could name easily
5963840	5967080	like 10 games EA we know they're doing.
5967080	5969800	Activision's got maybe a couple, you know.
5969800	5970800	I'd like to know.
5970800	5971800	No, they have more than that.
5971800	5973200	Yeah, but where's the bungee game?
5973200	5976240	Where's, you know, I just thought there'd be more coming out from Activision.
5976240	5977440	Maybe because of lack of press conference.
5977440	5979680	I don't know.
5979680	5980680	Any music games?
5980680	5981680	Yeah, they've scaled back.
5981680	5982680	Yeah.
5982680	5983680	Mm.
5983680	5984680	Very interesting.
5984680	5990640	Yeah, it's Modern Warfare 3 for them, X-Men Destiny, Spider-Man, uh, where are they?
5990640	5991640	Spyro.
5991640	5994920	Well, the Activision, if I'm not mistaken, was awesome.
5994920	5997920	Spyro, cha-ching, Skylanders is what that's called.
5997920	6004120	It's basically, hey, guess what, we're gonna charge you $70 for the starter kit, and then
6004120	6008880	if you want your individual, you know, collect them all figurines that you can use for playable
6008880	6012000	characters in the game, those are each gonna cost you $8.
6012000	6016800	If I'm not mistaken, wasn't Activision also at one time the company that said, we're just
6016800	6018280	not doing E3 anymore?
6018280	6019280	Yeah, exactly.
6019280	6020280	Yeah.
6020280	6026400	And their big title now is so big that they're just like, we don't need E3, really.
6026400	6029480	You know, if they're gonna do a show, we'll make an appearance, but we don't want to spend
6029480	6030480	the money or the time.
6030480	6035160	Well, then I hope Battlefield 3, you know, blows the shit out of them, because that game
6035160	6037440	looks nice.
6037440	6040400	Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.
6040400	6041400	Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.
6041400	6044320	Yeah, I just watched, like, a mission, there was like a tank mission or whatever that they're
6044320	6045720	showing with Battlefield 3.
6045720	6046880	It's just amazing.
6046880	6049040	I mean, Call of Duty, it's pretty action-packed.
6049040	6051000	Ultra-realistic-looking wargame!
6051000	6052000	Wow!
6052000	6053000	Another one!
6053000	6056040	But it looks way better, though.
6056040	6061600	They all look great, but I mean, it's just like, awesome!
6061600	6063000	We gotta let Bobby go find some...
6063000	6064000	I have...
6064000	6067480	No, no, hang on, I gotta respond to something in here in chat.
6067480	6072000	Kaijuto says, the reason why there isn't a GTA 5 is because Agent is coming up with the
6072000	6073000	GTA 5.
6073000	6078680	Now, I can't remember who exactly I heard this from, but it was from somebody I trust.
6078680	6084600	Apparently, they heard somebody ask, I think it was Jack Trenton, is Agent still a PS3
6084600	6085600	exclusive?
6085600	6089880	And his response was, you'll have to ask Rockstar about that.
6089880	6092560	Hmm, interesting.
6092560	6097640	Bobby, we gotta let you go find some good beer in LA.
6097640	6102360	But before we do, I can't imagine anyone that listens to Orange Lounge Radio doesn't already
6102360	6106140	know about your show, but just in case there's like the one person that doesn't, tell us
6106140	6108760	a little bit about your show.
6108760	6110760	I'm the opening band.
6110760	6111760	Stop.
6111760	6116760	And I am on at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, right before Orange Lounge Radio.
6116760	6121000	It's me talking for about 30 minutes, and then I take calls and everybody tells me I'm
6121000	6126200	wrong for the next 20 minutes, and then I goof off with Rob and Dark Talker for 10 minutes,
6126200	6127200	and that's my show.
6127200	6128200	That is my entertainment.
6128200	6133200	And it's at All Games Radio, it's where it's live, or bobbyblackwolf.com is the website
6133200	6138480	where I've almost, you know, I'm not as old as they all are, but I'm coming upon the ears
6138480	6139480	next month.
6139480	6140920	That's still very impressive.
6140920	6141920	Very impressive.
6141920	6142920	You're still a big boy.
6142920	6145200	You can sit at the big kids' table.
6145200	6149200	All right, well, Bobby, we'll be talking to you again tomorrow and have a lot of fun at
6149200	6153360	E3 tomorrow and just play as many games as you can, all right?
6153360	6154360	I will.
6154360	6156080	I mean, Thursday also is wide open.
6156080	6160480	I don't have any appointments on that day, so, you know, if I don't get through it tomorrow,
6160480	6164680	I want to get through it Thursday, and I want to say, because some people don't believe
6164680	6168480	me when I say this, is they started asking me, go ask Microsoft if they're going to charge
6168480	6169480	for Skype.
6169480	6171680	I'm like, no, I can't, because I don't have that kind of access.
6171680	6172680	Right, right.
6172680	6173680	Exactly.
6173680	6180240	Try to keep your questions to games that maybe aren't triple-A titles or from triple-A developers.
6180240	6183840	I want to find, you know, like this here, Scribblenauts.
6183840	6187720	Scribblenauts I had never heard of until I saw it in the back corner of WB's booth a
6187720	6189760	couple years ago, and it blew me away.
6189760	6194080	Katamari Damacy I really hadn't heard of until Namco showed it off a couple of years ago
6194080	6200960	at E3, or many years ago at E3 now, so I'm looking for those games, and if you hear something
6200960	6205960	that maybe you want to hear more about that GameSpot and iGn at the big sites aren't going
6205960	6208880	to cover, those are the games I want to find.
6208880	6211800	I'm not going to be able to tap Peter Molyneux about Fable the 30.
6211800	6216560	I'm not going to be able to ask Sony about, you know, if they're going to be doing this
6216560	6219120	or that with the Vita, because they're not going to talk to me.
6219120	6222960	What the smaller does, they will answer my question, and those are the people I want
6222960	6223960	to talk to.
6223960	6227480	Alright internet, you have your homework assignment, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf, and I just
6227480	6231440	want to clarify, even though Bobby will still be at the show Thursday, we will not be having
6231440	6233120	an E3 special Thursday.
6233120	6238280	Anything Bobby does on Thursday, he will be doing on his own show this upcoming Sunday
6238280	6242560	when he broadcasts live, and we will not be here live on Sunday.
6242560	6244160	It's all weird, this programming thing.
6244160	6248240	I'm just going to have to like draw a grid, but follow our websites and stay tuned for
6248240	6250000	all the information in our twitters.
6250000	6252360	That's how you can stay on top of the world.
6252360	6256720	And on my show Sunday night, I will actually talk about the actual demos of the Wii Wii
6256720	6261240	Wii Wii that I played, and how each of them felt and played and all that stuff.
6261240	6262800	Alright, sounds good.
6262800	6267760	Alright, well Bobby, we're going to let you go so we can get to some other calls, and
6267760	6270800	I got to call Shane too, who's also there waiting to talk to us.
6270800	6272560	So take care, buddy.
6272560	6277120	Yeah, no, hey, I get to go watch nerds riding a mechanical bull now, it's going to be great.
6277120	6279360	Awesome, have fun.
6279360	6280360	Thank you.
6280360	6281360	Bye.
6281360	6283480	The one and only Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.
6283480	6286820	Thanks so much to him for joining us for over an hour on that call.
6286820	6288920	One hour, nine minutes, he's been joining us here.
6288920	6289920	That's a long phone call.
6289920	6290920	That's a long phone call.
6290920	6291920	That's a lot of minutes.
6291920	6292920	Poor Bobby.
6292920	6297880	Alright, before we get to Shane and Miklotov, bringing him on the show, talking, he was
6297880	6303040	also at Nintendo's press event, so we're going to hear about Wii U all over again, yay Logie.
6303040	6305640	Have you guys been experiencing E3 from home?
6305640	6306640	What have you guys been doing?
6306640	6311880	You know, we're not there this year, which is kind of different, especially me being
6311880	6312880	there last year.
6312880	6316760	I'm kind of sad I'm not there this year, but it's been interesting kind of doing E3 from
6316760	6317760	home.
6317760	6321440	I like that some of the stuff I can go right on and download right away, like ConnectFunLabs,
6321440	6326120	I was all over that for like 10 minutes, and Logie, you were a big fan of my Sailor Moon
6326120	6327120	videos, right?
6327120	6328120	That's pretty funny.
6328120	6335680	Well, I've been going on Twitter and seeing random, this is bullshit, Wii U what?
6335680	6338120	So my Twitter's been a source of hilarity.
6338120	6339760	Dan, what about you?
6339760	6347000	I've been streaming all the press conferences, and I've been going to the game sites, and
6347000	6352560	just experiencing it as much as you can from the comfort of your computer chair.
6352560	6354040	That's right.
6354040	6355920	And where the food is reasonable.
6355920	6356920	We should be there.
6356920	6357920	I know.
6357920	6358920	We failed.
6358920	6359920	Next year.
6359920	6360920	Next year.
6360920	6364040	Alright, let me ask this question too, Logie, I know you've had some hands on with this,
6364040	6367680	some of the stuff that's been released during E3, we've had a few, not just ConnectLabs
6367680	6372040	was, it's out today, but there was also ExciteBike3D came out.
6372040	6375400	Did you get a chance to grab the ExciteBike3D on 3DS?
6375400	6382720	I did, I checked it out, I'm glad that it wasn't just them kind of offsetting each individual
6382720	6389480	sprite layer, but, I mean, it still wasn't that great, it was like watching ExciteBike
6389480	6394320	on a really tiny screen, because when you do it in 3D, it's just, it's really tiny.
6394320	6395760	Do you have that here with you?
6395760	6396760	I don't.
6396760	6397760	Dammit.
6397760	6398760	Do you have it, Rob?
6398760	6400640	Yes, I do, actually.
6400640	6401640	Give to Daddy.
6401640	6405880	We'll see what you think of this, let me, I have Zelda Link's Awakening up right now,
6405880	6411240	which by the way, I love that you can actually frame it inside a little Game Boy, and it
6411240	6415960	does this 3D effect, where it's just like the image is indented just a little bit, like
6415960	6418880	you're playing on an actual Game Boy, because remember how the screen was behind the glass
6418880	6419880	a little bit?
6419880	6420880	Yeah.
6420880	6421880	Yeah, it's kind of funny.
6421880	6424280	If anything's gonna sell me a 3DS, it's crap like that, but they need to drop the price
6424280	6425280	like 50 bucks.
6425280	6426280	Let's get one right now.
6426280	6427520	It's just too expensive.
6427520	6431400	They probably will before too long, so here you go, I'm gonna give that to Dan, he can
6431400	6434060	check that out right now.
6434060	6439160	I do like how when you zoom, use the 3D slider on it, how it zooms it back into like the
6439160	6446520	original game, which is kind of neat, but I mean, beyond that gimmick, I just can't
6446520	6448400	get too excited about it, you know what I mean?
6448400	6454520	It's just, I don't know, it's as exciting as Excitebike is, I guess.
6454520	6462080	Alright, well we are going to give Miek Latov a call and ask some more questions about Nintendo.
6462080	6466080	We're gonna hear another perspective, and I don't know if, I don't think he got hands
6466080	6473680	on with Wii U today, but he was there at the Nintendo presser, and Dan's like, this is
6473680	6475200	widescreen, what's going on?
6475200	6480440	Alright, we're gonna give Miek Latov a call, I just punched in the digits, one ringy dingy,
6480440	6486960	two ringy dings, live radio, special presentation here on Ustream, we'll be back next Sunday.
6486960	6488920	Hi, Miek Latov, how you doing?
6488920	6489920	Good.
6489920	6496040	Hey, it's Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, of course, with DarkSakura, Loki, and Dan all here, and
6496040	6499240	we've been talking, of course, about E3, you're there in Los Angeles.
6499240	6504240	We've already kind of covered the press conferences, let me give you, let me get some quick reaction
6504240	6505240	from you.
6505240	6507600	You didn't go to them, but you know, you're a gamer too, obviously.
6507600	6512200	Microsoft and Sony, what did you think of their press conferences?
6512200	6515880	Microsoft bored me to tears.
6515880	6516880	Why is that?
6516880	6522400	Because they didn't have anything interesting, they were all, here's the Kinect that we've
6522400	6527760	been pushing for a year, and we're trying to keep it relevant, but here's some titles
6527760	6528760	for it.
6528760	6536600	And by the way, here's Gears of War with probably a drunk or high iced tea, who would be funny.
6536600	6540120	That's why he was angry, he wasn't drunk yet, and it was 11 AM.
6540120	6543400	There you go.
6543400	6548480	And really, they had me with Van Central, and that was it, nothing else was interesting
6548480	6549480	to me.
6549480	6550480	And then Sony?
6550480	6554760	Sony, I actually really liked.
6554760	6557040	I liked their monitor.
6557040	6562480	I didn't see it yet in action, but I liked the idea of two people looking at it and seeing
6562480	6566440	different things, and it's cheap.
6566440	6574880	I liked the idea of the Vita, I liked Uncharted 3, talking about Pico and Shadow of the Cloth,
6574880	6576600	this just often makes me happy.
6576600	6580160	So overall, they did really well in my eyes.
6580160	6584640	Now let's move to Nintendo, because you were there, you were at the press conference today, correct?
6584640	6585640	Yeah.
6585640	6587120	And how was it for you?
6587120	6590560	Now we've already kind of recapped, obviously, what was shown, but how was it for you kind
6590560	6592280	of being there?
6592280	6593920	I really liked it.
6593920	6597320	I'd like to go again.
6597320	6602960	It was also, while I liked it, I thought it was cool, like the orchestra, and that was
6602960	6605920	neat, and a golden remote was cool.
6605920	6611440	I was also kind of dull, and it went by really fast.
6611440	6612800	So it was almost like a blink and you missed it.
6612800	6613800	How were your seats?
6613800	6614800	Were you way up in the nosebleeds?
6614800	6615800	Oh, they were really good.
6615800	6619800	No, no, I was seven rows from the front.
6619800	6620800	Nice.
6620800	6621800	Good for you.
6621800	6625800	So you could probably see that little Wii U mote, or whatever they're going to call
6625800	6630320	it, in their hands when they were showing that off, huh?
6630320	6632040	I don't remember them showing it off in person.
6632040	6633040	Oh yeah, that's right.
6633040	6634040	Bobby even said that.
6634040	6635040	They didn't bring it out.
6635040	6636200	It was only on the videos.
6636200	6637200	That's right.
6637200	6638200	Well, whatever.
6638200	6639200	Well, what did you think?
6639200	6640200	What was your impressions of Wii U?
6640200	6644200	I know you haven't done hands-on, or did you do hands-on today, or no?
6644200	6650520	No, I went there first thing this morning, and of course all the visitors were in line
6650520	6651520	first.
6651520	6654160	That's what they do.
6654160	6659960	And it looked like it was a three-and-a-half-hour wait from where I was at, so I said, do it,
6659960	6661240	and I'm just going to do it tomorrow.
6661240	6664200	I believe Bobby waited four hours, but it moved a little.
6664200	6668560	He got in line after they said it was closed, and they told him flat out he might not see
6668560	6670600	it, but he did get to see it finally by four.
6670600	6672960	But I think he was in that line for four hours today.
6672960	6678040	Yeah, that's why I just wanted to go and look at other things today, because I knew that
6678040	6681840	tomorrow and the next day would be mostly Vita and Wii U.
6681840	6683440	Well, I want to get to those other things.
6683440	6685240	Oh, is there big lines for Vita, too?
6685240	6686240	Is that all behind the scenes?
6686240	6687240	Oh, yeah.
6687240	6688240	Oh, wow.
6688240	6689240	Okay.
6689240	6690240	Okay, interesting.
6690240	6692920	It's kind of like how Sony did the move last year.
6692920	6697080	Quickly though about Nintendo, you did get some hands-on with some of the 3DS stuff,
6697080	6698080	right?
6698080	6699080	Oh, yeah.
6699080	6703840	So what they talked about today for the 3DS, I got to play.
6703840	6704840	Oh, wow.
6704840	6706800	So that was pretty cool.
6706800	6711960	I like that they had their titles at the press conference, and I'm like, oh, yeah, and everything
6711960	6714040	we're talking about, they'll play it now.
6714040	6716400	Wait, so Kid Icarus was playable, too?
6716400	6717400	Yeah.
6717400	6719080	Oh, my God, I love Kid Icarus.
6719080	6720080	Wow.
6720080	6721760	Tell us a little bit about how that demo played.
6721760	6722760	Okay.
6722760	6725400	So there were two, well, three demos.
6725400	6728080	I think two of the three so far.
6728080	6735480	The first demo is a aerial mission and a ground mission combined into one.
6735480	6741000	So with the aerial mission, it's pretty much, if you played Sin and Finish Me, you've got
6741000	6748760	your little target that you control with the stylus, and then the spherical pad is how
6748760	6755880	you strafe and move up and down, and your firing is all based out of the left button
6755880	6759400	at the top bell button.
6759400	6766800	And before you actually do the mission, you actually had, I think, around nine options
6766800	6769200	for what you wanted because of your weapon.
6769200	6770200	Hmm.
6770200	6771200	So that was pretty neat.
6771200	6775860	I went with Pan Blast because I thought that was cool.
6775860	6783600	So when you're playing, if you target an enemy with a target, I don't know how to pronounce
6783600	6789760	it, it'll lock onto them, kind of.
6789760	6795000	If you hold down the L button, it'll shoot a rapid succession of shots.
6795000	6800700	If you just target them, though, and just single press it, you will deliver like a fully
6800700	6804480	charged blast that can actually take out several enemies in that area.
6804480	6805480	Hmm.
6805480	6811400	So, was that, I'm sorry, did you say the other one was the multiplayer demo?
6811400	6813920	Oh, there were two other ones.
6813920	6817920	There was a multiplayer demo, I did not get to do that.
6817920	6822520	I don't know why, I don't think I wanted to hang around at that point.
6822520	6828240	But the other one they had was AR cards, which actually, if you did the demonstration with
6828240	6829240	them, you got a pack.
6829240	6835080	So I have a pack of Kid Icarus AR cards, once the game comes out, they'll be able to use.
6835080	6842400	But all it really is, is just putting characters on, you know, through the AR, on the card,
6842400	6844000	and then they can battle each other.
6844000	6847240	It was that thing that some were joking like, hey, didn't we see this already when it was
6847240	6848720	called the Eye of Judgment?
6848720	6853880	Yes, that's all it is, but that's pretty much all their AR cards are.
6853880	6860040	Interesting that Nintendo just slaps Kid Icarus on it, and now people are going crazy about
6860040	6861040	it.
6861040	6862040	Isn't that funny how that works, Loki?
6862040	6863040	Yeah.
6863040	6865320	Is there a bet still on if a million copies of that game sell?
6865320	6867320	No, there is no bet.
6867320	6868320	It's done.
6868320	6870320	Just get over it.
6870320	6871320	Alright, alright.
6871320	6873320	What else did you play on DS?
6873320	6874320	3DS.
6874320	6878040	I played Luigi's Mansion 2.
6878040	6882960	It played like Luigi's Mansion, there was some big shocker there.
6882960	6888480	The one thing that I did not like is that, I know it's early in development, but the
6888480	6893440	frame rate chugs, even when you weren't doing much of anything.
6893440	6897160	Okay well hopefully they get that ironed out, I mean yeah, that's an early development thing
6897160	6901240	I'm sure, but they'll have to fix that.
6901240	6904520	Mario was cool.
6904520	6910760	It played like Mario Galaxy on the stages that didn't have the 3D worlds where you're
6910760	6917960	running around the entire planet upside down and stuff like that.
6917960	6922160	Nothing much really different there, you've got your raccoon suit back, but it looks like
6922160	6926640	the Tanooki suit, but it has the raccoon suit powers, so it's kind of weird.
6926640	6927640	Interesting.
6927640	6929640	Let's see, Mario Kart.
6929640	6931640	Mario Kart was fantastic.
6931640	6936680	60 frames a second from what I was told.
6936680	6937680	Even in 3D?
6937680	6939640	It works hard.
6939640	6940760	Even in 3D?
6940760	6941760	Even in 3D it does 60 frames a second?
6941760	6942760	Yeah.
6942760	6943760	Wow.
6943760	6944760	Oh yeah, yeah.
6944760	6945760	Who would play it in 2D?
6945760	6947480	Losers would play it in 2D.
6947480	6951600	Well I'm thinking of Dead or Alive Dimensions where they were saying, oh it'll do 60 frames
6951600	6955920	in 2D in 3D in 3D, like it was kind of split, so I was wondering if they were going to do
6955920	6956920	it.
6956920	6957920	Yeah, same with Street Fighter.
6957920	6958920	Huh, okay.
6958920	6965120	Yeah, but no, this was 60 frames greedy, it worked hard, which was amazing because Mario
6965120	6974040	Kart has not been hard in years, the paint lighting mechanic, when you had the jumps,
6974040	6980480	that was interesting because you either had to slow down in the air to collect coins,
6980480	6985560	or you knocked the ground as fast as you could to continue racing, so it was a weird trade-off.
6985560	6986560	Interesting.
6986560	6994600	The sub propeller, when you're underwater, whatever, that was stupid, it did nothing
6994600	6995600	for me.
6995600	6996600	And Star Fox?
6996600	7003080	Star Fox, I don't know if I had a single player, I played multiplayer though, and it felt a
7003080	7009080	lot like the multiplayer that was from the DS game, which I kind of liked, just really
7009080	7010080	nice looking.
7010080	7016320	What was cool though is that out of our four people battle, I totally killed everybody
7016320	7022400	in one, and the little, not really a Nintendo rep that was hired for this event, she was
7022400	7026320	complaining because I killed her first.
7026320	7029000	Were you aiming for her because you can see her little picture or whatever?
7029000	7030000	Yes.
7030000	7031000	Is it just a static picture?
7031000	7035600	There's a girl, clearly you have to make her feel inferior.
7035600	7036600	It's a changing picture?
7036600	7040120	Does it get reactions like when you get blown up, like I'm thinking of that Burnout game?
7040120	7041120	Oh, how funny.
7041120	7048340	No, yeah, well, it's not a changing picture, it's a stream of you, so you can see what
7048340	7052400	they're looking at, like if they're going to look up in the upper corner or something
7052400	7058420	or if they make a weird face randomly, it's seriously refreshing but fairly slow.
7058420	7061600	No picking your nose and playing Star Fox then?
7061600	7065520	You could, but it'd be hard because of the way you have to hold the system, you know,
7065520	7066520	the system.
7066520	7070360	All right, so that's cool, so it sounds like you got your hands on at least a lot of the
7070360	7071360	3DS titles today.
7071360	7075080	What was your favorite out of the bunch?
7075080	7082640	Probably a tie between Mario Kart and Kid Icarus, because I forgot to say Kid Icarus,
7082640	7084820	beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
7084820	7091520	The water in that game, as Nintendo's known to do, just was amazing, it blew me away.
7091520	7096360	One more 3DS question, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Nintendo unloaded onto the eShop
7096360	7100420	today trailers for Animal Crossing and Paper Mario as well.
7100420	7103240	Were those games anywhere to be seen?
7103240	7108240	Not that I saw, because I really wanted to play at least Animal Crossing.
7108240	7114000	I did download the trailer though when I got back to the hotel room for Animal Crossing,
7114000	7117800	and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it or not, but it's got some really interesting
7117800	7118800	features.
7118800	7119800	Oh, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.
7119800	7120800	What's that?
7120800	7121800	It looks what?
7121800	7126080	I said it's got some really cool new features.
7126080	7127080	I'm not sure if you guys...
7127080	7129360	Yeah, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.
7129360	7131360	Sitting on benches and swimming?
7131360	7132360	Awesome.
7132360	7133360	Yeah.
7133360	7136160	That's crazy.
7136160	7137960	Was your mind blown by swimming?
7137960	7140960	I was like, oh my god, I can sit down!
7140960	7144360	Wait, Mikolatov, did Animal Crossing have colored balloons?
7144360	7147960	No, no, it wasn't that cool.
7147960	7148960	All right.
7148960	7152400	Okay, then what else did you do at the show today?
7152400	7155480	So, you didn't stand in line for the Vita all day like Bobby had to.
7155480	7156720	What did you get your hands on today?
7156720	7165160	Well, I also wanted to be thrown that I played Zelda as well on the 3DS, and it was fan-freaking-tastic.
7165160	7170360	That was a close call for my tie for best 3DS game I played.
7170360	7171360	What does that...
7171360	7178080	I mean, is it just the 3D to what many consider a classic video game that did it for you?
7178080	7181200	Or did it feel new?
7181200	7183280	What was it that made it so great?
7183280	7185760	Or could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?
7185760	7187680	Sorry, what did you say?
7187680	7190080	Could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?
7190080	7193000	What made it so great?
7193000	7198100	I'm not sure I could tell I was playing a 13-year-old game.
7198100	7204600	I will say that the graphics are definitely much nicer.
7204600	7207600	The frame rate is crazy nice.
7207600	7209600	The 3D effects, I didn't really care for.
7209600	7211920	It didn't really do anything for me.
7211920	7220920	I did like people switching to the slingshot or the hookshot would allow you to move the
7220920	7224700	system around instead of using the directional pad to find your target.
7224700	7225700	That was neat.
7225700	7226700	All right.
7226700	7229400	Well, what else did you get to play at the show today?
7229400	7230400	Let's see.
7230400	7236360	I personally walked around, which is kind of a waste of a day.
7236360	7241280	I played the new Silent Hill game, both in 3D and in 2D.
7241280	7242280	Interesting.
7242280	7244280	What'd you think?
7244280	7247200	Crap is what I think.
7247200	7253240	It was terrible in 3D and it was terrible in 2D, so this is definitely a pass for me.
7253240	7255200	I'm not even interested.
7255200	7256200	Why was it terrible?
7256200	7257200	What did it play like?
7257200	7259400	Was it more like the Wii Silent Hill, which I don't see anymore?
7259400	7260720	Was it more like Alan Wake?
7260720	7261720	Was it Alan Wake?
7261720	7262720	What was it?
7262720	7268380	I wish it was like Alan Wake or even Shattered Memories.
7268380	7280960	It was like a generic survival horror that ran really choppy and was boring and not scary.
7280960	7285960	At least in every other demo that I've played at E3 for a Silent Hill game, something has
7285960	7288320	been kind of freaky about it.
7288320	7289320	Not this one.
7289320	7291520	It was just boring.
7291520	7294320	It's not Silent Hill if it's not freaky.
7294320	7295720	Exactly.
7295720	7298680	And it was just dull.
7298680	7302400	Like oh, there was an ending that jumped out and I think was supposed to scare me, but
7302400	7306880	this more annoyed me because they aren't scary.
7306880	7309920	Speaking of scary, did you see the Tomb Raider stuff?
7309920	7311800	I don't know if it's playable on the show floor or whatever.
7311800	7315400	I found that that trailer seemed to be pretty, I mean, I don't know, we've had some differing
7315400	7321120	opinions in here, but I compared it to The Descent, which I found to be a scary-ass movie.
7321120	7324880	The only thing I ever saw for Tomb Raider wasn't on the floor, it was during the Microsoft
7324880	7327240	Next conference.
7327240	7332800	So I was over in Corey Enix's booth for a bit today and I didn't see it anywhere, but
7332800	7336120	I was also playing the entire demo for Final Fantasy XIII-2.
7336120	7339560	Ooh, what'd you think of that?
7339560	7345360	I actually really like XIII despite what other people think, so I like this one a lot.
7345360	7354640	They added a few interesting features like a, what's that called, the real-time segments
7354640	7361640	like God of War and Heavy Rain tabs, which was, you know, it's a little out of place,
7361640	7363140	but it was still neat.
7363140	7369840	They definitely tried to give players a little more freedom and faith with some options that
7369840	7375880	were like, you gotta take to attack this guy or go try to weaken him first by using this
7375880	7376880	device.
7376880	7381520	I hear if you went to attack him, you died, and you'd have to reset the whole bit of the
7381520	7382520	demo over again.
7382520	7385920	So I thought that was neat.
7385920	7386920	But no dress sphear.
7386920	7387920	No dress sphears.
7387920	7389920	Do they have a release for that?
7389920	7394160	I definitely don't know who the main character is that I was playing as.
7394160	7397680	Do they have a, I think it's supposed to be Lightning Sister, do they have a release for
7397680	7398680	XIII-2 yet?
7398680	7400240	Loki, have we heard one?
7400240	7401240	No.
7401240	7402240	No?
7402240	7403240	No.
7403240	7404240	No.
7404240	7405240	Wow.
7405240	7406240	Interesting.
7406240	7407240	Interesting comment in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com.
7407240	7408240	Jenai says, Silent Hills Konami Sonic now.
7408240	7413800	And Randi Yu says, wouldn't go that far, Sonic is laughably exhausted.
7413800	7418080	Frisbee Yu jumps in, speaking of Sonic, was Sega at E3?
7418080	7419200	Of course Sega was at E3.
7419200	7427160	I went over there quite a bit, looking at my darndest for PSA-2, but it wasn't there.
7427160	7428160	Oh, I was just gonna ask.
7428160	7429160	It might be somewhere.
7429160	7434880	Surely you had to see if there was a Phantasy Star or online too, oh bummer they didn't
7434880	7435880	bring that.
7435880	7440800	Yeah, but there was a lot of Sonic stuff for their new Sonic game, and it actually didn't
7440800	7441800	look that bad.
7441800	7443800	I didn't get to play it though yet.
7443800	7444800	Hmm.
7444800	7447720	Alright, you'll have to let us know when you do finally get your hands on it.
7447720	7448720	What else?
7448720	7454040	There was this really neat Kinect game by Konami.
7454040	7458520	It was called Lead Me's, I believe.
7458520	7463840	It's both Kinect, and I believe it's a download title they said, but it plays a little bit
7463840	7464840	like Lemmings.
7464840	7471440	So you stand in front of the Kinect sensor and you become this like wire frame character
7471440	7472560	pretty much.
7472560	7476320	And you have these little adorable things that fall down and you have to get them to
7476320	7481080	safety by using your limbs as bridges, stuff like that.
7481080	7482080	Interesting.
7482080	7489040	Okay, so like you use your body to build the path to get these guys safe, basically?
7489040	7490040	Yes.
7490040	7491040	Interesting.
7491040	7496000	Any other, I know you're a big fan of music games too, any music games that you saw besides
7496000	7497320	Dance Central 2?
7497320	7505600	No, I saw DDR, but it's laughable nowadays, so it's not even worth talking about.
7505600	7511120	Aww, but I kinda wanted to know how laughable it was.
7511120	7515400	It had four licenses, I believe, and the rest were not in the originals.
7515400	7523400	And what I watched looked like the character models looked like DDR PC quality, but not
7523400	7524400	as awesome.
7524400	7528400	Because there was no Mr. Spanky or anything like that, they were just like really poorly
7528400	7529960	done character models.
7529960	7531960	Nobody loves Mr. Spanky.
7531960	7534080	What was that?
7534080	7535080	Forget it.
7535080	7536080	Oh, okay.
7536080	7542000	I did not hear you, because I'm hearing me talk every time I talk, so...
7542000	7545000	D'Artesia says, no Dance Masters 2?
7545000	7547720	No Dance Masters 2.
7547720	7553640	I do know the only thing that's behind closed doors at Konami, because I still have my hookup,
7553640	7558360	is Pro Evolution Soccer, so everything else that's on the floor is all they're showing.
7558360	7559360	Interesting.
7559360	7561080	And it's pretty sad also.
7561080	7568160	Like, this E3 has been kind of let down in terms of what's being shown, despite having
7568160	7570840	two new consoles.
7570840	7575440	What about Dance Central 2, didn't you say you had some hands-on time with that?
7575440	7582480	Yeah, I played Dance Central 2, it was fantastic, but it was just Dance Central with new characters
7582480	7583880	and new moves.
7583880	7585480	Is Harmonic showing anything else at their booth?
7585480	7588200	Aren't they supposed to be unveiling a new game?
7588200	7590240	Oh, I didn't see that at a Harmonic booth.
7590240	7592400	I hadn't seen a Harmonic booth at all.
7592400	7593400	That was at Microsoft.
7593400	7594400	Interesting.
7594400	7597640	So it must be kind of a behind closed doors thing, or in a conference room.
7597640	7598640	Interesting.
7598640	7599640	Yeah, yeah.
7599640	7600640	All right.
7600640	7605600	Well, anything else that you had some hands-on time with you want to share with us tonight?
7605600	7607600	I'm wrecking my brain.
7607600	7617360	No, I want to play Nintendo a whole lot, but I saw a lot of neat games that were briefly
7617360	7621320	mentioned at the end of the press, or just via a title.
7621320	7628040	So I saw Risen Heaven, I saw the new Kirby game, of course I saw Legend of Zelda Skyward
7628040	7632200	Sword, which looks amazing now, I'm really excited for it.
7632200	7635560	What's your plan for tomorrow?
7635560	7641360	I'm hoping a coin later to decide if I'm standing in line for Vita or Wii U.
7641360	7647280	Personally, I'm leaning more towards Vita, because I don't really think I care much about
7647280	7648880	the Wii U at this point.
7648880	7649880	Ouch.
7649880	7652440	All right, yeah, we need someone to go play the Vita, and I don't know if Bobby will get
7652440	7654240	around to it tomorrow, so I think you should do that.
7654240	7655240	Do the Vita?
7655240	7656240	Yep.
7656240	7657240	Okay.
7657240	7658240	I'll try that one.
7658240	7659240	All right.
7659240	7661720	Well, anything else you want to share before we let you go so we can get to some other
7661720	7666080	callers from our chat room at 1877 Dean Waller?
7666080	7667080	The first thing...
7667080	7669600	Okay, this will be cool to some of those people out there.
7669600	7672320	Let's start with the lamer one for a second.
7672320	7673320	Okay.
7673320	7678120	I was going down Hollywood Boulevard yesterday, because that's where my place I'm staying
7678120	7686360	at is, and if people follow reality TV at all, or gay porn, I fully ran into Dustin
7686360	7689120	Tito from either Real World or Flat Pad.
7689120	7691240	That was pretty funny.
7691240	7694040	The one with the sordid past, apparently, yes.
7694040	7695040	Yes.
7695040	7698360	I wanted to just go up to him and be like, hey, I've seen you naked.
7698360	7700360	That might have been awkward.
7700360	7701360	I don't know.
7701360	7702360	Yeah, just slightly.
7702360	7707440	But the actual cool thing that people may care about is right when I walked out of the
7707440	7713560	Nokia theater here today after Nintendo was done, I ran Snapchat instead of Kiriyamaoka.
7713560	7714560	That was really cool.
7714560	7715560	Oh, nice.
7715560	7717200	Did you get a picture or anything, or say hello, or just...
7717200	7721720	Yeah, I got a picture, I said hello, we shook hands.
7721720	7726960	I tweeted him actually after the fact, and he tweeted back, and by him tweeting back
7726960	7732120	at me, somehow G4 is now following my Twitter, which is a waste of their time.
7732120	7737480	It might be one of those spam Twitters, so look out, because I see a lot of those.
7737480	7738840	No, it's a real one.
7738840	7740840	I looked into it.
7740840	7741840	Weird.
7741840	7742840	Well, whatever.
7742840	7743840	All right.
7743840	7745800	Well, Mikkelshof, enjoy the rest of the show.
7745800	7749440	Get some hands on with Vita tomorrow and whatever else, and we'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?
7749440	7750440	Okay.
7750440	7751440	Sounds good.
7751440	7752440	All right.
7752440	7753440	And try to stalk more celebrities for us.
7753440	7754440	Yes.
7754440	7755440	All right.
7755440	7756440	I will do that.
7756440	7757440	Take care, buddy.
7757440	7758440	All right.
7758440	7759440	Bye.
7759440	7762040	We're running a little long tonight, but we will open it up for a few quick, quick calls
7762040	7764160	if anyone wants to call and just talk impressions.
7764160	7765160	What do you think?
7765160	7766160	Where are you at?
7766160	7771600	Are we completely off base with what we're saying about Wii U or Kinect or the Vita?
7771600	7776820	Give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7776820	7777820	That's all one word.
7777820	7782320	If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you use ECHO123 first
7782320	7783320	before you give us a call.
7783320	7784320	Again, what were your impressions?
7784320	7788240	I'm sure many of you, you know, I didn't want to just recap the news tonight with you guys
7788240	7790720	because I'm sure most of you were watching it.
7790720	7795160	Although I'm liking hearing about these hidden things like that Konami game that sounds like
7795160	7796160	Lemmings.
7796160	7799480	I want to hear about more of those types of games.
7799480	7801040	So we'll see.
7801040	7802040	All right.
7802040	7805620	Again, 1877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7805620	7807520	Quick programming note, we are live tonight.
7807520	7808700	We are live tomorrow night.
7808700	7814480	We are off Sunday because Bobby Blackwolf and some of us here at OLR are going to go
7814480	7817040	celebrate E3 broadcast by going to Disneyland.
7817040	7818040	I'm sorry.
7818040	7819680	We're doing research for Disney Connect.
7819680	7821920	We got to make sure that Disney Connect game is accurate.
7821920	7822920	Absolutely.
7822920	7825640	And we will leave no stone unturned.
7825640	7828300	And there have to be hidden cats in the game for it to be accurate.
7828300	7832200	But we will be back next Sunday on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7832200	7834760	That will be June the 19th.
7834760	7839600	Bobby Blackwolf will be here June the 12th, not here, but at allgames.com where he's usually
7839600	7842640	at June the 12th and of course on his podcast feed.
7842640	7846400	That's where you're going to hear his Thursday impressions since we will not be live Thursday
7846400	7847400	night.
7847400	7848960	So I hope everybody got the programming worked out there.
7848960	7854200	Again 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7854200	7859680	I have to point out, Sega did not announce a system.
7859680	7863080	So that's a no minus point.
7863080	7864080	You didn't get buzzed on that.
7864080	7865080	Exactly.
7865080	7869640	I think I'm the only one that has a buzz so far because Sony did indeed apologize for
7869640	7871600	what had happened.
7871600	7872600	And they showed Fable.
7872600	7875360	I think they weren't going to show Fable either.
7875360	7876360	I don't remember.
7876360	7877360	All right.
7877360	7878360	Well, apology.
7878360	7880760	It's kind of a gray area.
7880760	7882480	He said they weren't even going to mention it.
7882480	7883480	Not true.
7883480	7884480	Maybe.
7884480	7885480	Which they let off with by saying mentioning.
7885480	7886480	All right.
7886480	7887480	Let me get to the phones.
7887480	7888480	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7888480	7889480	Who's this?
7889480	7890480	Hey, it's Sturlock.
7890480	7891480	Hey, Sturlock.
7891480	7892480	How you doing, buddy?
7892480	7893480	Pretty good.
7893480	7894480	How's E3 going for you?
7894480	7895480	What are your thoughts?
7895480	7899080	It looks pretty awesome.
7899080	7901640	I really want a Vita.
7901640	7902960	Why?
7902960	7905080	Street Fighter vs Tekken.
7905080	7908480	But can't you get that on the PS3 or the 360?
7908480	7909480	Yeah, but come on, man.
7909480	7910480	It's a portable version.
7910480	7911480	That's just awesome.
7911480	7915760	What did you think about this whole announcement that Cole's in it as well?
7915760	7917800	I was like, what?
7917800	7918800	Okay.
7918800	7919800	Whatever.
7919800	7920800	It's kind of random, right?
7920800	7924760	But, I mean, you got, I mean, it's pretty common for an Abaco, though.
7924760	7929960	I mean, you've got Tekken characters and, like, urban rain, so.
7929960	7932120	I guess that's true.
7932120	7939480	They do that kind of stuff all the time, but Nintendo, I don't know, I still can't get
7939480	7941080	my head around this name.
7941080	7942960	Yeah, I know.
7942960	7946640	The name's a little weird, but remember, I mean, and I don't like the name either, to
7946640	7947640	be honest.
7947640	7950080	I think they should have just called it the Nintendo U, and we could have just all said,
7950080	7953920	oh, the U stands for Ultra or something like that, you know?
7953920	7958660	Or if they wanted to go back to, like, the old school, they could have called it the
7958660	7961420	U-Force, like that old peripheral.
7961420	7962920	That's a super Wii.
7962920	7964920	I like the Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii.
7964920	7970120	Yeah, I've been doing that all day, too, I was just like, oh my god.
7970120	7974240	So, damn it, where was I going with this?
7974240	7976880	Everybody's got an opinion on the Wii U.
7976880	7983080	What do you think of the console itself besides just the name?
7983080	7986880	Which I do think everyone will get used to eventually, by the way.
7986880	7988380	Ooh, do we have a network outage?
7988380	7989380	I think we did.
7989380	7990380	I think we had a drop.
7990380	7991380	Shit.
7991380	7995000	Did we have a drop stream?
7995000	7997520	I don't know if we're even still broadcasting at this point.
7997520	7998520	I think we are.
7998520	8003880	But we had an internet, okay, we had an internet downtime.
8003880	8007000	I think we're, oh wow, we just reconnected right away with Strelok.
8007000	8011000	Okay, yeah, we had a weird drop thing happen there, so that's weird.
8011000	8012000	But we're back.
8012000	8013000	Silly internets.
8013000	8014000	Yeah, silly internets.
8014000	8015000	Yes.
8015000	8016000	All right, well, whatever.
8016000	8018720	So, what's on your mind with the Wii U?
8018720	8025000	Well, I'd like to see more from it than just the spectrum of stuff.
8025000	8031120	The controller is kind of interesting, even though I honestly really can't use too much
8031120	8032120	of it.
8032120	8036480	But it's an interesting concept.
8036480	8043840	But really what has me excited is something from the Microsoft, it's not the only thing
8043840	8048320	that I really cared about from the Microsoft press conference, but something that kind
8048320	8061280	of touched on briefly was the whole Bing thing with Kinect, where you could tell it what
8061280	8063280	to play.
8063280	8067160	If you want to search for a game and then play it by voice, you can do that.
8067160	8068520	And that's really exciting.
8068520	8071680	Xbox, Bing, pornography.
8071680	8072680	Yes.
8072680	8073680	Awesome.
8073680	8074680	Indeed.
8074680	8083160	A lot of people are kind of on what Microsoft showed.
8083160	8085320	What did you think of the press conference overall?
8085320	8089520	Overall, the Microsoft conference, yeah, exactly, was just kind of like, really, more shooters.
8089520	8090520	Don't care.
8090520	8092080	Too many first-person shooters, huh?
8092080	8093080	Too many shooters.
8093080	8094080	It's oversaturated.
8094080	8095080	All right.
8095080	8097200	We're going to let you guys go get some other calls before we do.
8097200	8100880	Any other final thoughts for us?
8100880	8102880	I'm just one more.
8102880	8108720	I want Konami to announce the Snatcher game, but that didn't happen.
8108720	8110200	Sadly, it's probably not going to.
8110200	8111200	Don't hold your breath.
8111200	8112200	I was going to say.
8112200	8113200	All right.
8113200	8114200	All right, buddy.
8114200	8115200	We're going to let you go get some more calls, but have a good one, okay?
8115200	8116200	All right.
8116200	8117200	Thanks.
8117200	8118200	All right.
8118200	8119200	Thank you.
8119200	8120200	Thanks for putting up with the internet outage, too.
8120200	8121200	That was kind of weird.
8121200	8122200	It's just another day here at OLR.
8122200	8123200	Yeah, I've been having...
8123200	8124200	Hey, what's up, guys?
8124200	8125200	This is Kaijuto.
8125200	8126200	Hey, Kaijuto.
8126200	8127200	What's on your mind, buddy?
8127200	8133320	Yeah, that the Wii U, the controller, scares the fucking hell out of me.
8133320	8135760	Why does it scare you?
8135760	8138480	I mean, it looks like it's going to break.
8138480	8143760	I mean, all the stuff they want you to do with it doesn't seem very safe for the controller,
8143760	8148080	like putting it down on the floor, sticking it on that gun and swinging it around.
8148080	8149080	I don't know.
8149080	8151120	It just looks like a lot of kids are going to break that thing.
8151120	8154160	You know, I think you're kind of onto something here, because I can't tell you, and this is
8154160	8157760	kind of embarrassing, but I can't tell you how many headsets I've broken on my computer,
8157760	8160160	because I'll sit it down on my chair when I get up to go to the bathroom, and then I
8160160	8163120	come back, crunch, my fat ass sits on it and crunches it.
8163120	8164400	So you have to be really careful.
8164400	8165800	Like, you're going to need...
8165800	8170980	Everybody needs a coffee table to put that controller on, and that's away from the dogs
8170980	8172640	and the cats that tend to do this.
8172640	8174920	Yeah, it's like the big glass on it.
8174920	8176400	It's like, you know, it just...
8176400	8180560	To me, it feels like it's going to just break within a couple of weeks.
8180560	8181560	Let's be real.
8181560	8182660	It's not really glass.
8182660	8185040	It's that cheap, plasticky thing that the DS has used.
8185040	8187040	It's the same touchscreen from a DS, just bigger.
8187040	8188040	Oh, yeah, I did not.
8188040	8189040	Those get broken.
8189040	8190040	It looks like glass to me.
8190040	8191040	Yeah, they will get...
8191040	8193040	It'll still get broken, but yeah.
8193040	8194040	So...
8194040	8199400	Well, let's say that controller is invincible.
8199400	8201400	What is your thoughts about Wii U otherwise?
8201400	8206560	As far as, like, being innovative, I think they're going somewhere with it.
8206560	8210880	I'm going to agree with Bobby Blackwell if I saw a lot of potential with what they were
8210880	8211880	showing that you could do with it.
8211880	8217160	I mean, it's still not something that I want to run out and get right away until I see
8217160	8223080	something that I really like, but you know, I do appreciate them for trying to bring some
8223080	8228000	innovation to the game where even though they're recycling the same old games, you know, just
8228000	8238080	putting Mario on everything, but other than that, they are innovative with their shit.
8238080	8240440	At what point would Nintendo be charging too much?
8240440	8242480	I get a lot of feedback, by the way, just to let you know.
8242480	8243720	I'm like hearing myself talking about it.
8243720	8245720	Yeah, and we have an Echo thing going on, but just...
8245720	8249520	Well, do you have the Ustream running, because you've got to pause it.
8249520	8256640	The other thing is, at what price do you think the Wii U becomes too expensive right now?
8256640	8257640	$399.
8257640	8258640	$399.
8258640	8262360	So, if it's $398, you might be there.
8262360	8263360	No, no.
8263360	8266040	No, I get it at $298.
8266040	8267040	Alright.
8267040	8268040	$299, $298.
8268040	8271880	Alright, well, Kajuda, we're going to let you go to see if we can get another call,
8271880	8273160	but thanks so much for the call.
8273160	8274160	Take care, buddy.
8274160	8275160	Alright.
8275160	8276160	Good night.
8276160	8277160	Good night.
8277160	8278160	Later.
8278160	8279160	877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8279160	8285200	Give us a call, and as we start to wrap up here while we wait for one more call, where
8285200	8286200	are you guys at?
8286200	8290680	You know, a lot of people feel the need to rank Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, but let
8290680	8293200	me kind of leave it here with this.
8293200	8297360	Out of what we've talked about tonight, what are you most excited about?
8297360	8300880	What are you most interested in hearing more about?
8300880	8301880	Dark Sakura?
8301880	8302880	Animal Crossing.
8302880	8303880	No, really.
8303880	8312880	To be honest, I'm still actually kind of meh about a bunch of it, really.
8312880	8319400	There were things I had hoped to see that didn't pop out, and really, it was a lot
8319400	8323040	more of what I expected, although I do really like that new controller.
8323040	8327760	I'm more excited about that controller for the Wii U, even though the name is, you know,
8327760	8328760	stupid.
8328760	8331760	Alright, we'll get to the other feedback in studio here in a minute, but we do have
8331760	8333280	another call coming in, so let's get to that.
8333280	8334280	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8334280	8335280	Who's this?
8335280	8337280	Hey, this is Blender from Napo.
8337280	8338280	What's going on?
8338280	8339280	Blender!
8339280	8340280	What's on your mind?
8340280	8341280	Nothing.
8341280	8344480	I just, I, one thing I don't know if you guys mentioned, I was like five minutes late
8344480	8351400	getting into the show, and nobody mentioned, I was really interested in the BioShock Infinite
8351400	8354440	with the move support.
8354440	8357920	You're right, we did kind of skip over that, and that is kind of a big deal, yeah.
8357920	8361960	I didn't even, I gotta be honest, I was really terrible, and I didn't even play that
8361960	8366160	far into the first BioShock game, but I was all over this look of the new game, it's
8366160	8367160	awesome.
8367160	8370040	With the whole like, air rails and stuff, that game looks sweet.
8370040	8375800	I'll finally get to wipe the cobwebs off of my move.
8375800	8378600	What did you think about Ken Levine's little kind of comment?
8378600	8384040	He had this, it was almost awkward to me a little bit, his little interlude about how
8384040	8387320	he's finally got won over by the move.
8387320	8388320	He sold out.
8388320	8389320	Yeah.
8389320	8391600	Sony said, hey guys, guys, money.
8391600	8395600	And they're like, oh, we like money, and they're like, alright, put move support in
8395600	8396600	your game.
8396600	8400000	And they're like, oh, okay, and say something good about the move for us.
8400000	8402320	Alright, I can do that, because I like money.
8402320	8406000	It was like Gabe Newell last year with the whole Valve thing, but.
8406000	8407000	Exactly.
8407000	8410640	Well, what else caught your eye, Blinder?
8410640	8416480	Well, I just, Uncharted 3, of course, I'm just a huge Uncharted fan, the multiplayer
8416480	8417480	looks fantastic.
8417480	8424680	But, other than that, well, see, I only own one system, I only own the Sony, so.
8424680	8426920	So there's not a lot for you on the other ones.
8426920	8431860	Did maybe, I have to ask it, did Microsoft or Nintendo maybe make you think twice about
8431860	8433760	picking up another one?
8433760	8438000	Not Nintendo, but Microsoft, I mean, I'm still kind of on the edge.
8438000	8445400	I mean, I'm not a fanboy, if I had the money, I would pick up another system, you know.
8445400	8454280	But it's just, mainly what I've been listening to is just for the Microsoft thing, would
8454280	8459680	be like, if they did it, they need to make a Kinect, like an L.A. Noire Kinect game.
8459680	8461560	That would tell me.
8461560	8464000	Where I can just slap the bitch if I think they're lying.
8464000	8465000	Yeah, yeah.
8465000	8466000	Pop!
8466000	8467000	All right.
8467000	8470400	Have your partner do, hey, go over there and go investigate this for me, I'm gonna go have
8470400	8471400	a beer.
8471400	8472400	All right.
8472400	8474320	Blinder, any other last thoughts for us before we let you go?
8474320	8475320	No, that's it.
8475320	8476320	All right.
8476320	8477320	Take care.
8477320	8478320	We'll see you later.
8478320	8479320	All right, you too.
8479320	8480320	All right, bye.
8480320	8481320	All right.
8481320	8482320	We are gonna go ahead and close the Skype line, guys.
8482320	8483320	I'm very sorry to those folks that didn't get through.
8483320	8486520	Don't forget, we're gonna be back tomorrow, and we'll have a little more time to take
8486520	8487520	more calls tomorrow.
8487520	8489600	So if you didn't get through tonight, don't be mad.
8489600	8492240	You can also email us mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
8492240	8495900	We will go to the mailbag tomorrow, because we won't have press conferences.
8495900	8498000	We're gonna hear about other games tomorrow.
8498000	8499000	We still haven't talked Skyrim.
8499000	8500720	We gotta talk a little bit about Skyrim.
8500720	8503360	Some of the other games, we'll probably dive into Bioshock a little more.
8503360	8506400	Whatever it is that Bobby and Shane can get their hands on, we're gonna talk a little
8506400	8510120	more about tomorrow, and your calls will really help fill in and email us tomorrow.
8510120	8511640	And Chibi Wolf.
8511640	8512640	And Chibi Wolf.
8512640	8513640	Let's hope.
8513640	8516380	For now, I wanna go around and get everybody's kind of last thought here.
8516380	8520360	And again, guys, sorry to cut it off, but we were only intending on going till nine,
8520360	8521640	and it's almost 9.30.
8521640	8525560	So I wanna try and wrap up, and everybody's being a real trooper for staying with us.
8525560	8529280	But Dan, what are you walking away from this most excited about?
8529280	8530840	The Wii U.
8530840	8531840	The Wii U.
8531840	8532840	Wii Wii Wii.
8532840	8534880	Why is that?
8534880	8537260	It could be really awesome.
8537260	8538560	Or it could fucking suck.
8538560	8539560	No, I'm just kidding.
8539560	8540560	Well, and that's exactly it.
8540560	8544800	If Nintendo comes through with the price, and they come through with the games, and
8544800	8549320	you know, some people do some great development for it, I mean, it could be really, really
8549320	8550960	smooth.
8550960	8552720	And it could do a lot of cool stuff.
8552720	8555080	Or it could be an absolute waste of technology.
8555080	8558220	And Nintendo's scary, because Nintendo does that.
8558220	8560840	Sometimes Nintendo hits something, and they just knock it out of the park.
8560840	8565400	And then sometimes Nintendo's just like, yeah, look at our great thing!
8565400	8567240	We have no fucking idea what to do with it.
8567240	8570600	I mean, the Vita is really cool.
8570600	8574260	And I mean, I kinda knew it was gonna be a really cool thing.
8574260	8579080	And when Sony came through with pricing, that wasn't, you know, ridiculous, because I swore.
8579080	8584000	I swore they were gonna say, $599 US dollars, and everybody was gonna laugh them out of
8584000	8585000	the arena.
8585000	8587600	When they said $250, and everyone was like, alright.
8587600	8594200	You know, I was like, okay, maybe Sony's learned a thing, but it's just a better PSP.
8594200	8597840	Where the Vita could be something completely new.
8597840	8600560	They didn't just say, okay, here's a new Wii controller.
8600560	8605720	They said, here's a new, different thing that no one's done before.
8605720	8608280	And that could be pretty slick.
8608280	8609280	I'm with you there.
8609280	8612660	I wanna go to chat real quick, because one of the other games that's being brought up
8612660	8615040	in chat right now that we didn't get into depth about today.
8615040	8617360	Randy Yu says, Batman, Batman, Batman.
8617360	8621240	And Blender says, did you see the Catwoman trailer, Randy Yu, which, you know, was shown
8621240	8622240	at one of the press conferences.
8622240	8627240	Now I gotta say, there were two things out of the whole three press conferences that
8627240	8631440	made me audially, audible say, wow.
8631440	8634220	I said wow twice during the press conferences.
8634220	8637080	One of them was the $499 3D monitor.
8637080	8638080	I said wow.
8638080	8641840	The other one was when they announced that Batman Arkham City was gonna be on the Wii
8641840	8642840	U.
8642840	8643840	Batman on Nintendo.
8643840	8645400	That's just, I don't know why.
8645400	8646560	It's just crazy to me.
8646560	8650780	Well, and if they don't have to make huge graphic compromises, it means that the Wii
8650780	8654400	U has at least the horsepower of the current generation of consoles.
8654400	8655400	Correct.
8655400	8656400	So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.
8656400	8658040	Uh, Loki, I know you still need to answer.
8658040	8659800	I will, uh, let me go first here.
8659800	8664600	Uh, I'm gonna say the thing I am most excited to see more about, I'm gonna be honest.
8664600	8666560	I'm gonna go kind of off the beaten path here a little bit.
8666560	8669120	Although the Wii U, yes, of course I'm gonna see more of that.
8669120	8673880	I really just feel like, I just, everything is fucking speculation till next year.
8673880	8675760	You know, it's, it's so, so early.
8675760	8679600	Now we know that most of the rumors were true and we've seen where they're going with it.
8679600	8686400	But for me, the more immediate question, I actually want to see these hardcore games
8686400	8688080	with the Kinect functionality.
8688080	8690320	I want to see how the public responds to it.
8690320	8699580	I want to see, I, when I play Kinect, I do really like it and I, I really want so much
8699580	8703920	more out of the Kinect and I'm just, I'm really curious how some of these shooters are going
8703920	8704920	to play.
8704920	8709880	I mean, I kind of even want to play the Ghost Recon game just to check it out.
8709880	8712080	That is never a game I'd be interested in otherwise.
8712080	8713080	It's so weird.
8713080	8714120	I'll save you the trouble.
8714120	8718040	The response is going to be, eh.
8718040	8720360	But maybe like two people are going to like buy it.
8720360	8724960	It's just like, that's what Twitter will say, but what will the dollars say?
8724960	8726800	That's what, that's what the dollars are going to say.
8726800	8727800	You think?
8727800	8728800	I, I, I disagree.
8728800	8732680	In my life, I've dealt with a lot of mainstream gamers.
8732680	8738000	I've worked at game stores for 10 years and I've seen those guys come into the store and
8738000	8746320	the Twitter crowd, as much as I hate to say it, is kind of the voice of the quote unquote
8746320	8747760	hardcore gamer.
8747760	8753360	The guy who cares enough to be sitting on the computer watching that press conference
8753360	8756960	and not because he's going to come on here tonight and talk about it.
8756960	8760040	You know, there's just not going to be a lot of interest.
8760040	8761040	Fair enough.
8761040	8762040	You know, it'd be sweet.
8762040	8763480	It'd be sweet if they could pull it off.
8763480	8766240	I'm the first guy to admit I have an unopened connect.
8766240	8772840	It's Jamie's and uh, if they did something sufficiently awesome, that would make me rip
8772840	8773840	into that thing.
8773840	8774840	I mean, I would love it.
8774840	8779840	I'm probably going to open it now just to try connect labs, but it's just like, wow,
8779840	8784360	I would love to see the shooter that, you know, you could stand in front of your TV
8784360	8787720	and play and not have it be a real shooter or hell, even just the light gun game.
8787720	8789280	Cause I totally missed light gun games.
8789280	8791040	Well, the Wii U is going to have a lot of this.
8791040	8792040	Yeah.
8792040	8794920	Like, you know, I was complaining about the on rail stuff and that's all I connect do.
8794920	8795920	You know what though?
8795920	8798560	Like ghost squad on the Wii is fucking awesome.
8798560	8802960	Squad is an awesome game and the Wii Zapper is a good ghost squad control.
8802960	8804520	I wanted the ghost squad rifle.
8804520	8805520	Okay.
8805520	8806520	That's a little too far.
8806520	8812880	Cause it's got the little trigger and it's got the pull thing, but I wanted the ghost
8812880	8816260	squad rifle to be the Xbox 360 rifle and it just never happened.
8816260	8820160	I like that new connect looking rifle, or not connect, the move rifle, by the way, it
8820160	8821160	was cool.
8821160	8823320	I got to say though, Dan, I'm not disagreeing with your perspective necessarily about like
8823320	8827480	who the hardcore gamers are and all that, but I got to say, I really think that with
8827480	8834640	no Wii U this year, Microsoft kind of has that Nintendo soccer mom casual market cornered
8834640	8836040	this year.
8836040	8839880	And it's, it's just going to be interesting to see what connect games rise to the top.
8839880	8845600	Will it just be dance central to number one seller this year or will that connect functionality
8845600	8847320	float a hardcore game up to the top?
8847320	8851480	Well, they need to come up with, you know, their Wii sports resort or with their Wii
8851480	8852520	fit.
8852520	8855360	That one game that just every connect owner has to have.
8855360	8856360	Dance central.
8856360	8857360	I think it's dance central.
8857360	8858600	But it's not dance central.
8858600	8863400	All the dance fans love dance central, but the common folks aren't just like, oh man,
8863400	8864400	dance central.
8864400	8867080	Because I was in a room full of common people the other day and nobody really liked dance
8867080	8868080	central.
8868080	8869080	Really?
8869080	8871920	I would say dance central, not just like music fans like us who've been following a few years,
8871920	8875120	but like rock band fans, which is a much wider audience.
8875120	8876120	All right.
8876120	8877120	Air guitar freaks.
8877120	8878120	We've got to get towards wrapping up.
8878120	8879120	Yes.
8879120	8880120	I've got to let Loki have his say.
8880120	8882120	Loki, what left you wanting more?
8882120	8884880	Saints Row 3.
8884880	8886400	Air Saints Row the Third.
8886400	8887400	It's awesome.
8887400	8891640	And god damn it, I wish they'd just announce a new Grand Theft Auto and be done with it.
8891640	8892640	No kidding.
8892640	8894280	And Half Life 2 Episode 3.
8894280	8895280	Fuck you, Valve.
8895280	8896280	Fuck you right in the ear.
8896280	8897280	We know it's coming.
8897280	8898280	I mean, come on.
8898280	8900380	Just, just, just come out and say it.
8900380	8903520	You know, that's, that's really it.
8903520	8904520	All right.
8904520	8905520	Fuck Valve.
8905520	8909840	And the fact that, you know, so what Nintendo's console can play Batman Arkham Asylum.
8909840	8910840	You know what?
8910840	8913600	The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 can also play that.
8913600	8914600	Why do I care?
8914600	8915920	A year earlier.
8915920	8921640	I, yeah, and I'm not gonna go buy, you know, a console just because they can play a game
8921640	8924280	of a console that I can already have.
8924280	8929600	I want to see what titles Nintendo's gonna have that are exclusive to this that are actually
8929600	8934040	gonna be worth my time instead of saying, hey, lookit, we got this really cool thing.
8934040	8935680	Because here's the problem.
8935680	8940840	They're hoping that the publishers are, you know, gonna be creative enough to use this
8940840	8942640	technology that they built.
8942640	8947320	Last time I checked, it never was a problem that, oh, these games aren't creative enough.
8947320	8954160	It's oh, we just don't give a crap about fleshing up this game to the point of, you know, attracting
8954160	8958480	other people other than casual gamers because, eh, casual gamers still just buy whatever
8958480	8963560	as long as it's $19.99.
8963560	8964560	Alright.
8964560	8968920	Well, um, anything you guys are hoping, well, Loki, you're not gonna be here tomorrow.
8968920	8970920	No, I'm not gonna be here.
8970920	8974400	And Dan will be here and Dark Soccer and myself.
8974400	8977880	But since you kind of have, this is your last chance to say whatever you want on the show
8977880	8981660	here about E3 till next Sunday, anything else you kind of want to get out about your thoughts
8981660	8982660	on the show?
8982660	8988280	Um, I mean, other than just like some of the stuff that's already been, there's nothing
8988280	8992320	really that's like brand new, nothing out of those conferences that was really just
8992320	8993800	caught me off guard.
8993800	8999800	You know, um, I don't know, it was just no real surprises, nothing like, oh my God, that's
8999800	9000800	so amazing.
9000800	9001800	And you could see it.
9001800	9003040	The crowds weren't into it.
9003040	9008020	There were like one or two pops when something that they were supposed to pop at came.
9008020	9013400	There were a lot of pauses where the companies expected applause and nobody was into it.
9013400	9016240	It was a very apathetic attitude.
9016240	9021480	Even the big stuff that people were supposed to be into just didn't win people over.
9021480	9026840	All right, we'll be back tomorrow to do some more E3 coverage.
9026840	9032420	Dark Soccer, myself, Dan, and you guys in our chat room and of course in LA, a big thanks
9032420	9036840	of course to Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, Miklotov are both in LA and they will be back with
9036840	9038960	more game opinions tomorrow.
9038960	9042240	But for tonight, we say goodnight.

9048080	9050360	Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
9050360	9054880	No video yet, but hopefully you stream in the future and not tomorrow either, but you
9054880	9055880	stream in the future.
9055880	9060040	We might have some more video features, kind of like we used to back in the day on OLR.
9060040	9062720	So besides that, I'm so completely unglamorous right now.
9062720	9065600	I can't be on video or it will explode.
