14022	24699	Tonight, June 7th, 2011, we kick off our live E3 coverage with press conference reactions and special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov in LA on the show floor.
31721	32302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
49898	52900	To those of you that are brand new to Orange Lounge Radio, welcome.
53480	59164	If you found us through Ustream or what have you or some of the other referrals, which we'll talk about in a little bit, welcome to our little show.
59464	75795	We are the show where every gamer has a voice and boy, here's a lot of voices about what has been talked about from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, to a lesser extent EA and Ubisoft, but there's just a lot, a lot of talk today and we're going to get right into it, but I need to introduce everybody on the panel.
76155	80400	First off, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes known as Sky, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.
80660	83023	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
83283	83583	Meaty.
83944	84344	How are you?
84665	84985	Meaty.
85125	86066	Feeling fresh and meaty?
86306	86587	Meaty.
86807	87087	All right.
87668	91772	And say hello to the one and only, and I'm so happy he can make it here tonight, Techmaster Loki.
91792	92373	Hi.
92673	97639	We were a little worried that Techmaster Loki wouldn't be here tonight because of family commitments, but here he is.
98760	99280	Screw the family.
100281	100761	Just kidding.
100941	101761	I hope Nelly's not listening.
101781	102262	No, no, no.
102422	102882	All right, good.
103182	107304	So welcome to you, and we're going to ask you about Nintendo in just a little bit.
107744	109445	Also joining us, we've got other people joining us.
109465	112566	We're going to have the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from The Bobby Blackwolf Show.
112626	117208	He usually does a show right before us on our normal live shows Sunday night.
117228	121170	Of course, we're live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
122010	124911	And more information about all of that is at our website, orangelonestradio.com.
125152	127453	Bobby Blackwolf is in L.A.
127673	127853	at E3.
128593	130534	He will be joining us momentarily to talk about it.
130754	134475	He has played the Wii U. We're going to talk all about that in a little while.
134775	136435	I want to introduce somebody else here in studio though.
137075	138216	Dan the Man is joining us.
138556	139216	Hello.
139556	140436	What a pleasant surprise.
140476	140996	How are you Dan?
141376	141836	I'm good.
142257	142637	Awesome.
143937	145637	So, E3.
146638	147458	I wish I was there.
148571	151933	We're going to get into all the press conferences and so forth.
151953	155055	Let me just start with this before I plug everything and do the usual plugs.
156135	166440	What is one word on your mind right now that just if E3 right now can just boil down to one word, what is that word right now?
167181	167461	Dan?
169362	169942	Underwhelming.
170702	171243	Underwhelming.
171423	171663	Loki?
171703	171783	Loki?
174875	176756	DarkSakura
198103	199403	We're going to get to that later in the show.
199723	202944	If you want to join our chat room, please note we do not have a Ustream chat.
203244	205265	We have a IRC chat room.
205305	208745	More information is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
208765	213246	So please, by all means, pull up a chair, sit in the chat room, and join us there.
213466	216807	And Orange Wright in the chat room will start us off tonight.
217227	221188	Kind of all one word slammed together says, third party saving first party asses.
223028	225729	I guess my runner up would be, seriously?
225749	226049	Seriously?
227205	227905	Oh, that's a good one.
228165	229746	Is it going to be all negative tonight?
229766	229946	Really?
230006	238450	Because I swear to God, all I've been reading on Twitter is just cynicism, skepticism, negativity, and I'm like, this is why everybody hates gamers.
239811	243853	Like, there's not an ounce of positivity I'm seeing on Twitter.
244593	246734	But I don't feel 100% negative.
246754	248275	Are there things that I think should be done better?
248315	248615	Sure.
249275	250315	But is it all negative?
250376	251296	I don't necessarily think so.
251598	253239	But is anything mind-blowing?
254840	255221	No.
257062	260625	Yes, but probably not from any of the big five that we're going to talk about today.
261445	262106	I'll leave it at that.
263086	263587	All right, anyhow.
264187	266949	I also want to plug us on Facebook.
266969	268470	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
268831	269171	Twitter.
269251	271092	Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
271513	273674	Bobby Blackwolf, of course, he'll be joining us in a little bit.
273714	275195	We're teaming up tonight to do the coverage.
275475	276456	He is also on Twitter.
276716	278518	Twitter.com slash Bobby Blackwolf.
278558	280119	And the reason why I plug that is that
280819	283521	Today he was pretty dominated at the Nintendo booth all day.
283581	285983	Well, he wasn't dominated at the Nintendo booth, maybe.
286303	291266	But his day was dominated by the Nintendo booth because he was at the Wii U event today.
291946	294268	But tomorrow, he will be taking your orders.
294568	296269	You will be dominating him on Twitter.
296810	300232	And he is going to be your man on the floor at twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf.
300712	301613	And if you're like, hey...
302273	306905	What freaking Konami games are there that weren't at the press conference or whatever?
306945	310814	And he'll tweet you back and say, Glee Karaoke Revolution with Rocky Horror.
311155	311616	Yay!
312239	314460	Reggie's bitch today, your bitch tomorrow.
315461	316801	So twitter.com slash Bobby Blackwolf.
317181	321643	I also want to say thank you to those of you guys that have retweeted, helped promote these special shows.
321703	327686	I know it's a little weird because we're not in our usual home, but we had to kind of think fast and this all really came together last minute.
327926	329167	So I want to thank everybody involved.
329427	334989	I want to give a special shout out to Video Game Outsiders who has a show usually live tonight at All Games.
335210	340452	They didn't end up doing one tonight because of personal reasons, but they sent a tweet that was like, go listen to OLR.
340612	344419	and I thought that was very nice of them to do and so I wanted to give them a shout out and a thank you.
345822	347946	It's going to be a night of varying opinions.
348407	351473	It's going to be fun so remember kids, play nice and be respectful.
352335	353336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
371832	379658	Halo, Halo Anniversary Edition, Halo 4, neither of which, interesting enough, had Kinect shown.
380038	384281	It was one of the only games, in fact, I think, at that whole press conference that didn't have Kinect shown.
386022	389865	Is there any excitement whatsoever about the new Halo 4 or the Halo Anniversary Edition?
390566	390766	Nope.
391286	391827	Did you hear the...
392941	395824	I'm into it, I like Halo, I'm stoked for more Halo
412981	413742	I will say this.
414422	418384	It did mess with my head not seeing the Bungie logo before the Halo trailers.
418424	418725	Did it?
419505	421286	Yeah, I was just like, oh, it's Halo.
421686	423828	Oh, yeah, there is no Bungie making Halo anymore.
424128	425068	Oh, that's kind of sad.
425309	425589	Yeah.
426429	429371	It did seem like that trailer had a very different look to it as well, huh?
429411	431412	Yeah, it just didn't have that Bungie feel.
431612	432113	Yeah, it didn't.
432133	433574	It didn't have that big orchestra.
433594	435655	That's okay, I think, you know?
435875	436555	Yeah, that's true.
436615	439237	Bungie had kind of ran their course, I guess, but...
439520	450043	I don't want to even say they ran their course, but it's just like, okay, there were the Batman movies from the 80s and 90s and stuff, and then there's the new Batman series.
451143	460326	The beginning of one was good, and the other one is also good, but it's refreshing, I guess, to have a new style of gameplay.
461471	466714	Yeah, but it's hard to deny the fact that it's Bungie's franchise.
466734	468115	Well, it was Bungie's franchise.
468135	469335	It's Microsoft's franchise now.
470196	472417	And it's weird that it won't have their stamp on it.
473058	477340	Unless the new developers are just sick copycats, which is about the best I could hope for.
478598	480400	Let me jump over to Anniversary Collection for a minute.
480600	484504	Huge speculation on the internet before that it was going to be very Kinect heavy.
484644	487567	In fact, I believe there was a domain, halokinect.com or something.
487987	497096	Now, granted, there could be more announcements between now and when the game actually comes out, but unlike most of the other stuff that Microsoft was pushing at E3, wasn't seeing Kinect in this Halo game.
497937	499698	Do you think they changed their mind?
499778	501060	Do you think this is yet to come?
501539	511945	No, it's because that would have required them to do some extra work because basically they're just upgrading the assets slightly and they're porting it over to the Reach engine.
512005	518409	So it would have required them to rebuild a portion of the engine and adjusting the physics so that it's like Halo 1.
519089	523212	But it would have required extra work for them to do that.
523732	524552	Maybe Halo 4.
524933	527334	Yeah, you can bet your ass Halo 4 will use Kinect.
528308	536474	Did you find that little footnote that came out after the press conference about that the multiplayer is all just multiplayer maps for Halo Reach?
536835	541518	It is not actually a part of the Halo Anniversary Collection or whatever, Anniversary Edition?
541538	542739	It is.
542939	544801	I had read this thing online about... No, no, no, here's how it works.
544941	545842	Yeah, that can't be right.
545922	546902	Please, please share me.
546942	549384	Okay, it's very similar to ODST.
549464	556570	Basically, you have one disc that has the single player campaign on it and, of course, the co-op for that disc.
556810	559331	Then you have also the multiplayer disc.
559611	566974	Now the whole multiplayer disc is the full Halo Reach multiplayer portion, I guess.
567454	574716	And the maps do exist on the Reach servers, but since it's also on the Reach engine, that's what's going on.
574776	580078	These maps are for Reach, but you can play against other people that also have Reach, I believe, as well.
580899	581459	Interesting.
582119	584040	Well, I guess that's kind of cool if it kind of bridges that.
584060	585960	Yeah, because ODST did the same thing they did.
585980	589441	It was Halo 3 they were playing on.
590701	592422	So it's not bad.
593662	597943	And considering the fact that it's also going to be a budget-priced game, too, it's going to be a $40 game when it comes out.
598463	601404	Just because they know they can't make a better multiplayer engine than Bungie did.
602594	610699	Let's talk Kinect for a little bit because obviously Kinect dominated a lot of Microsoft's press conference and it's taken a lot of flack on the internet because of that.
610719	625988	I noticed when I was watching Twitter over the press conference there's a lot of people hating on Microsoft right now because their conference was very Kinect heavy and it didn't seem to address the hardcore gamer which is funny because that's the battle Nintendo's been fighting for years.
626428	627609	Bullshit, I'm sorry.
627669	628770	They have the best stage.
631380	632201	And that's important.
632522	633483	Hey, it was important.
633644	640775	I mean, we're going to get into it later on, but they're not the only ones that, you know, okay, other than, you know, PlayStation, I guess.
641356	644801	They're not the only ones that really focus on their motion gaming stuff.
646764	649146	And yeah, what they showed, I think it's a little bit of everything.
649186	658735	You had some stuff for the hardcore players and you had some stuff that's like, well, this shit's on, you know, could have been on the Wii or, you know, it's very kidsy, I guess.
659456	662939	Let me ask a question of our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com again.
663259	668684	For those that are joining us for the first time because of the Ustream connection here, our normal chat room is at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
669625	670265	Answer this for me.
670345	670866	Be honest.
670946	672567	Is there a Kinect title you want to try?
673228	676190	And I want to talk about some of those Kinect titles that were announced at the show.
676330	681532	And I want to go to DarkSakura for a minute because I know you must have perked up when you heard about the Disneyland Kinect game.
682533	684534	Did you hear about the Disneyland Kinect game?
685074	685734	No, I didn't actually.
686415	689656	Yes, there's this whole... I relied on somebody to fill me in.
689976	692097	Obviously, Dan didn't fill her in on the Disneyland Kinect.
692117	692798	You didn't ask.
693718	698841	Alright, well, there's this whole Disneyland Kinect game going on where they really harped on...
699241	701402	You're going to get to be in Disneyland.
701422	706285	And they actually showed, you know, like you're going through down Main Street and so forth.
706565	712788	But then as you walk up to a ride like Peter Pan's Adventure, they had these little overacting kids on stage demonstrating it.
712868	713608	It was just mini games.
713988	715049	And you know what it made me think of?
715429	720031	I don't know if you guys remember an old 8-bit game by Capcom years and years ago called Adventures in the Magic Kingdom.
720232	720512	Yes.
720872	722213	It was an old-ass NES game.
722393	723353	It was the same thing.
723513	724554	Do you know what this game is?
724694	724894	What?
725350	726831	It's another Connect Adventures game.
727731	730092	Seriously, Connect Disneyland Adventures.
730352	731252	Connect Adventures.
731393	732273	It's all it is.
732313	736014	That's why you're flying through stuff and collecting coins or whatever.
736495	737635	Except it's in Disneyland.
737695	738055	That's all.
738075	739336	The Disney Hub looked cool.
739356	741457	The minigames looked like butt.
741517	743137	That's exactly where I'm at.
743177	743918	Exactly where I'm at.
743958	744438	No, exactly.
744718	749580	It's fine because it looks fun, but... Let me put it this way, though.
749740	753962	They seriously need to tone down the acting for the people that they have on stage.
754122	754322	It was...
754742	756303	It was to the point where it was distracting.
756343	761245	I mean, I understand you wanted to make it look fun and stuff like that, but oh my god.
761265	763866	Do you have any idea how many Red Bulls those kids drank?
764286	767087	They worked their little hearts off, and they're probably dead right now.
767548	770389	They burned out showing you how fun that game was.
770933	772133	I want to know what this horror is
791651	796696	I don't think anybody here in the room got Minecraft, quote unquote.
796916	798998	I get it, but I just don't want to play it.
799659	801020	Yeah, I think that's where I'm at.
801181	803202	I get it, and I understand why people love it.
803323	804464	That being said, it's not for me.
804764	808608	It's just I don't have that much free time in my day to play something like that.
809088	809588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
829173	830034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
851189	855974	We have some more feedback in our chatroom on the Disney game, Disneyland Adventures for the Kinetic Tiger Claw.
856295	860439	When they showed that Disneyland game, I was reminded of that Universal Studios game on the GameCube.
860499	861280	Remember that game?
862201	862461	Hmm.
862702	864864	Actually, I don't, so that doesn't bode well for this game.
864884	865585	Oh, it was bad.
865625	866045	What was it?
866065	866646	I don't even remember it.
867567	869990	Universal Studios Mini Games Back to the Future
881883	882984	was Woody Woodpecker.
883024	893288	That would be like, okay, we've got a Disneyland game coming out, but unfortunately all the Disneyland characters, like 98% of them were too expensive to license, so we got Herbie the Lovebug to be in the game.
893308	894549	So we decided to do Knott's Berry Farm.
894569	896069	That would be expensive because it's Disney.
896089	897250	That would be it.
897310	897690	That's it.
897910	899371	We couldn't get Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse.
899451	901832	Connect Knott's Berry Farm Adventures.
904577	905637	At least they'd have good chicken.
908378	915580	Savalas in the chair says, Connect Disney is for families in Nebraska who are not able to get to a Disney amusement park.
916041	918401	I see it as more like the thing to just shut the kids up.
918781	919122	No, no.
919242	923143	I'm sure that my store, Nebraska Furniture Mart, will sell plenty of those.
924757	928078	I really do hope somebody hacks the Disneyland Connect assets and makes a Grand Theft Auto style port.
928098	930599	Come on now, let the kids have something.
953373	956656	Who hasn't made Grand Theft Auto and GTA yet?
973288	974730	I hate fucking Elmo.
974810	976132	Yeah, maybe with less Elmo.
976152	980637	If it had like Cookie Monster and Big Bird in it, I'd be like, this game's going to be tight.
981198	983460	I'm going to buy a copy and I'm going to play it.
983721	986103	If Linda the Deaf Lady was teaching me how to sign.
986524	988066	Dude, Linda the Deaf Lady was hot.
991045	991666	There you go.
993608	998635	BlackWolf is in our chat room right now talking to the chatters there saying, I had Sesame Street games on my Intellivision.
998716	1001379	Word fun and Electric Company math fun.
1001499	1003222	Dude, the Electric Company game was amazing.
1004755	1008919	I want to know more about this whole live streaming TV thing they were talking about.
1008939	1010420	Was I the only one that didn't really get it?
1011141	1011541	I don't get it.
1011681	1014343	It flowed really weird in their presser for me.
1014563	1015544	They were watching Castle.
1016085	1017586	Yeah, they're watching Castle apparently.
1017726	1020369	I caught a little ad in the sidebar.
1020429	1023932	I don't know if it was just a marketing placeholder or whatever, but it said The Connect Show.
1024352	1027635	And that made me think, is Microsoft producing their own content for this too?
1027795	1028956	Or was that just a placeholder?
1029056	1030557	I think it's a placeholder, but here's the thing.
1031278	1037522	It's basically going to be content that, say, for example, I have Comcast, so it's going to be Comcast programming.
1039224	1039704	Great.
1040024	1043767	I can just turn the TV on and watch TV.
1043807	1045408	I don't need to watch TV through my 360.
1045668	1047890	Will my 360 act as a TiVo?
1047910	1049531	Because if so, I could actually kind of use that.
1049631	1053054	Well, what it's doing is, you guys know what the review is, right?
1053374	1054135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1080976	1083658	Harry Potter, and it'll show you all the games, all the CDs.
1084819	1087280	So, I mean, will it like search the internet too?
1087360	1091543	I mean, do we have a legit... No, it won't search the internet because it doesn't have a fucking web browser in it.
1091623	1097147	Will Kinect finally respond to me going, Xbox, Bing, gay porn.
1098968	1100169	It'll probably look up gay porn.
1100189	1101150	Then it'll be My Little Pony.
1102170	1104472	It'll come back with some indie gay... Yeah, it'll come back with My Little Pony.
1104492	1104972	Care Bears.
1105873	1106473	The Smurfs.
1107674	1109055	Lady Gaga on HBO.
1109075	1110015	Oh, no.
1112882	1116144	I hate the new interface.
1116984	1117625	It was weird.
1117725	1121287	It took me a minute to figure out that they were actually demoing a new interface.
1122067	1123568	I mean, I'm not stupid.
1123628	1130311	I saw that it was a new interface, but I thought it was kind of like a spinoff for the TV thing, like the Kinect thing is.
1130392	1131472	It's a little separate thing.
1131732	1134314	I didn't think I was looking at a whole new dashboard.
1135194	1137475	and I was kind of like, okay.
1138695	1141035	It looked like the crossbar a little bit, didn't it?
1141055	1147397	No, it's modeled after Windows 7 phone stuff and then also Windows 8 is supposed to be very similar to that.
1148097	1149917	Good for them to do that kind of stuff.
1149937	1153038	First off, Windows 8, that shit is optional.
1153078	1154278	It's like the fucking media center.
1154319	1156259	You don't have to use media center if you don't want to.
1157438	1161063	However, on the Xbox 360, it's not fucking optional.
1161523	1161984	I'm sorry.
1162324	1166890	Hitting the guide button again to get my fucking blades back is not fucking optional.
1167211	1169213	I want the blades.
1170415	1171176	You know what?
1171196	1171716	Here's a thought.
1171736	1173939	I know this is crazy and out there, but...
1174718	1176019	Thanks for watching!
1192366	1197647	Techness in our chatroom at chat.orange.studio.com says, I think it's great they added complete voice search.
1197707	1201488	It's pretty hard and quite pathetic that in the current dashboard it's hard to find shit.
1201768	1202109	I agree.
1202149	1202969	That's kind of my problem.
1203349	1207970	You know, Connect Fun Labs was on the thing like right after the press conference.
1208010	1209450	You had to dig to find it.
1209510	1210091	No, you didn't.
1211211	1212531	It was not on the main bar.
1212611	1213971	You had to go to the E3 coverage.
1213991	1214872	You didn't look hard enough.
1214932	1215832	Then you go to Connect.
1216192	1217854	Thanks for watching!
1239915	1240495	I thought it was.
1240876	1241476	Yeah, pretty much.
1242556	1242936	Whatever.
1243177	1243457	All right.
1244417	1245778	Moving on to some other announcements.
1246278	1248679	Some of the non-connect things at the top were actually pretty cool.
1249460	1252061	There was the Modern Warfare 3 demo that they demoed.
1252101	1256403	And, you know, I'm not into those games, but I was kind of looking at the footage going, oh, that's really pretty.
1256563	1262886	That's pretty cool if I could actually do that when I play the game as opposed to just running into walls constantly and shooting my friends.
1263046	1266988	You mean there's a Modern Army game where I can shoot things and shit explodes?
1268636	1270519	That's revolutionary and brand new!
1271580	1275064	I have to admit, I thought it was pretty cool when they were doing that whole little getaway in the raft.
1275104	1277187	I was like, it's like Super Army Cart.
1277467	1279630	They had a raft at the end of the last game.
1279870	1281412	Oh, shows you how much I play those games.
1281432	1282394	Fuck Modern Warfare.
1282674	1284376	And the truth is, I like Modern Warfare.
1284396	1284997	Uh-huh.
1286590	1290692	And then, and I love this, the Tomb Raider demo was hot.
1291012	1292733	I thought that was like my favorite thing I saw.
1292753	1303418	Tomb Raider was neat, but once again, you know, I've already, I've kind of set that franchise aside for, well actually since the first Tomb Raider, I just never got into Tomb Raider.
1303498	1304399	But it looks cool.
1304479	1311702	Yeah, the thing about this new Tomb Raider is that it didn't look at all like the old ones, because it didn't look like a reboot at all.
1311842	1313223	No, it looks like Uncharted.
1315549	1322651	Which, maybe that's why Microsoft wanted to show it in their conference And then they have Adventure Sense, which is like saying, hey, you can't figure out the puzzle?
1323171	1341236	We'll do it for you I'm gonna need that It's Tomb Raider for idiots Well, what I loved about it though is that there were scenes very reminiscent of that movie The Descent Which is like one of the few movies ever to legit scare the shit out of me So I can kind of see where the survival horror thing is coming from for Tomb Raider Because some of that stuff did look kind of scary
1341915	1346858	Tomb Raider needs something, and if this rejuvenates the franchise, great.
1347458	1351941	But just the same, it's like, it's Uncharted.
1352081	1354662	How many times have they tried to reboot Tomb Raider?
1355263	1358845	So many times, and it's failed every time, so hopefully this time it's a little different.
1359125	1362687	Congratulations Xbox, you get Uncharted, it's Tomb Raider.
1362727	1367590	Well, but Tomb Raider is not exclusive to the 360 either, so I thought it was weird that they demoed it as Microsoft Prime.
1367610	1369171	Yeah, but PS3 people can just play Uncharted.
1369191	1369451	Yeah.
1370333	1371414	Yeah, that's why they didn't demo it.
1371434	1374076	They don't want to show Uncharted and then, you know, Tomb Raider.
1374116	1375577	Hey, this looks kind of similar.
1376137	1376738	Like, oh, wait a minute.
1376818	1379620	Uncharted is awesome and Tomb Raider is trying again.
1380020	1385424	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, the Tomb Raider demo got kind of creepy with all the moaning and panting from Lara Croft.
1385505	1386766	Yeah.
1387206	1390328	GameGuru says, Tomb Raider looks too much like a survival horror game.
1391869	1392170	Let's see.
1392250	1395512	Randy U says, dude stabbing Lara and closing her eyes?
1395552	1396073	What the fuck?
1396713	1400794	Janai in our chatroom says, Uncharted is so bro, bro, bro.
1401914	1402874	Uncharted is pretty cool.
1404135	1405655	I did watch that little bit of the demo.
1406135	1406955	Of the Uncharted demo?
1407035	1407375	Yeah.
1407575	1407815	Yeah.
1407875	1411396	When Dan was watching it, it was, let's drown for a while.
1411676	1412796	Let's press A repeatedly.
1413336	1414397	Let's not drown for a while.
1414477	1415217	That's Uncharted.
1415897	1417397	So I was like, yeah, I won't play it.
1417417	1418117	Let's shoot people.
1418278	1419458	And then QuickTime events.
1420098	1420378	Awesome.
1421506	1426087	And then, of course, Connect Fun Labs was shown, and I wanted to see the look on Loki's face when that was being demoed.
1426107	1426868	That was awesome.
1426888	1427808	Well, here's the thing, okay?
1427848	1429328	All this stuff got spoiled.
1429668	1434490	Like, right before the press conference, oh, look, our E3 page got leaked out.
1434650	1439531	So, you know, all the big, you know, announcements, they were already out there.
1439771	1442812	And Connect Fun Labs, that shit leaked a while ago, but...
1444212	1471454	and here's what you know Connect Fun Labs is it's hey look here's all the tech stuff that we said we could do before and couldn't do now you can you know remember the whole hey I can scan my skateboard in there and you know play the first thing that they show did you notice even the lady said finally she's like and now you can scan in your skateboard finally so you know she's been catching shit about that for a year like the first thing they show someone scanning a skateboard in and then jumping on a virtual skateboard and playing and now they're like oh you can do it
1472202	1477465	Well, and the thing about Connect Me too and the whole Fun Labs is that it is not changing your avatar.
1477705	1481688	It's not like how the 3DS will make a me out of taking a picture of you.
1482168	1485370	It is just like a temporary thing to do fashion magazine poses.
1486450	1492794	But then what the fuck is the whole thing where, oh, you don't have to fumble through menus anymore to pick your avatar.
1492834	1494095	Then you're full of shit.
1494115	1494675	I'm not trying to be rude.
1494695	1495176	It's a fucking lie.
1495196	1495516	Yeah, screw it.
1495556	1497277	I'm not hooking up our Connect after all.
1498117	1523925	you cannot make the avatar out of it you know what I did what I wanted to test I wore my Pikachu shirt to see if it would take a picture of the Pikachu shirt and like actually show Pikachu if it would just be a yellow shirt and it came through as a Pikachu shirt I mean it was a horrible scan of it but it was definitely Pikachu and I was thinking well obviously this won't be the main avatar because they can't show all that copyrighted stuff that people scan in somebody will wear a dick on their shirt I haven't tried it yet but that's gotta be wrong
1524625	1526726	I am not... See if you can figure it out.
1526766	1528427	Chat, is anyone playing Kinect Fun Labs?
1528447	1528887	Tell me if you are.
1528947	1529808	I do not believe you.
1529828	1530728	Let's hook up our Kinect.
1530908	1531789	Save your avatar.
1532249	1532989	It's your Kinect.
1533029	1534750	Someone was supposed to lend me Dance Masters.
1537432	1537712	Alright.
1537892	1538592	Dance Central 2.
1540173	1540794	Yeah, Dance Central.
1540814	1541674	What did you think of Dance Central 2?
1542194	1543095	It looks like Dance Central 1.
1544987	1552673	I have to admit, I'm a big fan of Dance Central, but I didn't see, besides, obviously, Durr, the two-player thing, I didn't see what was new about it.
1552693	1555916	Here's what's new about it, and I only know this because I saw the actual feature list.
1556176	1564842	What they did is they improved the break-it-down mode where you can actually repeat individual moves or practice individual moves.
1565043	1566023	It needed to be retooled.
1566043	1571988	You can also repeat whole sections of that stuff.
1573329	1574130	There's also...
1575250	1576912	I'm trying to think what else there was in there.
1577432	1582176	The two-player at the same time, they also have the ability where you can get rid of the freestyle stuff.
1582636	1590902	Say you don't want to do that where you flail about randomly during the song, you can take that out or you can change the way it looks.
1592063	1592823	Some of that stuff.
1592864	1595626	And then, of course, the new music that they're going to have in there.
1595926	1601410	Yeah, I don't think they did a whole lot with Dance Central 2, and honestly, they probably could have just left it alone.
1601850	1604212	Well, it's also one of those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, why fix it?
1604673	1606134	How many dance games are on the Wii?
1606954	1608594	Or, I'm sorry, the Kinect.
1608654	1617158	The Kinect, there's Dance Masters, Just Dance was announced, will be coming, and there's that Dance Paradise, is that what it is?
1617278	1622620	There's Dance Masters, Dance Central 2, Just Dance 3, Dance Paradise.
1622740	1624680	Available right now.
1624780	1627922	Dance Paradise, Dance Masters, and Dance Central.
1627942	1628502	So it's three?
1628762	1632283	I like how they're like, it's the number one selling dance game on the Kinect.
1632423	1633884	And Michael Jackson, The Experience.
1634444	1635484	I guess maybe that's four.
1635985	1639206	Well, because it is the number one selling one by a mile and with kind of good reason.
1639226	1641406	Yeah, because it's the only good one.
1641606	1642407	But here's the thing, though.
1642447	1649029	Just Dance, though, I mean, it's good on the Wii and stuff because of the limitations of that, but when you...
1650069	1654595	Kind of bring that in with Dance Central.
1654776	1656258	I don't know if it's going to be able to hold its own.
1656458	1659382	People will buy it because they're like, oh hey, Just Dance, it's popular.
1659963	1664709	But I think Dance Central does a better job though.
1664729	1667673	I think Just Dance sells well because it's got the right name.
1669416	1670657	Dance Central, Just Dance Dance Paradise
1695590	1698931	I don't know, except only ones I'd seen were Dance Masters and Dance Central.
1698951	1700532	The only one I've tried is Dance Central.
1700652	1712096	I would love to see a dance game with like half Konami-ish songs, half Dance Central-ish songs in the Dance Masters interface because I think there's some cool things that Dance Masters brings to the table.
1712116	1712917	I want more Parapara.
1712937	1717918	Well, then you would be talking about part of my pitch for a new DDR game, of course.
1718559	1718879	You see...
1719699	1721401	All right, let me get to some quick, quick thoughts.
1721521	1722602	We want to get on to Sony.
1722682	1724544	I want to get to Bobby and all that.
1725525	1726085	Quick thoughts.
1726566	1727386	Fable the Journey.
1729949	1733372	Here's my problem with necessarily... Fable the Journey looks good.
1733392	1736075	I mean, it looks nice because it's in Unreal 3 now.
1737035	1738597	Here's my problem with the Kinect games, though.
1738957	1740359	Everything's on fucking rails.
1740839	1742761	Everything is on fucking rails.
1743137	1746461	Doesn't a Halo rail shooter make more sense than a Fable rail shooter?
1746561	1748563	Everything is on fucking rails!
1749084	1750966	The Ghost Recon game, on rails.
1751166	1752868	The Fable game, on rails.
1752988	1754410	Star Wars, on rails.
1755190	1757373	That's all they can do is on rail shooters.
1757573	1758654	They can't actually do...
1760195	1762697	Anything where you have actual control.
1763737	1768959	That's where one thing that PlayStation has over, you know, the Kinect is, hey, you know what?
1769260	1770500	We have a navigation controller.
1770820	1774282	We can navigate around the map whereas you guys are stuck on a rail.
1774542	1776563	You need the Xbox nunchuck.
1779561	1785663	I'm coming off of Fable 3, which I talked about on last week's OLR, and I was not feeling that great about Fable 3.
1785803	1790424	So when I saw this preview, I was just kind of, eh, if it's $20 maybe.
1790704	1791584	Yeah, it looked alright.
1791824	1795885	It would be a pretty cool Xbox Live Arcade game, and I liked how the perspective's a little different.
1796185	1799626	It actually kind of reminded me of, because it is an on-rails shooter.
1800069	1800369	DarkSakura,
1819338	1819919	Thanks for watching!
1835925	1842690	I felt bad for him but of course the games are still early on so there you go did I miss anything else?
1844012	1863327	Tom Clancy game was shown as well Gears of War 3 actually the one that looks kind of cool is Rise the new Crytek game the Roman one I saw the dude kicking in that and I was like he's gonna kick his Kinect right off the TV I can't play that in my house
1863507	1864969	I can see the achievement now.
1865049	1866631	This is Sparta!
1868474	1869855	Every time I do that.
1871775	1875076	But that's why a game like that will sell because there's going to be a lot of 17-year-old guys.
1875096	1875716	It looks good, though.
1875736	1876756	See, that's the thing, though.
1876836	1884798	It's an actual... But as long as the combat's good and not clunky like Fighters Uncaged or something like that, I don't know.
1885958	1887659	There was a lot of cool stuff that they showed.
1887679	1889499	Forza 4 looks pretty awesome.
1890059	1892840	And the head tracking stuff in that, once again, also kind of laggy.
1893200	1897601	But I don't really know how you would be able to do that anyways because you can't really turn your...
1897921	1900124	Dan, you're a racing game fan, Forza?
1912438	1913739	Forza looks great.
1913819	1915240	It's a great looking racing game.
1915260	1917061	Did you see their new steering wheel that they have?
1917522	1920444	That looks like butt.
1920784	1921785	$60 wireless steering wheel.
1922145	1922885	What's the point?
1923986	1925427	Oh, you can wave it around in midair.
1926068	1926668	Sweet.
1927289	1930010	Gears of War 3, Ice-T reuniting.
1930471	1931792	Why does he always look angry?
1932132	1933273	He's like, I'm hardcore.
1933293	1933693	He's Ice-T.
1935054	1939077	You know, it's like every, I don't understand why he, he's just like scowling the entire time.
1939097	1941399	He looked angry because he was playing Gears of War.
1941819	1942400	I understand.
1942420	1943541	Which is a testosterone game for men.
1943601	1945122	Everybody in Gears of War looks angry.
1945182	1952808	Well, you don't have to like be all, you know, fronting like you're just, you know, I'm gonna murder somebody after I'm done playing this game.
1953388	1958012	Although I gotta say though, the Gears of War 3 limited edition Xbox looks pretty nice.
1958152	1958972	The black and red one?
1959072	1959373	Yeah.
1959393	1959613	Looks good.
1959873	1961274	All right, quickly, I got to get to Bobby.
1961334	1964876	I want to quickly just mention the EA press conference that happened.
1964896	1969198	Mass Effect 3, interesting voice command thing going on there.
1969318	1969818	Useless.
1970138	1970738	How quick?
1971179	1972039	I would never use that.
1972199	1972739	I would never.
1972799	1977502	I mean, is it a great demo thing to show off your console to your friends?
1977542	1980083	Like, look at this space minority report technology.
1980303	1981344	It's fun for like five minutes.
1981364	1984225	Commanding your troops or whatever to do different things.
1984485	1984805	Maybe.
1984885	1985826	I don't know if that was like...
1986206	1987347	Part, yeah, I could see that.
1987367	1993132	But, like, doing the actual dialogue trees and stuff, I have a directional pad right in my thumb.
1993312	1995434	Why do I need to even bother with this bullshit?
1997743	2000124	Star Wars The Old Republic What was up with that guy?
2000184	2003804	Mr. Caffeine by the way, when you actually go to a show and see Mr. Caffeine in person, he's amazing.
2023497	2045349	Far Cry 3 was the only game I'd really seen and I was like there was part of the dialogue to me felt like it was trying to be too edgy I was like this game is fucking edgy when it showed the dude doing the stealth kills where he like walked up behind the guy pulled the knife out of the guy's pocket and stabbed him with it a little part of me my heart grew three sizes the game parts were cool I mean I'm not gonna play it but man
2045689	2047451	I like the fact that you don't have malaria
2065762	2066362	I am here, what's up guys?
2066382	2067543	How's the weather in L.A. ?
2096703	2100026	Um, not as warm as it is in Atlanta right now.
2100927	2102248	What an interesting change of pace.
2102288	2103248	It's been raining up here.
2103268	2104149	Alright, forget the weather.
2105570	2105650	E3.
2106171	2107612	How did day one treat you?
2109053	2110033	Um, my feet hurt.
2110954	2111194	Right.
2111655	2113636	But it was a lot of standing around.
2114057	2115538	It was a lot of standing around.
2115918	2118680	Yeah, because you waited all day today to play Wii U, didn't you?
2120001	2122843	Yes, I was about two hours before I got in there.
2122863	2125025	But then I had about an hour and a half.
2126142	2127744	to kind of go through their eight demos.
2128104	2131006	Two hours actually isn't that bad, all things considered.
2131026	2136511	Did they have entertainment in the Wii line this year, or Wii U, excuse me, line to keep you going?
2138212	2142956	No, and actually, when I walked up to it, it was about two o'clock, and the show floor closes at six.
2143436	2149962	And I walked up at two, and there was a lady at the end, there was the sign that said, line closed.
2150542	2152824	And I said, is it already full?
2152964	2153845	And she's like, well...
2154437	2155760	Yeah, we've cut off the line.
2156561	2162573	You're more than welcome to stay in here, but realize you may not get up to the front, and you may waste the rest of your day here.
2163254	2163896	And I said, okay.
2164628	2164788	Oh wow.
2164808	2171613	And I got up there and it wound up two hours later, you know, four o'clock, I'm starting to play with the Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii U. That's not that bad.
2171653	2173174	I guess they were just trying to scare people away.
2173414	2183421	That's not that bad, all things considered, because the lines in the past, like the 3DS line was atrocious last year, and then of course the original Wii line, we all saw those videos on the internet of just the line keeps going and going and going.
2183721	2184682	That line was awesome.
2185022	2193528	Alright, anyhow, we'll get to Nintendo in a minute, but let's start by talking about Sony, because Sony happened yesterday, and you were there at the press conference, right Bobby?
2194773	2195193	Correct.
2195673	2196794	So, how was it?
2197674	2200155	You got, like, right in the front, practically, didn't you?
2201815	2204276	Yeah, it was kind of funny because I got there a little late.
2204316	2210338	Like, I took the shuttle from my hotel at, like, and it started at 5, and so I got on the bus at about 4, 4.05.
2212199	2212759	And in L.A.
2212779	2220582	traffic, it was, like, 4.55 when we finally pulled up to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is on USC campus.
2221502	2221742	So...
2222620	2226542	We finally pull up and I'm like watching everybody and we can't get off the bus.
2226582	2229804	It takes us like 15 minutes just to get around the corner into the parking lot.
2230925	2233366	And we're all like kind of walking in and stuff.
2233406	2238869	I missed all the food in the beginning and all that stuff because I was hungry because I hadn't eaten since Atlanta that morning.
2239870	2244592	And I made it all the way... You guys still there?
2244852	2245313	Yeah, we're here.
2246673	2247034	Okay.
2247674	2249315	Something cut off on my phone.
2249375	2249615	Anyway...
2250847	2259333	So I was walking in, running in, and before I went through the door, there was a guy saying, hey, there's more seats if you go down this ramp to the VIP area.
2259974	2262256	So I'm like, okay, I'll go down that ramp.
2263436	2274004	And so we went down that ramp, and it went underneath, and we were on the floor area, and people were just directing us, and they pointed to these seats, like folding chairs on the floor, and
2274842	2303142	right in front of the stage and there were like a lot of Sony employees sitting there and so I was sitting there with them and then all the Sony employees got kicked out and more people came in and I realized everybody else that was sitting around me like Michael Pachter and them all had these red VIP lanyards and I didn't have one of those so I was kind of like covering up my shirt or something so it looked like I had a lanyard and they never noticed you were just in the right place at the right time
2304462	2306043	Every time the camera was on me, I was tweaking.
2328132	2328432	Nice.
2329553	2331996	Let's talk a little bit about what happened at the Sony press conference.
2332116	2348390	Obviously, we're going to get to Taboo when we come back with the Orange Launch Radio next Sunday, the regular episodes, but I lost a point in Taboo because Sony just opened right off the bat with somewhat of an apology, and one that it seems like most people accepted.
2349784	2350084	Loki?
2350245	2351346	Loki's shaking his head a little bit.
2351486	2352186	It was retarded.
2352567	2352827	Really?
2352847	2357332	It's like, yeah, we learned a valuable lesson with this PlayStation Outage set.
2358253	2360535	We realized how much you like playing online.
2360675	2361956	That's all they fucking learned.
2362237	2363598	That's all they learned.
2363638	2368122	It was not like, oh, hey, we're sorry that your credit card information was compromised.
2368202	2368483	It was...
2369795	2371276	Hey, you guys like playing online.
2371456	2373357	We're going to focus more on online play.
2373838	2375819	Let me ask the chat room how they feel about it.
2375879	2378020	Chat room at chat.orange.com.
2378080	2379781	Were you satisfied with Sony's apology?
2380202	2380722	What do you think?
2381042	2383964	Bobby, how did that go over in the crowd there and with you?
2386065	2390248	Well, first off, it was kind of interesting because you notice he never said they got hacked.
2391109	2391209	Right.
2391229	2392169	They called it an outage.
2392469	2392690	Right.
2392710	2394331	They didn't say why it was an outage.
2394631	2394811	Mm-hmm.
2395464	2407186	But a lot of people around us, and you gotta realize since I'm in the VIP section, I'm around people who've been in the industry 20 years and all that stuff, and they kind of were more understanding than the people that were probably up in the normal seats and people at home.
2407867	2417048	So they were like, okay, he did mention it, and Jack, he always, he does really good on stage.
2417849	2424330	Like every year, you know, because he always goes up there and something is like bad press for Sony whenever he walks up at E3.
2425703	2428624	and he and his script writers handle it really well.
2430825	2434187	That was scripted because I can see the teleprompters from where I was.
2434927	2438528	I knew how much of the entire press conference was actually scripted.
2438949	2451674	He did a good job and it stopped people from heckling him because that was one of the things somebody asked me on Twitter is how many people were going to interrupt the conference yelling about the PSN hack and nobody did.
2452301	2456582	because they addressed it right in the beginning and said, hey, here's the elephant in the room.
2456622	2457102	Here it is.
2457743	2458203	We're sorry.
2459583	2462104	Going to some comments from our chat room at chat.orange.com.
2462184	2464725	Ranma in the chat room says, that was not an apology.
2464765	2467366	That was more of a thank you for the fans for sticking out.
2467546	2468406	That's a good way of putting it.
2468526	2469066	Yeah.
2469126	2470547	Technus says, yeah, it was okay.
2470707	2472167	It was mainly a canned response.
2472947	2475148	DarkTetsuya says, better him than Kazurai.
2476788	2478729	Techie Q says, where was Kevin Butler?
2478909	2479209	Uh-huh.
2479469	2480189	Good question.
2480610	2481790	Did you spot Kevin Butler there?
2483268	2485610	No, I did not spot Kevin Butler.
2485630	2492495	He was there last year, but I think they're like, okay, we did that joke, and now we can move on.
2492695	2497178	I just had to say, though, that it really did sound quite a bit more sincere than the other canned stuff we had before.
2511351	2513772	Yeah, it was one of those things where it could have been a lot worse.
2514793	2531703	But seeing as most of the Twittersphere at the end of the day seems to be dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, again, I'm making broad generalizations, but most of the Twitter that I'm looking at is dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, but is kind of praising Sony, I would say, distraction successful.
2532703	2535065	I think that Sony... That was a distraction event.
2535445	2535685	Right.
2537286	2538867	But it's exactly what their PR needed.
2540718	2552841	Speaking of audience reaction, Bobby, since you were there, how was it when you, in the theater, when it was announced that the PlayStation Vita is going to be exclusive 3G on AT&T?
2552921	2555242	Because I can tell you, we heard it pretty clear.
2555582	2556882	How bad was it where you were?
2557102	2558623	Was it really a lot of groans?
2559763	2566225	It wasn't loud, but I mean, I heard like all the laughter of, yeah, we figured it, and all the groans.
2567193	2593870	and we could even see Kaz was kind of like not expecting that I think if he had said the word Verizon instead it would have been a much different reaction but no it was very that was the one negative part of their press conference was that yeah I thought he didn't present it very well because honestly enough I was in the chat I was watching online and so I was watching the people chatting in the sidebar and those people are absolute blithering idiots but they were just like does that mean I can only get it through AT&T
2595302	2596543	And it's like, oh my god.
2597083	2598704	Please, just die.
2598905	2603248	Well, it just struck me as interesting because I feel like he started to say something else.
2603648	2607931	Like that deal had just been sealed within the past 48 hours.
2608691	2610533	He wasn't quite prepared to say that.
2611473	2612714	That's how it came across to me.
2612834	2613875	That's what E3 is all about.
2614115	2615716	I have AT&T on my iPhone.
2615856	2617637	I'm one of those people that's like, whatever.
2617697	2618738	I'm hoping there's a deal.
2618838	2622900	As we have iPhone plans, that doesn't mean that we get on for free.
2624081	2628243	I'm not buying a 3G PS Vita, Velveeta, whatever.
2628263	2628683	Screw that.
2628743	2634487	Just tether to your iPhone or tether to whatever.
2635154	2636995	Well, let's talk about the Vita.
2637475	2640057	Bobby, I'll let you start it off since you were there.
2640137	2642318	What was kind of the reaction to the Vita that you saw?
2642358	2643078	What did you observe?
2645359	2653383	The people that were around me, they're like, okay, why are they saying that this is the first time we've ever had augmented reality on a handheld because of the cameras?
2654564	2659807	And why are they saying that this is the first time you've been able to do such and such when they're listing features of the 3DS?
2661448	2663349	But a lot of people are saying, okay,
2665262	2666523	I can see why they're doing it.
2667023	2668563	They think it's priced too high.
2670284	2675106	It's also not the first time they've done it on a PlayStation Portable.
2675346	2683949	They have the camera for their stupid iPad game and also for the Invisimals and stuff like that.
2684549	2689511	Well, interesting because a lot of the folks I was seeing online were really happy with that price point saying, oh,
2689531	2694155	and here's one of the things that somebody said was that if it had HDMI output sold interesting what about that whole go ahead
2717888	2719229	I did not get to play the Vita.
2719269	2726713	They had it there, but it was a long-ass line, and I decided that taking part in their distraction booze was more important.
2727593	2730275	So I haven't been able to play the Vita yet, but they did have it there.
2731188	2735152	but nobody I knew had stood in the line because, like I said, there was distraction booze.
2735492	2737233	Right, right.
2738494	2742077	You were kind of talking about the whole HDMI out and all that.
2742518	2751705	One of the games, and I'm sure this was the one that caught most people's attention, was The Ruin, the dungeon crawler, where they were playing it on the PSP and then did the trans-farring...
2752586	2752726	Right.
2752746	2757229	Yeah, and the question that I have about that is, do you have to be a PlayStation Plus member for the cloud savings?
2771221	2775545	I would think so, yes, but obviously those are the details they want to leave out.
2775885	2777967	Let me get to some of the immediate chat comments about the Vita.
2778567	2783792	TigerClaw says, I gotta admit, the PS Vita for $249.99 is a pretty good price given all the tech that's in it.
2784993	2788716	Savalas in our chatroom says, does my new Vita have a firewall to protect me from hacks?
2789357	2792479	Janai says, I will buy one, but it will feel like an updated PSP.
2793260	2798264	FrisbeeU says, nope, price is okay, but doesn't have any good games.
2798724	2800886	Zappy says, I need a Vita.
2801307	2805150	Uncharted, Wipeout, Little Deviants, and LittleBigPlanet look great.
2807391	2811795	Now, TigerClaw said something here, and I want to kind of point this out.
2811835	2814657	He said the PS Vita produced PS3 quality graphics.
2815078	2816058	That is incorrect.
2817279	2822864	It is comparable to the PS3 because the Vita has a smaller resolution.
2823720	2828265	But it could not do 1080p PS3 quality graphics.
2828345	2831228	It's because of the resolution of the screen is not 1080p.
2831828	2841158	It's able, and it's also the screen is smaller, it's able to get away with making something that is comparable to the PS3, but it is not exact to the PS3.
2841318	2844561	Hence why maybe the HDMI output may not be such a good idea.
2844781	2846163	It may kind of ruin the quality.
2847591	2847691	Right.
2847711	2847851	Right.
2847871	2848611	Right.
2877358	2879699	It went over well.
2879739	2881080	Everybody liked that.
2882160	2889763	A lot of people around me are like, why are they... Because the people that were around me in the VIP section, they're older than me.
2890303	2893104	And they're like, God, do we really need more 3D?
2893284	2895945	Why are they pushing the 3D stuff on me?
2897025	2899526	So that was kind of mixed in my area.
2899626	2902707	I think it got more pop up in the seats.
2903569	2932394	but what's interesting is that they had Ken Levine come out to talk about him doing the Vita and they did not show Ratchet and Clank which they had back there and they didn't show Twisted Metal which they had playable on that floor at the end and so they left some of those out the only game I played after that was LittleBigPlanet 2 with the move support oh what did you think?
2934639	2936620	They did kind of what we expected.
2936660	2938500	It's not Sackboy's prehistoric move.
2938540	2939741	They did something a little different.
2940241	2944302	And I got to play some of the story levels in one of their minigames.
2945963	2950524	And the main tool that they give you is I think it's like the Braininator or something.
2950865	2952685	But it's where you actually move things.
2952725	2957967	So you're still playing a little bit exactly the way that you're used to with the buttons and the sticks and everything.
2958007	2963509	And you're just moving things around and bouncing yourself off with some of these
2964056	2991446	and they did a really good job with it and then they've got a mini game that they had me play where it's one of those like it's kind of like cut the rope a little bit where there's a ball at the top and you're trying to get it to the end but you have to place things and then when you release the ball it kind of goes through this Rube Goldberg machine that you've created and that was kind of neat so this is something that's going to be like free patch free upgrade for LittleBigPlanet 2 right?
2992699	2993540	I believe so.
2993800	2995301	It's not something I'm going to have to buy separately.
2995321	2999663	They better, because on the box of LittleBigPlanet 2 it says better with PlayStation Move.
2999703	3004126	It's got the Move logo, but it's not part of the game right now.
3004366	3012251	So I think that'd be kind of stupid if they put that on the box and said, oh, but you've got to pay extra to get that part that's in the blue sticker on the front of the box.
3012271	3013472	It's just better if you own it.
3014112	3015233	It just makes you feel good.
3016038	3016398	Good job, Jeremy.
3016418	3016839	Good job, Jeremy.
3043314	3049325	Wasn't that the same guy that showed out the stupid medieval tech demo last time when they were first showing off the move stuff?
3052110	3055696	The medieval tech demo last time was the sports champions thing, I think.
3056365	3057386	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3057406	3058907	There was another move being shown.
3078101	3078441	What's that?
3078501	3081022	Kobe Bryant came out and sucked at it.
3081282	3082762	I was just about to say that.
3082802	3086223	Yeah, the other big guest that was at Sony's press conference was the Kobe Bryant moment.
3086604	3088844	And I tweeted you and I'm like, quick, throw your shoe.
3090505	3091945	Yeah, but I like my shoe too much.
3092865	3095146	What kind of reaction did Kobe get from the crowd?
3095766	3097627	Because it sounded very mixed.
3098867	3100168	It was, I mean, he got some pops.
3100568	3107690	And, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, when he kind of made jokes about himself or something, that got some reactions, but
3111923	3116946	It was a pretty resounding endorsement by him as well.
3116986	3124751	I mean, I'm sure he gets paid handsomely to say it, but still, you know, you couldn't help but feel the little punch in the gut to EA after what happened to them last year.
3125352	3125452	So...
3127233	3127553	HGMI Cable, $499
3156560	3157160	3D Monitor.
3157800	3158661	3D Monitor.
3158821	3163342	Oh, so it won't actually get TV signal.
3163402	3165063	I guess it probably doesn't have an antenna built in.
3165163	3168844	Right, and it's probably going to be sized like your computer monitor.
3168864	3171825	Like, I don't know if they said what size it would be.
3171845	3172405	24-inch.
3172425	3173725	24, so you're right on the money.
3174185	3175105	Yeah, 24-inch.
3175125	3177146	So that's not really TV.
3177266	3178126	That's a monitor.
3178386	3181307	Also, I want to just mention something because I know I'm going to go back.
3181567	3182528	I'm watching chat, too.
3182708	3183028	That's fine.
3183048	3183628	Randy, you...
3184298	3184899	That's true.
3197153	3201317	Me too, because that means traffic on Thursday won't be as bad as it was the year before.
3201337	3209344	I thought it was interesting the way he marketed it when he was mentioning the new monitor.
3209724	3211426	It's perfect for a dorm room.
3211586	3217251	I thought that right there was a huge, like, we know exactly who needs this and who our audience is for this.
3217471	3218892	And I think that was right on the money.
3219232	3223196	I think that's going to cause this thing to get on a lot of college wish lists this year.
3226764	3229165	except for me except for you, not interested?
3229545	3252755	oh yeah, because you don't do 3D I can't see the 3D and actually, it screwed me up because I was so close and at an angle and I put those glasses on because they were showing a lot of us a lot of trailers in 3D it was actually messing me up because I usually if I'm looking straight at it it's fine, it's just a darker 2D except for maybe some things at the edges
3253480	3256921	but being at that angle, it sucked.
3257061	3280565	Now one thing that they said they were going to do with the 3D technology, this is the stuff with the technology that I really am looking forward to and I would actually be confused, is because they do the shutter technology, they have, you know, they've actually implemented, and I don't know if they're showing it here or not, where, you know, instead of having each eye shutter differently, they have each pair of glasses shuttered differently,
3281115	3286497	You can actually have two different screens or people seeing two different images on screen.
3286757	3287737	That is awesome.
3287917	3291019	Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too and very wave of the future.
3291159	3292579	Very much so.
3293239	3297601	I want to get to Nintendo here in a minute, but a couple of things I've got to mention out of the Sony press conference.
3297641	3306004	We won't have time to hit everything, but DarkSakura, I know you had been looking at Star Trek The Game and some of the announcements that were made around that.
3306044	3309125	Did you hear about the PlayStation Move that's going to look like a phaser?
3309145	3309225	Yeah.
3310197	3314260	I'm trying to get an appointment to see the game I hope so too I want to count the lens flares
3337835	3341958	But with anything that new, I'm going to keep my judgment reserved.
3342278	3343619	I don't think you can count that high.
3344000	3350025	But I mean, they are investing a lot into this because it wasn't just this official game, but I guess a PSN precursor.
3350145	3355089	I guess what comes to mind, Dead Rising 2K0-esque thing for the Star Wars game.
3355109	3357991	I'm sorry, excuse me, Star Trek game is supposed to be there as well.
3359032	3361654	More information next year, a little closer to the movie's launch, I'm sure.
3362094	3370082	Loki, I gotta let you have a moment because they did mention at the PlayStation 3 conference exclusives coming to Saints Row the 3rd and I know you've gotta have an opinion on that game
3370362	3373123	I don't really care about the exclusives that they have coming to that.
3373183	3374383	I'm still getting it on 360.
3375083	3375403	Really?
3375543	3376483	But what about the game itself?
3376703	3378304	The game looks fucking amazing.
3379444	3385505	I saw some gameplay footage they had during an interview prior to one of the conferences.
3387065	3391566	They have the guy just doing rustling moves on random pedestrians.
3392286	3396167	They even showed the giant purple dildo weapon and stuff like that.
3396767	3397247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3418653	3419193	I can't wait.
3419334	3421635	I have to admit, I approve of that approach.
3421695	3422536	Like, you know what?
3422916	3423396	Go big.
3423576	3424977	But here's the thing, too.
3425097	3427819	Like, I watched this morning the trailer.
3428200	3434084	They have a new trailer out there for Postal 3, and I gotta tell you, it looks like shit.
3434704	3436865	Because they're like, oh, look how edgy we are.
3437006	3437646	No, I'm sorry.
3437706	3439447	Saints Row 3 blows that shit away.
3439527	3444451	It's like, who gives a fuck that you have, you know, a guy dressed up like a nutsack?
3444491	3444831	Who cares?
3444851	3445111	Who cares?
3445771	3450073	There's a weapon that's a giant purple penis that you can hit people with in Saints Row 3.
3450533	3454074	If you want to do edgy, you're going to have to make a game based on the Human Centipede Part 2.
3456235	3460396	I don't know how much room we have for masturbating with barbed wire.
3460956	3466118	Anyway, did you see on the PS Vita, and Dan, I know you are a fighting game fan.
3466138	3466698	Hang on.
3468279	3470840	I want to interject on the Saints Row thing real quick.
3470920	3471700	I haven't seen it yet.
3472824	3476388	They have done the most genius marketing here at E3.
3477308	3477769	What's that?
3478369	3488358	They bought or rented out for the week that parking lot across the street from Staples Center and offered free parking to all E3 attendees that get in there.
3488978	3492942	And they have bikini models at the entrance trying to direct people in.
3493322	3494583	They've got tents in there.
3494683	3496865	They've got it all decked out in Saints Row.
3498769	3499129	Awesome.
3500310	3501750	I know where we're going Thursday.
3501870	3502391	No doubt.
3503171	3504812	All right.
3505552	3507072	Dan, I know you're a fighting game fan.
3509093	3510694	Jamie's giving her husband a stare down.
3511234	3511894	Jamie, come on.
3511934	3512515	You know you want to see.
3512755	3514856	You know, this is radio, so no one can see that.
3514916	3517997	Jamie, even you have to admit, boobies.
3519673	3520273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3545706	3546567	It's a 2D fighter?
3546808	3548029	Made out of a 3D fighter?
3548330	3550152	That got very little reaction.
3555543	3569027	Well, the thing was it was weird to me because as much as I like that idea of Street Fighter X Tekken, then they announce, okay, so it's Street Fighter World and Tekken World collides, and then we're going to throw in Cole from Infamous.
3569267	3572328	And it's like, what does he have to do with anything?
3572348	3574249	Because Namco likes throwing in random characters.
3574269	3580831	They're like, if we're going to put our Tekken franchise on the line here, we've got to have random people who have nothing to do with the universe in it.
3581591	3584132	We can't have Darth Vader, so here's Cole.
3585396	3586077	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3603433	3604033	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3633581	3636603	You can have shit.
3636683	3638764	Actually, I can make it all the way through Tekken Street Mode with Gon.
3639484	3643446	Alright, we gotta get to the next press conference this morning.
3643826	3644326	Nintendo.
3644607	3646568	Let's talk about Nintendo for a little bit.
3646588	3650289	I'm gonna leave the room so that I can actually hear Loki without going deaf.
3650670	3651190	What's that, Bobby?
3652486	3653967	You don't want me to talk about Jane's Addiction?
3654627	3655447	Oh, yeah!
3656468	3662730	I totally forgot to ask Bobby about what happened behind the scenes at the Sony press conference before we get to Nintendo.
3662870	3666372	When we're watching at home, it cuts out at the end, but you were there for what?
3666412	3667772	Like two and a half more hours, right?
3669273	3670373	Yeah, it ended at ten.
3670674	3670954	Wow.
3671814	3672494	So what was happening?
3673875	3678657	At the end of the press conference, the entire stage went away and that's where all their demo kiosks were.
3679238	3689203	And they brought food, lots of food, like grilled cheese sandwiches and pasta salad and cookies and cupcakes and other, like, it was great.
3689544	3692125	And then beer and alcohol flowing open bar.
3692865	3694706	And then at 9 o'clock, James Addiction comes on.
3696007	3699049	Which, you know, I'm like, okay, I saw them in Activision last year, so I'm good.
3699449	3701470	But they came out and did an hour set.
3703027	3706748	and for no particular reason then, hey, we got Jane's Addiction because we're so many.
3706768	3708028	They better did Bin Cut Ceiling.
3708208	3710549	Well, they had Mix Master Mike there too.
3711469	3712290	I love him too.
3713070	3713310	Wow.
3714190	3724853	And it would be like him, like they were like just, they had all their trailers of their games but like it was messing with the color and everything and that was kind of the visuals around.
3725133	3731535	But they also like had all these like scantily clad women like on top of the stages, areas that were like
3732268	3743512	still doing like doing slow dances and stuff and it was to the techno music and it was kind of weird because we're sitting there playing video games while there's like a hot chick above us like kind of doing a pole game.
3747133	3748594	So I guess they knew their audience.
3748694	3749214	All right.
3749594	3751294	So and how many Sony beers did you have again?
3753315	3753495	What?
3753635	3755116	How many Sony beers did you have again?
3756616	3758977	Honestly because they had crappy beers only one.
3759037	3761578	Tonight is the night that I'm going to have way too many beers.
3762363	3764545	They had crappy beer?
3764585	3765146	I'm so sorry.
3765686	3769670	We gotta get through Nintendo's press conference so that Bobby can get to the beer drinking.
3770591	3771211	But you know what?
3771371	3774994	Bobby, with all due respect, I gotta let Loki kick this one off.
3775054	3779018	So, Loki, why don't you give us a little report on Nintendo's press conference?
3779420	3788428	So Nintendo came out and basically showed off some of their 3DS stuff and no one cared.
3790229	3795194	No, they started off actually by talking about the Zelda 25th Anniversary Edition.
3795594	3796515	Which was awesome.
3797023	3821856	which you know they had like an orchestra they had an orchestra they had Miyamoto out there and my Zelda fanboy Saul was like yes it was beautiful and then they were talking about how they're kind of celebrating on all the different platforms for the 3DS of course you had you know the Game Boy Color Zelda game that's available for download on there it's gonna be the first one the Game Boy Color Virtual Console I bought it
3823613	3824373	Sucker!
3826114	3834037	And then for the Nintendo Wii, obviously, Skyward Sword is going to be available later this year.
3834917	3844281	For the DSiWare, which I'm assuming also means the 3DS as well, they're going to have Zelda The Four Swords Adventure as a free download, which is kind of cool.
3845601	3847162	Too bad it's not playable by itself, though.
3848603	3849003	And then...
3852679	3870535	And then, of course, they're also going to do some sort of pre-order bonus for the 3DS with Ocarina that you're going to be able to get a music CD with the soundtrack from the game for if you register the game quite early on the Nintendo Club thing.
3872017	3874639	And then, of course, they're going to do some sort of orchestra...
3876961	3879422	Live shows and stuff like that with the Zelda music.
3879822	3881502	It's going to be all over the world.
3883402	3887703	They're going to have a CD for that that's going to be available with the Skyward Sword game.
3888963	3892544	And then 3DS stuff, they showed off the new Mario game, which looks kind of cool.
3892564	3897485	It's kind of like a cross between Mario Galaxy and Mario 64, which is not bad.
3898065	3901346	And then Star Fox, they showed a little bit of that.
3901786	3903266	It's just souped up Star Fox 64.
3903306	3903366	Um...
3907508	3908208	Luigi's Mansion 2
3929032	3929392	It was cute.
3929473	3930313	It has its fans.
3930373	3937078	Actually, the best part of it was when you went into the attic, and then the lightning would flash, and then his shadow would be hanging by a noose.
3938719	3942041	So, and then, okay, so they do the Kid Icarus and all these 3DS games.
3942061	3944803	The Kid Icarus, and then Mario Kart, what the fuck's up with Mario Kart, okay?
3945123	3951828	Mario Kart, now with, you know, monster trucks and, you know, hang gliders, and that's innovative.
3952987	3955872	And they're like, you've never raced this game before.
3955932	3960360	And all the first few tracks that they were showing were all tracks from other games.
3960420	3963887	I'm like, actually, yes, I have raced every single one of those.
3966977	3969939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3991176	4018950	and then they go to say hey what are we calling this thing uh well you know how everybody hated the name Wii but then they eventually got used to it and stuff we got another one for you Wii U what I like seriously they said Wii U is the name of that I was like my brain hurts for how stupid this is but you know people will get used to it they can still change their mind
4020405	4024849	Dan and I were saying before the show, what if they just called it the Nintendo U?
4025129	4028371	I think that would have been like U as in Ultra IDK.
4028832	4030053	I think Nintendo U would have been fine.
4030613	4031334	Well, here's the problem.
4031354	4035337	They have to do Wii because people are fucking stupid and they're not going to understand.
4035777	4037058	I can use my Wii stuff.
4037439	4040141	See, then they know that they can use their Wii stuff with it.
4040821	4041121	Great.
4041141	4049148	The big problem is already everyone's kind of half assuming, I thought it was a new system, not just a new controller.
4050888	4051669	It is a new system.
4051969	4052930	It is a new system.
4053190	4053971	People don't know that.
4054011	4057835	They're just like, oh, I just use it with my existing Wii.
4057935	4063400	I know Bobby is dying to jump in here in a minute here, but let me let Loki wrap up here.
4065262	4067124	What other impressions did Wii U leave you with?
4068218	4074960	Um, it's a neat piece of hardware, but it's just, it just seems so gimmicky to me.
4075160	4078461	I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, how expensive is it?
4078941	4083322	I mean, some of the graphics, like their little tech demo pre-rendered thing look kind of cool, you know, what it does.
4083742	4086583	But the whole conference, they didn't fucking announce anything.
4086923	4089024	Oh, okay, they hinted that Smash Bros.
4089104	4092785	is coming to, you know, the Wii U and 3DS.
4092885	4096726	They hinted at that, and then they said, oh, but that's going to be, you know, a while down.
4096946	4099388	Yeah, just like they hinted at Pikmin coming out.
4099408	4100649	And how long has that been?
4101349	4102590	Oh wait, it's still not out yet.
4103271	4104652	So, you know, Smash Bros.
4104672	4108555	Oh, let's get them all excited and promise this game that's not going to come out for two years.
4109956	4116661	And then Wii U. And I'm sorry, it's just like the tech demos they showed off.
4117701	4125207	Oh hey, look, I can play Wii Sports Golf and I can put this controller on the ground and make it so I can see a ball there and stuff.
4125836	4127257	All right, Bobby's been waiting patiently.
4127337	4133582	Bobby, what do you think about them showing just a controller and not really showing the specs of the console off?
4135284	4137525	Wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo.
4138366	4138586	Sorry.
4139367	4141188	Gunpow entered the pit.
4141469	4142890	Is there a fire truck driving by?
4145712	4149415	So, well, first I want to jump in because we started with the 3DS stuff.
4149915	4150576	Sure, go ahead.
4151801	4156122	and I do want to mention that I have like 100 Street Pass me's now.
4156442	4157162	It's like awesome.
4157182	4160883	I've almost got like all the puzzle pieces of all puzzles.
4162063	4170044	But I played Mario Kart 3DS because they had a couple of games out in tents and stuff.
4170384	4173125	And I actually did play it and I enjoyed it.
4173225	4174205	It is Mario Kart.
4174225	4179026	I mean all did the same tricks on how to boost around corners and stuff is still there.
4179856	4183498	and stuff, but to me it was Mario Kart meets Diddy Kong Racing.
4184539	4184939	How so?
4186781	4201690	With all the different ways that you could, you know, like either you would be a plane or you'd go underwater which they didn't really do underwater in Diddy Kong Racing, but like with the planes and stuff and monster trucks and having the different types of vehicles and stuff.
4201750	4207454	So that's kind of what it reminded me of, but it was still Mario Kart and, you know, it's
4207782	4210623	For fans of Mario Kart, they'll love it.
4223170	4225292	Do people really give a shit about more vehicle types?
4225612	4231677	What they want you to do is they want you to come up with some new tracks and stop fucking repeating tracks from every goddamn game that you've already released.
4231917	4238002	It would be nice to hear just a tinge about the online capability because 3DS already has better online than the Wii.
4238282	4240424	So I would like to hear more about that.
4240444	4240804	But Bobby?
4242825	4252693	Well, I mean, the tracks that they had in the demo that I played, you know, because the ones like that went underwater, you know, and there is, you know, different physics underwater.
4253388	4258210	and, you know, gliding through the air and having to determine where you're going to glide and when you're going to go up and down.
4258630	4261392	So, I mean, the demo had new tracks.
4261892	4264793	I don't recognize any of the tracks that were in the demo.
4264813	4271196	Now, the trailer probably showed tracks that you might have seen, you know, segments of tracks that you've seen before.
4271976	4276659	But, you know, like, yeah, there's a track that looks like the Donkey Kong tracks from the N64.
4277059	4278279	But it's not the same layout.
4278579	4279820	It just has the same scenery.
4281997	4286579	So don't write it off based on the three second snippets in the trailers.
4287299	4290000	Because it does, it changes enough.
4290060	4295622	I mean, granted, yes, it's still Mario Kart, and yes, it's still, you know, not new but fun, maybe.
4295682	4296023	I don't know.
4296343	4299944	But, you know, a lot of people are like, what's wrong with more of what I liked?
4300544	4303666	It's just like how they thought it was necessary to put motorcycles in the Wii version.
4304366	4305126	Who gives a shit?
4305186	4306107	It's a kart racing game.
4306127	4307347	You don't need fucking motorcycles.
4307867	4309308	Oh, now let's put monster trucks in there.
4310279	4310900	Excite Boats
4328675	4330155	Let me throw out this question for the chat room.
4330596	4336837	For all you folks in chat who do not currently own a 3DS, are you interested in 3DS now?
4337377	4338498	They showed more titles.
4339298	4342759	I thought it was interesting, and that's the question I've got for our chat, chat.orange.radio.com.
4342819	4344039	Are you interested in a 3DS now?
4344499	4349921	Because I thought it was interesting because leading into that, Reggie just showed why he was Reggie.
4350401	4353642	And he said something, and Bobby, maybe you can help fill me in here.
4353962	4354662	He said something like,
4355242	4359724	Well, you want to see the same old stuff again, but you want to see innovation.
4360645	4363126	He goes kind of like, conflict?
4363346	4364447	Fine, we can handle that.
4364527	4365467	That's our industry.
4365547	4366088	Here you go.
4366568	4367868	We're fucking Nintendo.
4369149	4369930	Suck it down.
4371030	4372371	Yes, let's see innovation.
4372391	4373151	And you will like it.
4374132	4375953	Let's talk innovation, Nintendo.
4376553	4377233	Let's start off.
4377393	4380035	Innovation is deeper and wider.
4380455	4381375	That's what she said.
4382436	4383597	Wah, wah.
4383697	4384177	No, um...
4386044	4387365	Let's talk innovation here, Nintendo.
4387685	4388426	Animal Crossing.
4389667	4391789	Now you can sit on park benches and go swimming.
4392309	4393850	It's the same fucking game still!
4394431	4395392	Same damn game.
4395492	4396412	Same everything.
4396432	4397533	There's the same patterns.
4397613	4398674	I even saw the screenshots.
4398914	4406260	The same fucking patterns that have been in that game since it first came out on the goddamn GameCube are in this stupid game.
4406340	4407261	Actually, it came out on Nintendo 64.
4407301	4407401	Yeah.
4408562	4412203	I understand that, but over here... For God's sakes, it's fucking Animal Crossing.
4412363	4413544	Who cares?
4413724	4414804	I care, because you know what?
4414824	4419026	They get away with this shit with every goddamn franchise that they have, because their fans love it.
4419266	4419746	You know what?
4420186	4421027	Fucking Smash Bros.
4421047	4421587	is coming out.
4421787	4424408	I bet you it's going to be all the fucking same characters again.
4424508	4427909	Fuck, they're just going to port that shit from the Wii, is what's going to end up happening.
4428229	4429690	But that's what makes it a franchise.
4429950	4430590	Dark Sakura.
4430810	4431971	I want it.
4432891	4433871	I want the Smash Brothers 2.
4433911	4435732	No, no, I meant Animal Crossing.
4436112	4440413	I was officially going to start playing my GBA one again.
4440433	4443234	Then I have to ask you, as a follow-up, why?
4443954	4445455	Because I watched the anime last night.
4445475	4446695	The other night.
4447195	4450476	And it was super cute, and I was like, I remember this in the game.
4450876	4452157	I remember that in the game.
4452577	4453417	I miss playing it.
4453457	4454257	You can ask Dan.
4454317	4455418	He was here the whole time.
4455798	4459219	As soon as they took out Unlockable Nest games, fuck that franchise.
4459499	4460139	Bobby, do you...
4461055	4465196	Do you think it's odd that they left Animal Crossing and Paper Mario out of the conference totally?
4465256	4466836	Well, except for, I guess, logos at the end?
4469957	4475278	I think that they felt they had enough that they were showing that, you know, they didn't keep you.
4475298	4479178	What I was actually surprised at is that there were no live demos of games.
4480059	4483779	They didn't bring those two out to show people.
4485019	4487960	I wonder if that, is that maybe because of the whole 3D, 2D thing?
4489540	4491582	No, no, I'm talking about the Wii U. Oh, excuse me.
4491622	4492442	I moved on already.
4492522	4493163	Oh, sorry, sorry.
4493223	4494464	But they didn't bring it out.
4494904	4495925	They showed videos.
4496545	4498287	But I'm like, is it even here?
4498407	4500848	Because I'm seeing all these conceptual videos and stuff.
4500889	4502590	I didn't even think it was even at E3.
4503250	4505972	Because usually they would have brought it out or something.
4506012	4508114	Tethered to lovely looking ladies, right?
4509878	4511880	Let me get to some of the feedback from our chatroom on the 3DS.
4511900	4515402	No, we'll move into Wii U. For the non-3DS owners, are you interested in a 3DS now?
4516143	4519845	Geovidea says, no, can't use the 3D on the 3DS anyway.
4520165	4521606	Burr says, still not interested.
4521886	4523107	Dungeon Buster, not really.
4524168	4526890	Blender, not interested in the 3DS at all.
4527590	4529972	So there's some of the negatives, but then we get some other positives.
4530732	4531973	Dartesia, oh, definitely.
4532053	4533094	New Mario Kart looks neat.
4533214	4535135	Yay, Tanooki suit.
4535996	4539238	Was Tanooki suit in Mario Kart, or is he just blurring the other Mario games?
4539298	4539598	All right.
4539618	4541799	Defective Candy says, Interesting, because there's not a lot of yeses.
4562466	4572070	And here's the thing about Star Fox, that he was talking about fucking innovation, how you can tilt it to, you can optionally, I guess, tilt it to control your ship.
4572410	4575972	Yeah, except it fucks up the 3D when you do that, dumbass.
4576272	4576952	Oh, no kidding.
4577252	4583195	Let's put tilt controls on a 3D game that requires you to keep the system at an actual view so that you can see the 3D.
4586095	4588136	I guess that's for people that don't give a shit about 3D.
4588156	4591017	But then again, why the fuck are you buying a 3DS sim?
4591518	4595099	Or better yet, why the fuck are you buying a game that came out on the Nintendo 64?
4595419	4597460	Oh, because that's an innovation for Nintendo.
4597640	4599901	We can port old shit and make it slightly better.
4600562	4601822	Bobby wants to jump in.
4603903	4607445	Well, I mean, I have a 3DS because it's a higher resolution top screen.
4608492	4626999	for me as well I bought a 3DS because I skipped the DSi and I skipped the DSi XL and the last one I had owned was a DS Lite so I thought it's time for upgrade why not that's why I did it but anyway let's move on to Wii U because I know Bobby wants to move on let me throw a question out to chat that we'll get to in a minute
4627459	4654647	and then I want to talk Bobby your time with the hands-on Wii U on a scale of 1 to 10 chatters 10 being very and 1 being not at all I'm sounding like a club Nintendo survey but I'm just kind of curious here 1 being not at all how interested are you in Wii U scale of 1 to 10 1 not at all 10 very Bobby you got your hands on it after 4 hours of waiting right what do you think
4656533	4659274	First off, what I want to say is I want to give a history lesson.
4660174	4668516	Back in 2005, at Nintendo's press conference, they decided that they were going to show this brand new revolutionary control scheme.
4669477	4679899	And they showed the remote, and they did, you know, that was when, you know, Miyamoto came out, slashing Zelda doors and all that stuff.
4680339	4685841	And they showed it, and when you played the games, you realized they were running on GameCubes.
4686187	4689769	and that's where the whole joke of two GameCubes duct taped together came from.
4690230	4694873	In 2006, they actually showed the console that the controller was for.
4695713	4704199	Fast forward to 2011, they are showing the controller for their next console, but they're not telling you that much about the console itself.
4704219	4706981	They're focusing on the input mechanism.
4707641	4710963	Next year, we're actually going to see more of the console.
4711023	4714846	Now, the demos that they're showing here are running on new hardware,
4715802	4722025	But, it's not, they even show a box there, but I was actually told that's not running anything.
4722065	4723706	It's like running a, there's a PC back there.
4724266	4726588	Running a, you know, a souped up wheat weed dev kit.
4727048	4728669	And that's what they're running things off of.
4728729	4731230	So, they're not ready to talk about the console yet.
4731250	4736993	They're trying to get people to concentrate on the controller and the conceptual demos.
4737053	4739254	There is not a single retail game
4739724	4748687	being shown, except, well, okay, there's one retail game, and it's a third-party game that's being shown here at E3 for the Wii U, so I kind of wanted to straighten that out.
4748827	4749928	Which one is that, the Lego game?
4751588	4751788	Huh?
4752169	4754189	Which, which, what's the third-party game, the Lego game?
4755690	4757570	Uh, no, they're showing Ghost Recon Online.
4757871	4758831	Oh, wow, okay.
4759400	4760561	You know what though, Bobby?
4760581	4765843	You're wrong because those are going to be an actual game because that's what Wii Sports and Wii Play ended up being.
4766063	4768525	It's all those tech demos and they've had, hey, you know what?
4768545	4769365	We're going to be innovative.
4769605	4777269	We're going to slap that shit together, kind of duct tape it a little bit and throw it out with a controller because people are suckers and they want free controllers.
4777389	4783653	But Bobby, that should make Bobby happy because that Chase Me is basically Pac-Man vs. Pac-Man vs. is awesome.
4784593	4786174	And what I'm saying is like,
4786536	4790818	People are, you know, when people look at these stuff, they're going to be like, wow, they're going to make me pay $50 for Chase Me.
4790898	4793039	No, they're not going to make you pay $50 for Chase Me.
4793379	4798601	They're going to make you pay $50 for Chase Me, Battle Me, and all that other stuff.
4798641	4803963	But, I mean, they were very adamant with me when I talked to people that actually worked at Nintendo and weren't just hired for the week.
4804943	4810486	Which you could tell, by the way, because the people that worked at Nintendo have QR codes of their knees on their badge that you could scan.
4812126	4816008	But they actually were very adamant saying, these are conceptual demos.
4817237	4819197	These are not final products.
4819298	4825879	These are to get your mind working and trying to tell you this is the type of stuff you can do.
4826339	4837561	Yes, we may see the Shield Pose game and Chase Me and Battle Me in some kind of compilation, but not as standalone games.
4837581	4843323	The only standalone games, like they had the Mario game running there and then Ghost Recon Online running.
4844063	4845503	But the rest were tech demos.
4847075	4852837	Just so you guys know, the feedback on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very, 1 being not at all, how interested are you in the Wii U?
4853857	4856118	I see lots of, it's just all over the board.
4856238	4858479	There's some nines, but there's also some ones.
4858779	4860120	There's a zero from Jovidea.
4860580	4861940	A lot of fives and fours.
4862680	4863501	And then like a six.
4863841	4865901	So there's a universal meh.
4866722	4867242	It's all over.
4867302	4871303	And that's because it's all conceptual right now.
4871343	4873384	People aren't seeing final products right now.
4874039	4876241	and, you know, even the hardware isn't finalized.
4876301	4881444	And so, and they didn't really emphasize enough that, you know, this is a new console.
4881484	4886068	You could actually walk away there and, I mean, even I thought this is just a new controller for my Wii.
4887108	4892552	And, you know, right now they've, you know, right now you're playing some of the games with Wii Remote.
4892972	4899777	It's got a Wii sensor bar underneath each TV, even though there's a sensor bar in the Wii Wii Wii controller.
4901258	4901899	But, it's
4902552	4904813	Essentially, I beat this out of them.
4905694	4909876	The console is called the Wii U, and they haven't named the controller yet.
4912257	4913638	I want to name it Bob.
4916419	4916799	Yeah, Dan?
4917099	4917920	I just wonder this.
4918100	4920741	Are we ready for the era of the game controller to cost $100 plus?
4922503	4927944	I don't think it will because that touchscreen is not, it's the DS touchscreen.
4928004	4929645	I called it on Sunday's show in some regards.
4929665	4930785	But it's a six and a half.
4930925	4931485	It's larger.
4933845	4935186	It's a lot larger.
4935546	4935866	I don't know.
4935886	4936886	79 maybe.
4936986	4939147	It's larger, but it's not multi-touch.
4940387	4941367	So that's one big thing.
4941707	4942927	Go ahead.
4943768	4943968	Yeah?
4944568	4944828	Go ahead.
4944968	4945408	Finish your thought.
4945428	4945608	Sorry.
4948252	4950834	It didn't seem to be like I couldn't do any multi-touch stuff.
4950854	4957441	Maybe their current demos don't have multi-touch, but yeah, it's just a larger version of the DSi screen.
4958542	4963687	Bobby, were there any demos that were using more than one of those controllers on the same system?
4963707	4965308	Because that was something I noticed at the conference.
4965388	4967430	None of the games were using more than one of those controllers.
4967751	4969953	Everything was supplemented with additional Wiimotes.
4972523	4974945	I didn't get a good look at Battle.me.
4975025	4985712	That was the only one that might have, but everything else it was either, you know, it was a one-player experience or, you know, it was one person using that and then four Wii remotes.
4986313	4986473	Hmm.
4987608	4995776	I think I watched a video of Battle.me on Nintendo's website and I want to say the person flying the spaceship was using the controller and everybody else was on a Wiimote.
4995816	4999620	So no, if the videos are to be the definitive answer.
4999980	5000981	I thought that was interesting.
5001362	5009209	Like maybe the price of the controller really isn't going to be such an issue because they aren't really going to have you or want you to have more than one.
5009770	5011592	Maybe the games aren't really going to need more than one.
5011832	5012732	That's baloney.
5012752	5016494	That sounds to me like just the whole thing with the GBA connector.
5016974	5017675	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
5017695	5018575	It's the same theory.
5018615	5020136	Why don't they just make a connector for the DS?
5021296	5022357	Here's the thing.
5024058	5028479	The controller is not creating any graphics, and I think that might be why.
5028880	5040805	They're actually, the graphics on the controller is being created by the Wii U, and it's being sent wirelessly with very little lag to the controller.
5042717	5043317	That makes sense.
5043578	5047840	And that's some technology you can see right now in the PS3 and the PSP.
5048540	5050661	You can log into your PS3 on your PSP.
5050922	5059046	It's a very little advertised feature, but you can fire up your PSP and log into your PS3 and see the image on your PSP, and it does work.
5059706	5066950	And, you know, remember back when Kasarai was first showing Ridge Racer, the original concept was that that PSP was supposed to be your rearview mirror.
5067210	5071773	We never saw that really fully realized, but the idea was out there a while ago.
5072485	5075107	If no one minds, actually, if I go back to an old point.
5075387	5075567	Sure.
5075807	5077728	Because she just made the point to me.
5078048	5078228	Sure.
5079809	5087653	Ciara has said that as a person who bought around eight different versions of Final Fantasy VII, I don't care if it's the same game.
5088514	5089915	Talk about back to the Animal Crossing thing.
5090675	5092136	The fans will buy it if they like it.
5092916	5094437	So that's why it stays the same.
5094477	5097879	Then the fans can't complain when they say, oh, well, it's just the same game.
5097919	5098759	They didn't do anything.
5098840	5100040	Four, not seven.
5100620	5100841	Okay.
5102341	5112624	Bobby, you're in a unique position that none of us and probably most of our chatters and even listeners are in tonight where you're the only one that's actually held one of these Wii U's.
5113085	5116426	So coming out of there, how are you?
5116446	5125769	Because I know you said at the end of the press conference you were feeling a little mint, but coming out of the demo, are you thinking you're going to buy a Wii U or are you kind of like, I need to see more next year?
5128549	5130130	I want to hand Nintendo my wallet.
5131335	5132416	and just say, here, take it.
5133316	5136778	And what was it about it that just made you go, I'm sold?
5137239	5151848	Well, I can see kind of more, you know, I can actually contextualize a lot more and I can see where they're going with it and a lot of the neat stuff that they're doing and the neat gameplay that they're doing with that and what they can do.
5151928	5155610	I can kind of see where they're going with it, which a lot of people usually can't.
5155630	5159232	Like, when they first announced the DS, everybody's like, why would I want a touchscreen on my games?
5160459	5163941	and now, you know, what's, you know, iPhone games are really popular.
5165282	5171006	So, you know, and I could see where that was going and nobody else could figure out why would I want a touchscreen gaming system.
5171847	5176650	I actually saw when I first saw the DS, here's why you'd want a touchscreen gaming system.
5176690	5179152	I could actually see it and it's true, you know.
5179612	5182154	And a lot of people are like, oh, this is a gimmick and all that stuff.
5182914	5187517	And a lot of Nintendo's innovations have been copied by everybody else and they were called gimmicks at first.
5187557	5190059	You know, like Rumble was a gimmick.
5190959	5196045	and now we have touch screens on everything, motion controls are on everything.
5197626	5209439	I think that Nintendo is going to innovate in this space and you're going to see in a couple years other companies copying them and it's not the first time they've done this because they've already done the GameCube, Game Boy Advance thing.
5210020	5212943	So they've already got a track record of some of the stuff they already know.
5213203	5214043	Holiday 2012 It'll be Holiday 2012
5237423	5242906	Just from being in retail, Nintendo always saves the machines for Christmas.
5242946	5243967	But not the 3DS?
5244247	5245768	No, no, not the portables.
5245808	5247429	The consoles.
5247449	5250250	This is something from one of those guys that has the QR code on his badge.
5251451	5251931	Oh, okay.
5252471	5253532	So that's the official word then.
5253552	5258855	Bobby, what did you think about the Analog 6 being above the actual D-pad and the face buttons?
5258895	5261456	That's a little backwards compared to the controllers now.
5261516	5262237	3DS is that way.
5262357	5263277	It felt natural.
5264438	5264658	All right.
5266296	5277750	Because of where the triggers are, there's the triggers and then the LB and the RB, but because of where they are, that is the exact position your thumb would really want to be if you wanted to use the dual analog sticks.
5278925	5285609	Bobby, if I'm not mistaken, you were kind of in this wee line yourself and doing this whole thing, kind of going in there by yourself.
5285669	5296536	Now, I know, when I'm in a big environment like that by myself, because I did E3 myself one year, or at least one of the days, and one of the things that I couldn't help but do was listen to other people around me and do a little bit of people watching.
5296576	5297737	Yes, I was being a little nosy.
5298077	5302960	Were you doing any of that, maybe in the Nintendo booth and kind of picking up some of the buzz from people around you?
5305742	5308244	Not really, because everybody around me spoke different languages.
5310452	5310952	Touche.
5310972	5311573	Touche.
5333373	5334333	The controller is actually lighter.
5334353	5335254	It's about the same as my iPad.
5335334	5337695	If I don't have a cover on it, it feels about the same weight as my iPad does.
5337735	5338475	And how did it feel?
5338495	5338735	And as for...
5358780	5365682	It felt natural, like, I mean, you'd think it's big, but then you hold it, and, you know, I mean, I have normal-sized hands, and it felt fine.
5366042	5370823	Because you're not reaching all the way down to the bottom, like, all the buttons are easily accessible.
5371843	5382106	You know, it's, you know, yeah, it's also, I mean, it's also a prototype controller as well, it could change at the end, and it was also, like, tied down, like, four different ways, so you couldn't take it.
5382526	5385107	So that probably added to the weight as well.
5386134	5387855	But no, it felt natural.
5387935	5388875	It was lighter than I expected.
5388955	5391236	Well, it was wired when I played it.
5406763	5428876	ah so maybe it's feeding well no because they they showed in the other concept videos it's going to be wireless and they talked about beaming the image wirelessly but it's too early it's early on the proto pictures I've seen online look like they have a charge port on them I want to know what this parrot has to do with anything Bobby what I'm sorry but you were gonna say something we were cutting you off
5430550	5432231	No, it's wired here.
5432271	5433472	It's a prototype.
5433692	5435613	Things change.
5436173	5441856	The 3DS didn't really change all that much, but I remember the original DS was different when it came out.
5441876	5443017	This is a prototype thing.
5443097	5444418	It could change its layout.
5444918	5448120	I don't even think they know what the tech specs are going to be in the final product.
5449332	5450332	How is it ergonomically?
5450392	5451253	Like I said, when I held it
5476689	5479370	My fingers went to all the right places.
5480050	5488912	On the back, which you don't get to feel that much, there is actual grooves for you to hold with your three fingers that aren't playing with the triggers.
5490812	5494753	It felt good.
5495533	5498154	I picked it up and my hands were in the right place.
5498554	5499214	It didn't hurt.
5499975	5501817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5520700	5526864	On the back, it's got curves on the back for you to hold on to and for your fingers to naturally curve around.
5526884	5530326	See, I was thinking the same logic, though, with the Saturn dual analog controller on the front.
5530366	5533428	It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable, but it's one of the most comfortable controllers there are.
5533768	5533948	Yeah.
5534368	5536750	So, yeah, I was wondering if it was along the same lines.
5538018	5542062	I had an appointment with EA Sports, so I got to play the pre-alpha build of the new SSX.
5542122	5545184	And I can see that people who like SSX are really going to like this.
5564413	5570014	They've talked about how they've got this snow avalanche system that is dynamic.
5570254	5576396	It's not like split-second or anything that has these predetermined catastrophic events.
5576816	5590179	They actually say that they take the stability of the area, how stable it is, to see if that actually affects more snow or stops the snow, and that's one of the modes where you're trying to survive.
5590952	5591633	Not die.
5591753	5594474	You're trying to get down this mountain without getting crushed by snow.
5595135	5596435	It's very uplifting.
5597456	5602119	But, you know, they did basically Google Earth.
5602559	5603099	It was kind of funny.
5603420	5607402	They licensed with NASA topography data of the entire world.
5608262	5610964	And they said it's nice to have friends in high places.
5611024	5611745	That was their pun.
5612645	5617488	And they had all the major mountain ranges, and you can pick those mountains.
5618291	5621794	to go down, and it's the actual mountains from the actual NASA topography data.
5622614	5624515	And those are the mountains that you go down.
5625056	5636164	And they've done some things with it, like one of the mountains that's on the China border, they decided they were going to put pieces of the Great Wall of China in there that you could grind off of and stuff, so it's not completely realistic.
5636604	5639246	But it's still, it's a lot more than they've done in the past.
5640227	5641708	But it worked well.
5641828	5645030	I mean, it's not a final build by any means.
5645090	5647812	There was some lag in it, but I mean, that's because it's a pre-alpha build.
5648374	5676003	so basically I saw that and they showed me some stuff about FIFA which I'm not a huge soccer fan but it was kind of neat some of the stuff they did so I saw that and then I walked through Microsoft's booth to see what was kind of in there and I'm going to go play that Disneyland Connect game because I know where I'm going Friday and Friday is a research trip Friday is a research trip
5677383	5677523	Yes.
5677743	5678343	Yes.
5678383	5686887	But apparently in the demo, like I guess in the briefing, because I didn't see the briefing, I was in the air, but apparently I guess it cuts off at the end of the Peter Pan ride.
5686907	5687427	Uh-huh.
5689928	5690408	In the presser?
5691228	5692148	I think so, yeah.
5692249	5693789	I just thought it was a time thing, yeah.
5695010	5695190	Yeah.
5695550	5696490	Well, it cuts off.
5696710	5698651	Apparently you do actually fight Captain Hook.
5699720	5700901	Now they showed that a little bit.
5701341	5702021	Huh, interesting.
5702461	5703562	Maybe it was in a video or something.
5703602	5703862	All right.
5704962	5705322	What else?
5705702	5709424	There was that, and then I walked by and I immediately thought of Rob.
5709764	5710044	Oh dear.
5710624	5716567	Because there were these four chicks wearing black dresses up on a stage doing the time warp.
5717907	5718868	From the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
5718888	5720108	And I just had to get pictures.
5720368	5723249	And so this means they're doing a Rocky Horror Picture Show video game?
5723529	5724430	Yay!
5724690	5725010	Yes!
5725768	5754194	yes, it is called Glee Karaoke Revolution 2 no you've mentioned the four letter G word therefore I must go I even took video for you oh wait, here we go you mentioned the four letter G word now I must go throw up yes, and I did get the picture thank you Bobby did you get some hands on time with anything else?
5757589	5770132	Not really, I mean, I did, I stopped by, I have a friend who works at Double Fine, and I walked by and played Trenched, which is their Xbox Live arcade game, which is a third-person mech tower defense game.
5770872	5771832	Hmm, interesting.
5771852	5780554	Where you're fighting waves and waves of enemies, and you can drop turrets and different things like a tower defense game, but then you're also in this mech shooting at them.
5781303	5782384	and running around and stuff.
5783204	5788366	It was two player online because I was playing with the person standing next to me on his console.
5791248	5797310	Unfortunately, this demo, they dropped you at a mission that's like in the last third of the game.
5797430	5800532	You've already gone through the tutorial by this point and all that stuff.
5800992	5805454	And it was a little confusing because I haven't really done much with the game.
5805974	5808856	But I can see people liking it.
5809356	5809456	It's
5809964	5812806	Not over the top like you'd expect from Kim Schafer, though.
5814186	5815647	So what's on deck for you tomorrow?
5816148	5817108	What are your plans?
5817448	5820970	And I know we mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'm sure you want to talk about your Twitter project.
5822751	5822931	Right.
5822991	5824592	I have two appointments tomorrow.
5825093	5826954	And other than that, I'm letting people direct me.
5829015	5836339	My two appointments, just so people kind of know, at 1 o'clock I'm going to visit a Georgia company because being in Georgia, I actually have contacts there.
5836903	5842928	I'm going to go to CCP Games where they just announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
5842948	5852095	And they're actually going to show the connectivity between Dust 514 on the PlayStation 3 and EVE Online, the Excel spreadsheet simulator on the PC.
5852975	5857239	I'm very curious about that because we missed that with so much coming out of Sony.
5857899	5862443	But yeah, I'm very interested in this whole how does this game impact the MMO of EVE Online.
5862483	5862963	Very interested.
5864656	5868959	Yeah, and I am too because I have played EVE a little bit so I actually understand the universe and stuff.
5868979	5870080	So I'm going to go in there and see them.
5870560	5877004	And then at 4 o'clock I do have a Bethesda appointment where I'm going to get to see the demo of Skyrim that everybody else has seen already.
5878005	5879106	Yeah, I guess it was on TV.
5879466	5882808	I think we saw a portion of what will be a longer demo for you.
5882868	5884769	I heard it's a 30-minute demo behind the doors.
5884970	5886991	So very curious about that.
5887071	5887511	So good.
5887551	5890073	Those are two games we can definitely talk more about tomorrow.
5891094	5892795	And so if folks want to follow you on Twitter...
5894875	5906684	Bobby Blackwolf and tomorrow also I'm going to be trying to hit Atlas so if you have any specific questions about Catherine or any of other Atlas' games I'm probably going to hit them after the CCP because they're next door.
5907044	5908125	And our Chibi Wolf picture?
5910334	5939714	I'm going to go try to find Natsume and get your Chibi Wolf picture Need to go play Saints Row 3 I need my cow Actually, the one thing not to load you up with assignments, Bobby maybe you already know the answers to a couple of these but there's two things that are kind of missing right now where I'm like, what happened to... One of them is Grand Theft Auto V Everybody was convinced Grand Theft Auto V was debuting at E3 and we have heard nothing It's gone, it's not there, right?
5941569	5942372	I have not seen it.
5943476	5947230	And then the other big question mark is what the hell is Activision doing?
5950000	5950921	Yeah, they've got a booth.
5951041	5951982	I'll go stop by them.
5952002	5955104	But I think they're doing this little game that's called Modern Warfare 3.
5955565	5956666	Oh, yeah, all right.
5956786	5957626	Don't know if you've heard of it.
5958327	5966373	Well, but still, when Activision's a huge company like EA, and EA, I could name easily like 10 games EA, we know they're doing.
5966714	5968956	Activision's got maybe a couple.
5969436	5971177	No, they have more than that.
5971197	5973059	Yeah, but where's the Bungie game?
5973239	5976121	I just thought there'd be more coming out from Activision.
5976141	5977503	Maybe because of the lack of press conference.
5977543	5977883	I don't know.
5979625	5980586	Any music games?
5980606	5981728	Yeah, they've scaled back.
5983290	5983891	Very interesting.
5983931	5990620	Yeah, it's Modern Warfare 3 for them, X-Men Destiny, Spider-Man, whatever the... Spyro.
5992438	5997682	Well, the Activision, if I'm not mistaken, was also... Spyro, Cha-Ching, Skylanders is what that's called.
5997702	5999704	It's basically, hey, guess what?
6000284	6010792	We're going to charge you $70 for the starter kit, and then if you want your individual, you know, collect-them-all figurines that you can use for playable characters in the game, those are each going to cost you $8.
6011993	6018195	If I'm not mistaking, wasn't Activision also at one time the company that said, we're just not doing E3 anymore?
6018375	6020676	Yeah, exactly.
6020716	6026717	Their big title now is so big that they're just like, we don't need E3 really.
6026817	6030278	If they're going to do a show, we'll make an appearance, but we don't want to spend the money or the time.
6030298	6036840	Then I hope Battlefield 3 blows the shit out of them because that game looks nice.
6037120	6058239	everybody wants to see Activision put in their place everybody wants to see Activision I just watched like a mission there was like a tank mission or whatever that they're showing with Battlefield 3 it's just amazing I mean Call of Duty it's pretty action packed it's an ultra realistic looking war game wow another one it looks way better though they all look great but I mean it's just like
6060160	6061421	Awesome!
6061561	6064764	We gotta let Bobby go find some... No, no, hang on.
6065044	6067006	I gotta respond to something in here in chat.
6067026	6072811	Kaijudo says the reason why there isn't a GTA 5 is because Agent is coming out for GTA 5.
6072871	6078195	Now, I can't remember who exactly I heard this from, but it was from somebody I trust.
6078836	6085061	Apparently they heard somebody ask, I think it was Jack Trenton, is Agent still a PS3 exclusive?
6085101	6088344	And his response was, you'll have to ask Rockstar about that.
6089639	6090460	Hmm.
6091461	6092042	Interesting.
6094085	6096729	Bobby, we got to let you go find some good beer in LA.
6097590	6103277	But before we do, I can't imagine anyone that listens to Orange Lounge Radio doesn't already know about your show.
6103337	6107163	But just in case there's like the one person that doesn't, tell us a little bit about your show.
6109451	6110312	I'm the opening band.
6111292	6111692	Stop.
6112072	6114133	And I am on at 8 p.m.
6114193	6114834	Eastern, 5 p.m.
6114874	6116534	Pacific, right before Orange Launch Radio.
6116734	6122677	It's me talking for about 30 minutes, and then I take calls, and everybody tells me I'm wrong for the next 20 minutes.
6123097	6127119	And then I goof off with Rob and DarkSakura for 10 minutes, and that's my show.
6127399	6128960	That is high entertainment.
6129440	6136143	All Games Radio is where it's live, or bobbyblackwolf.com is the website where I've almost, you know, I'm not as old as they all are,
6136901	6139023	But I'm coming upon six years next month.
6139223	6140464	That's still very impressive.
6140764	6141345	Very impressive.
6141505	6142426	You're still a big boy.
6143807	6145068	You can sit at the big kids table.
6145528	6145768	All right.
6145968	6151693	Well, Bobby, we'll be talking to you again tomorrow and have a lot of fun at E3 tomorrow and just play as many games as you can, all right?
6153474	6153814	I will.
6153874	6156096	And Thursday also is wide open.
6156116	6157918	I don't have any appointments on that day.
6158438	6161400	So, you know, if I don't get through it tomorrow, I want to get through it Thursday.
6161420	6162201	And I want to say...
6162959	6168944	because some people don't believe me when I say this and they started asking me, go ask Microsoft if they're going to charge for Skype.
6168984	6171646	I'm like, no, I can't because I don't have that kind of access.
6171987	6173027	Right, right, exactly.
6173047	6179272	Try to keep your questions to games that maybe aren't AAA titles or from AAA developers.
6180373	6183196	I want to find, you know, like this year's Scribblenauts.
6183756	6189681	Scribblenauts I had never heard of until I saw it in the back corner of WB's booth a couple years ago and it blew me away.
6190103	6196888	Katamari Damacy I really hadn't heard of until Namco showed it off a couple years ago at E3, or many years ago at E3 now.
6197809	6208477	So I'm looking for those games, and if you hear something that maybe you want to hear more about that GameSpot and IGN at the big sites aren't going to cover, those are the games I want to find.
6208998	6211820	I'm not going to be able to ask Peter Molyneux about Fable the 30.
6211900	6218685	I'm not going to be able to ask Sony about if they're going to be doing this or that with the Vita, because they're not going to talk to me.
6219065	6219926	But the smaller desks,
6220424	6221653	They will answer my question.
6221955	6223163	And those are the people I want to talk to.
6223672	6225474	All right, Internet, you have your homework assignment.
6225494	6227175	Twitter.com slash BobbyBlackWolf.
6227195	6232699	And I just want to clarify, even though Bobby will still be at the show Thursday, we will not be having an E3 special Thursday.
6233080	6239385	Anything Bobby does on Thursday, he will be doing on his own show this upcoming Sunday when he broadcasts live.
6239985	6242467	And we will not be here live on Sunday.
6242808	6244189	It's all weird, this programming thing.
6244229	6245470	I'm just going to have to draw a grid.
6245590	6249613	But follow our websites and stay tuned for all the information in our Twitters.
6249894	6251395	That's how you can stay on top of the world.
6252313	6260836	and on my show Sunday night I will actually talk about the actual demos of the Wii Wii Wii Wii Wii Wii that I played and how each of them felt and played and all that stuff.
6261196	6262416	Alright, sounds good.
6263637	6270439	Alright, well Bobby we're going to let you go so we can get to some other calls and I've got to call Shane too who's also there waiting to talk to us.
6270779	6271659	So take care buddy.
6273180	6276120	Yeah, I get to go watch Nerds riding a mechanical bull now.
6276200	6276841	It's going to be great.
6277121	6277841	Awesome, have fun.
6279218	6281100	Thank you Thank you
6302944	6303444	That was pretty fun.
6329156	6333843	Well, I've been going on Twitter and seeing random, this is bullshit!
6334063	6334844	Wii U what?
6335605	6338108	So my Twitter's been a source of hilarity.
6338889	6339590	Dan, what about you?
6339831	6341453	I've been streaming all the press conferences.
6341553	6341813	Yeah?
6342334	6342574	Yeah.
6343015	6345699	And I've been going to the game sites and...
6347052	6374764	just experiencing it as much as you can from the comfort of your computer chair that's right and where the food is reasonable we should be there I know we failed next year next year alright let me ask this question too Loki I know you've had some hands on with this some of the stuff that's been released during E3 we've had a few not just Connect Labs was it's out today but there was also Excitebike 3D came out did you get a chance to grab the Excitebike 3D on 3DS
6375484	6376685	I did, and I checked it out.
6376745	6383411	I'm glad that it wasn't just them kind of offsetting each individual sprite layer.
6384011	6387454	But, I mean, it still wasn't that great.
6387474	6394460	It was like watching Excitebike on a really tiny screen, because when you do it in 3D, it's just really tiny.
6394640	6395461	Do you have that here with you?
6396162	6396682	I don't.
6397123	6397423	Damn it.
6397663	6399344	Do you have it, Rob?
6399384	6400085	Yes, I do, actually.
6400565	6401126	Give to daddy.
6402532	6402732	Let's go!
6426255	6427476	It's just too expensive.
6427516	6429778	They probably will before too long, so here you go.
6429798	6430718	I'm going to give that to Dan.
6430778	6432880	He can check that out right now.
6434161	6441486	I do like how when you use the 3D slider on it, how it zooms it back into the original game, which is kind of neat.
6441987	6448171	But, I mean, beyond that gimmick, I just can't get too excited about it, you know what I mean?
6448351	6450733	It's just... I don't know.
6450793	6453035	It's as exciting as Excitebike is, I guess.
6454876	6461940	Alright, well we are going to give Miklatov a call and ask some more questions about Nintendo.
6461980	6463240	We're going to hear another perspective.
6463981	6467542	And I don't know if, I don't think he got hands on with Wii U today.
6468083	6471864	But he was, he was there at the Nintendo presser.
6472665	6474966	And Dan's like, this is widescreen, what's going on?
6474986	6477327	Alright, we're going to give Miklatov a call.
6477347	6480629	I just punched in the digits, one ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.
6481730	6481930	Hello?
6481950	6482070	Hello?
6482090	6482470	Hello?
6512180	6514641	Microsoft bored me to tears.
6515842	6516602	Why is that?
6516662	6519264	Because they didn't have anything interesting.
6519284	6528148	They were all, here's the Kinect that we've been pushing for a year and we're trying to keep it relevant.
6528608	6536252	And by the way, here's Gears of War with probably a drunk or high iced tea.
6536432	6537552	That's why he was angry.
6537632	6539553	He wasn't drunk yet and it was 11am.
6540694	6541174	There you go.
6543203	6546224	and really they had me with Band Central and that was it.
6546505	6548246	Nothing else was interesting to me.
6549386	6550007	And then Sony?
6551648	6552148	Sony?
6552788	6553709	I actually really liked.
6554849	6556110	I liked their monitor.
6557091	6564555	I didn't see it yet in action but I liked the idea of two people looking at it and seeing different things and it's cheap.
6566656	6569138	I liked the idea of the Vita.
6569578	6570498	I liked Uncharted 3.
6572383	6574884	talking about Pico and Shadow of the Cloth.
6575284	6576504	This also makes me happy.
6576584	6579305	So overall, they did really well in my eyes.
6580126	6580286	Yeah.
6580646	6581026	I really liked it.
6581046	6581546	I'd like to go again.
6581566	6581826	It was also...
6598519	6609487	Like, while I liked it, and I thought it was cool, like, they had the orchestra, and that was neat, and, oh, a golden remote was cool, I was also kind of dull, and it went by really fast.
6611451	6612392	Oh, they're really good.
6612412	6614773	No, no, I was seven rows from the front.
6614793	6614914	Yeah.
6614934	6617215	I don't remember them showing it off in person.
6617575	6619016	I didn't bring it off in person.
6619036	6619136	Yeah.
6619177	6619377	Yeah.
6640836	6643859	I know you haven't done hands-on, or did you do hands-on today, or no?
6644640	6659075	No, I went there first thing this morning, and of course all the visitors were in line first, that's what they do, and it looked like it was like a three and a half hour wait from where I was at, so I was like, screw it.
6659691	6660672	and I'm just going to do it tomorrow.
6660692	6665236	Yeah, that's why I decided to go and look at other things today because I knew that tomorrow and the next day would be mostly Vida and you.
6682071	6685232	Oh yeah, everything that they talked about today for the 3DS, I got to play.
6685273	6686953	So that was pretty cool.
6687053	6687974	I like that they had
6708806	6713748	They're titled at the press conference and they're like, oh yeah, and everything we're talking about, don't say it now.
6714308	6715889	Wait, so Kid Icarus was playable too?
6715909	6719030	Yeah, oh my god, I love Kid Icarus.
6719130	6721251	Wow, tell us a little bit about how that demo played.
6722512	6725373	Okay, so there were two, well, three demos.
6725613	6727234	I did two of the three so far.
6728074	6733757	The first demo is an aerial mission and a ground mission combined into one.
6735417	6737118	So with the aerial mission...
6737965	6750835	It's pretty much, if you played Sin Infinishment, you've got your little target that you control with the stylus, and then the circle pad is how you straight and move up and down.
6751015	6757000	And your firing is all based out of the left button at the top, the L button.
6759342	6764886	And before you actually do the mission, you actually had like, I think around nine...
6766295	6768336	options for what you want to use as your weapon.
6768856	6771117	So that was pretty neat.
6771218	6774999	I went with Pan Blast because I thought that was cool.
6775820	6789166	So when you're playing, if you target an enemy with the target, I don't know how to pronounce it, it'll lock onto them, kind of.
6789787	6794189	If you hold down the L button, it'll shoot a rapid succession of shots.
6795026	6803908	If you just target them though and just single press it, you will deliver like a fully charged blast that can actually take out several enemies in that area.
6808628	6811049	I'm sorry, did you say the other one was the multiplayer demo?
6812949	6813809	There were two other ones.
6814329	6815509	There was a multiplayer demo.
6815549	6816710	I did not get to do that.
6818010	6818770	I don't know why.
6819470	6821130	I don't think I wanted to hang around at that point.
6822431	6824311	But the other one they had was AR cards.
6825395	6850870	which actually if you did the demonstration with them you got a pack so I have a pack of Kid Icarus AR cards once the game comes out they'll be able to use but all it really is is just putting characters on through the AR on the card and then they can battle each other it was that thing that some were joking like hey didn't we see this already when it was called the Eye of Judgment yes that's all it is
6852177	6853418	That's pretty much all there is.
6853578	6860101	Interesting that Nintendo just slaps Kid Icarus on it and now people are going crazy about it.
6860381	6861782	Isn't that funny how that works, Loki?
6862102	6865103	Loki, was the bet still on if a million copies of that game sell?
6865924	6866784	No, there is no bet.
6868105	6869525	It's done.
6869565	6870166	Get over it.
6870386	6870946	Alright, alright.
6871786	6872767	What else did you play on DS?
6873767	6873967	3DS.
6874067	6875708	I played Luigi's Mansion 2.
6876469	6876669	Hmm.
6878004	6902484	it played like Luigi's Mansion it was some big shocker there the one thing that I did not like is that I know it's early in development but the frame rate chugged even when you weren't doing much of anything okay well hopefully they get that ironed out I mean yeah that's an early development thing I'm sure but they'll have to fix that Mario Mario was cool um
6904525	6915387	It played like Mario Galaxy on the stages that didn't have the 3D worlds where you're running around the entire planet upside down and stuff like that.
6917808	6919528	Nothing much really different there.
6919568	6926090	You've got your raccoon suit back, but it looks like the Tanooki suit, but it has the raccoon suit powers, so it's kind of weird.
6926390	6926770	Interesting.
6928450	6929650	Let's see, Mario Kart.
6929970	6931411	Mario Kart was fantastic.
6933324	6935166	60 frames a second from what I was told.
6936587	6937588	Even in 3D?
6939529	6940190	Even in 3D?
6940650	6941911	Even in 3D it does 60 frames?
6942071	6942812	Wow.
6943212	6945514	Who would play it in 2D?
6945714	6947336	Losers would play it in 2D.
6947416	6953481	Well, I'm thinking of Dead or Alive Dimensions where they were saying, oh, it'll do 60 frames in 2D and 30 in 3D.
6953621	6957484	It was kind of split, so I was wondering if they were kind of doing... Yeah, same with Street Fighter.
6957784	6958305	Huh, okay.
6959385	6960566	Yeah, but no, this was 60 frames 3D
6962873	6966974	It was hard, which was amazing, because Mario Kart has not been hard in years.
6968515	6983880	The paint gliding mechanic, when you had the jumps, that was interesting because you either had to slow down in the air to collect coins, or you knocked to the ground as fast as you could to continue racing.
6984060	6985860	So it was a weird trade-off.
6987241	6988861	Interesting.
6989241	6990662	The propeller, when you're underwater,
6991932	6992332	Whatever.
6992492	6993193	That was stupid.
6993873	6994974	It did nothing for me.
6995294	6995934	And Star Fox?
6997255	6997755	Star Fox?
6997895	7000016	I don't know if it had a single player.
7000717	7007680	I played multiplayer, though, and it felt a lot like the multiplayer that was from the DS game, which I kind of like.
7008661	7009862	Just really nice-looking.
7011503	7016865	What was cool, though, is that out of our four-people battle, I totally killed everybody in one.
7017045	7017886	And the little...
7018447	7019047	Oh, how funny.
7019107	7019328	Oh, yeah.
7047156	7054239	You can see what they're looking at, like if they're going to look up in the upper corner or something, or if they make a weird face randomly.
7055119	7058160	It's continuously refreshing, but fairly slow.
7058300	7060261	So no picking your nose and playing Star Fox then?
7061582	7066183	You could, but it'd be hard because of the way you have to hold the system.
7067044	7068644	Alright, so that's cool.
7068684	7071245	So it sounds like you got your hands on at least a lot of the 3DS titles today.
7071265	7074127	What was your favorite out of the bunch?
7074247	7075187	Probably
7075797	7079559	A tie between Mario Kart and Kid Icarus.
7079860	7082681	Because I forgot to say Kid Icarus, beautiful.
7083622	7084422	Absolutely beautiful.
7084823	7089966	The water in that game, as Nintendo is known to do, just was amazing.
7090026	7090806	It blew me away.
7091507	7092727	One more 3DS question.
7092747	7099631	I'm not sure if you're aware, but Nintendo unloaded onto the eShop today trailers for Animal Crossing and Paper Mario as well.
7100412	7101933	Were those games anywhere to be seen?
7103174	7108017	Not that I saw because I really wanted to play at least Animal Crossing.
7108338	7116183	I did download the trailer though when I got back to the hotel room for Animal Crossing and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it or not.
7116283	7117964	Oh, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.
7118605	7118965	What's that?
7119145	7119646	It looks what?
7121787	7125270	I said it's got some really cool new features.
7126170	7129212	I'm not sure if you guys... Yeah, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.
7129232	7130754	Sitting on benches and swimming?
7131174	7131534	Awesome.
7132094	7132195	Yeah.
7132235	7132395	Yeah.
7133397	7134298	That's crazy.
7136119	7138001	Was your mind blown by swimming?
7138021	7140703	I was like, oh my god, I can sit down.
7140943	7144125	Wait, Mikulatov, did Animal Crossing have colored balloons?
7146067	7147688	No, no, it wasn't that cool.
7149209	7152472	Alright, what else did you do at the show today?
7152512	7156675	Since you didn't stand in line for the Vita all day like Bobby had to, what did you get your hands on today?
7158176	7161519	Well, I also want to quickly throw in that I played Zelda as well on the 3DS.
7162850	7165071	and it was fan-freaking-tastic.
7165111	7167733	That was a close call for my tie for best 3DS game I played.
7168233	7169894	Could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?
7170294	7171094	What made it so great?
7193126	7196727	I'm not sure I could say I was playing a 13-year-old game.
7198207	7202128	I will say that the graphics are definitely much nicer.
7204608	7206689	The frame rate is crazy nice.
7207669	7209589	The 3D effect, I didn't really care for.
7209849	7211349	It didn't really do anything for me.
7212050	7218591	I did like people switching to the slingshot or the hookshot would...
7219989	7226833	All right.
7227293	7228894	Well, what else did you get to play at the show today?
7230475	7230975	Let's see.
7231035	7236098	I firstly walked around, which is kind of, you know, a waste of a day.
7236719	7240701	I played the new Silent Hill game, both in 3D and in 2D.
7241301	7241782	Interesting.
7241822	7242262	What'd you think?
7244143	7245784	Crap, is what I think.
7247210	7253092	It was terrible in 3D and it was terrible in 3D, so this is definitely a pass for me.
7253192	7254973	I'm not even interested.
7255173	7256093	Why was it terrible?
7256153	7256894	What did it play like?
7256954	7259315	Was it more like the Wii Silent Hill, which I don't see?
7259355	7260655	Was it more like Alan Wake?
7260695	7261535	Was it Alan Wake?
7261575	7262056	What was it?
7263356	7264937	I wish it was like Alan Wake.
7264997	7265857	I know, I like Alan Wake.
7265997	7267478	Or even Shattered Memories.
7268418	7275881	It was like a generic survival horror that ran really choppy
7276873	7278394	Um, and was boring.
7279135	7280135	And not scary.
7280515	7287439	Like, at least in every other demo that I've played at E3 for a Silent Hill game, something has been kind of freaky about it.
7288260	7288800	Not this one.
7289220	7290241	It was just boring.
7291482	7293063	It's not Silent Hill if it's not freaky.
7294323	7294924	Exactly.
7295644	7298286	And it was just dull.
7298606	7305690	Like, oh, there was an enemy that jumped out and I think was supposed to scare me, but this more annoyed me because they aren't scary.
7305730	7305850	Yeah.
7306511	7313114	The only thing I ever saw for Tomb Raider wasn't on the floor It's during the Microsoft conference So I was over in Square Enix's booth for a bit today And I didn't see it anywhere
7332714	7336657	but I was also playing the entire demo for Final Fantasy XIII too.
7337258	7338118	Ooh, what'd you think of that?
7339720	7343763	I actually really like XIII despite what other people think.
7343803	7345184	So I like this one a lot.
7345664	7351289	They added some interesting features like a what's that called?
7351329	7358275	The real-time segments like God of War and Heavy Rain have.
7359376	7362298	Which was, you know, it's a little out of place but it was still neat
7362714	7363495	But no Dressphere.
7388134	7388975	No just fears.
7388995	7392116	I definitely don't know who the main character is that I was playing as.
7418018	7420078	Yeah, but there's a lot of Sonic stuff for their new Sonic game.
7420159	7423459	And it actually didn't look that bad.
7423559	7426060	I didn't get to play it though yet.
7426120	7426220	Hmm.
7444614	7447395	Alright, you'll have to let us know when you do finally get your hands on it.
7448155	7448435	What else?
7450135	7453336	There was this really neat Kinect game by Konami.
7454056	7457036	It was called Lead Me's, I believe.
7458497	7462097	It's both Kinect, and I believe it's a download title, they said.
7462597	7464818	But it plays a little bit like Lemmings.
7465678	7471899	So you stand in front of the Kinect sensor, and you become this wireframe character, pretty much.
7472492	7479816	and you have these little adorable things that fall down and you have to get them to safety by using your limbs as bridges, stuff like that.
7481117	7481737	Interesting.
7481817	7488320	So you use your body to build the path to get these guys safe, basically.
7488921	7489161	Yes.
7489561	7490041	Interesting.
7491762	7493883	I know you're a big fan of music games too.
7494464	7496545	Any music games that you saw besides Dance Central 2?
7498602	7505367	No, I saw DDR, but it's laughable nowadays, so it's not even worth talking about.
7506027	7508409	Aw, but I kind of wanted to know how laughable it was.
7511071	7524220	They had four licenses, I believe, in the Red Fork Nominee Originals, and what I watched looked like the character models looked like DDR PC quality, but not as awesome.
7524890	7526950	because there was no Mr. Spanky or anything like that.
7526970	7529771	They were just like really poorly done character models.
7529931	7531311	Nobody loves Mr. Spanky.
7531331	7533672	What was that?
7534072	7534452	Forget it.
7536432	7537032	Oh, okay.
7537132	7543293	I did not hear you because I'm hearing me talk every time I talk.
7543353	7544274	No Dance Masters 2?
7545934	7546814	No Dance Masters 2.
7547794	7552315	I do know the only thing that's behind closed doors at Konami because I still have my hookup.
7553561	7554862	is Pro Evolution Soccer.
7554902	7558043	So everything else that's on the floor is all they're showing.
7558424	7558924	Interesting.
7558944	7560404	It's pretty sad also.
7561005	7569188	Like, this E3 has been kind of let down in terms of what's being shown despite having two new consoles.
7570789	7573050	What about Dance Central 2?
7573330	7574991	Didn't you say you had some hands-on time with that?
7576071	7577052	Yeah, I played Dance Central 2.
7577092	7579513	It was fantastic.
7580151	7583233	but it was just in Central with new characters and new moves.
7583913	7585534	Is Harmonix showing anything else at their booth?
7585554	7586855	Aren't they supposed to be unveiling a new game?
7588436	7590277	Oh, I didn't see that at Harmonix booth.
7590437	7592299	I haven't seen a Harmonix booth at all.
7592319	7593039	That was at Microsoft.
7593820	7594320	Interesting.
7594360	7597222	So it must be kind of a behind closed doors thing or in a conference room.
7597602	7598002	Interesting.
7598563	7599603	Yeah, yeah.
7600704	7600964	Alright.
7601264	7604426	Well, anything else that you had some hands-on time with you want to share with us tonight?
7605707	7607288	I'm wracking my brain.
7608249	7608349	Um...
7610839	7612679	What's your plan for tomorrow?
7612739	7612799	I'm...
7636943	7648431	We'll be in a coin later to decide if I'm standing in line for Vita or Wii U. Personally, I'm leaning more towards Vita because I don't really think I care much about the Wii U at this point.
7649372	7649592	Ouch.
7650032	7651653	All right, yeah, we need someone to go play the Vita.
7651673	7653995	I don't know if Bobby will get around to it tomorrow, so I think you should do that.
7655516	7656497	Do the Vita?
7656517	7656717	Yep.
7657157	7657818	I'll try that one.
7658458	7663662	All right, well, anything else you want to share before we let you go so we can get to some other callers from our chat room at 1-877-GAMELAR?
7666072	7669514	The first thing, okay, this will be cool to some of those people out there.
7670735	7672435	Let's start with the lamer one first.
7672455	7678399	So I was walking down Hollywood Boulevard yesterday because that's where my place I'm staying at is.
7679359	7688904	And if people follow reality TV at all or gay porn, I totally ran into Dustin Zito from either Real World or Flat Pad.
7688924	7691145	That was pretty funny.
7691205	7693467	The one with the sordid past, apparently, yes.
7693847	7694007	Yes.
7694594	7697475	I wanted to just go up to him and be like, hey, I've seen you naked.
7697495	7699755	That might have been awkward.
7699775	7700835	I don't know.
7700895	7701836	Yeah, just slightly.
7703176	7713338	But the actual cool thing that people may care about is right when I walked out of the Nokia theater today after Nintendo was done, I ran Snapchat instead of Kiriyama Oka.
7713478	7714359	That was really cool.
7714719	7715099	Oh, nice.
7715119	7716779	Did you get a picture or anything or say hello?
7716839	7718259	Yeah, I got a picture.
7718319	7719060	I said hello.
7719700	7720420	We shook hands.
7721538	7725322	I tweeted him actually after the fact, and he tweeted back.
7725702	7731947	And him tweeting back at me, somehow G4 is not following my Twitter, which is a waste of their time.
7733529	7737032	It might be one of those spam Twitters, so look out, because I see a lot of those.
7737953	7738593	It's a real one.
7738953	7740675	I looked into it.
7740955	7741195	Weird.
7741215	7742236	Alright, well, whatever.
7742877	7745479	Alright, well, Miklatov, enjoy the rest of the show.
7745719	7748762	Get some hands-on with Vita tomorrow and whatever else, and we'll talk to you again tomorrow, okay?
7750086	7757747	Okay, sounds good Alright, and try to stalk more celebrities for us Yes, I will do that Take care, buddy Alright, bye
7758667	7763991	We're running a little long tonight, but we will open it up for a few quick, quick calls if anyone wants to call and just talk impressions.
7764051	7765052	What do you think?
7765332	7765992	Where are you at?
7766072	7770916	Are we completely off base with what we're saying about Wii U or Kinect or the Vita?
7771536	7776700	Give us a call 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7776740	7777341	That's all one word.
7777381	7781003	If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you use Echo 123 first.
7782344	7784306	Before you give us a call again What were your impressions?
7784346	7797738	I'm sure many of you You know, I didn't want to just recap the news tonight with you guys Because I'm sure most of you were watching it Although I'm liking hearing about these hidden things Like that Konami game that sounds like Lemmings I want to hear about more of those types of games
7799440	7800760	So, we'll see.
7801220	7805481	Alright, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7805521	7816943	Quick programming note, we are live tonight, we are live tomorrow night, we are off Sunday because Bobby Blackwolf and some of us here at OLR are going to go celebrate E3 broadcast by going to Disneyland.
7817143	7819944	I'm sorry, we're doing research for Disney Connect Adventures.
7819964	7821924	We've got to make sure that Disney Connect game is accurate.
7822284	7822925	Absolutely.
7823005	7824425	And we will leave no stone unturned.
7825545	7827807	And there have to be hidden cats in the game for it to be accurate.
7828227	7831529	But we will be back next Sunday on Orange Lounge Radio.
7832129	7834270	That will be June the 19th.
7834731	7837512	Bobby Blackwolf will be here June the 12th.
7837692	7842195	Not here, but at allgames.com where he's usually at June the 12th and of course on his podcast feed.
7842455	7846658	That's where you're going to hear his Thursday impressions since we will not be live Thursday night.
7846678	7848599	So I hope everybody got the programming worked out there.
7849059	7853282	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7853522	7853602	And...
7854262	7856705	I have to point out, Sega did not announce a system
7875504	7876024	I don't remember.
7876564	7880725	Well, apology, that's kind of a gray area.
7880745	7882146	He said they weren't even going to mention it.
7882926	7883566	True.
7883606	7885467	Which they let off with by saying, mentioning.
7885767	7887067	Alright, let me get to the phones.
7887167	7888768	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
7889468	7890288	Hey, it's Sterlok.
7890428	7891568	Hey Sterlok, how you doing buddy?
7892269	7892629	Pretty good.
7892849	7893969	How's E3 going for you?
7894009	7894589	What are your thoughts?
7896550	7898170	It looks pretty awesome.
7899191	7900071	I really want a Vita.
7901091	7901391	Why?
7902912	7903892	Street Fighter vs Tekken.
7905051	7907553	But can't you get that on the PS3 or the 360?
7908454	7909515	Yeah, but come on, man.
7909535	7910456	It's a portable version.
7910596	7911517	That's just awesome.
7912078	7914780	What did you think about this whole announcement that Cole's in it as well?
7915921	7917423	I was like, what?
7917803	7918143	Okay.
7919425	7919765	Whatever.
7919945	7921587	It's kind of random, right?
7921707	7924790	I mean, it's pretty common for Namco, though.
7924830	7929334	I mean, you've got Tekken characters and, like, Urban Rain, so...
7930712	7931352	I guess that's true.
7932493	7934554	They do that kind of stuff all the time.
7934854	7938756	Nintendo... I don't know.
7938796	7941497	I still can't get my head around this name.
7942279	7946981	Yeah, I know, the name's a little weird, but remember, I mean, and I don't like the name either, to be honest.
7947001	7952644	I think they should have just called it the Nintendo U, and we could have just all said, oh, the U stands for Ultra, or something like that, you know?
7953604	7960848	Or if they wanted to go back to, like, the old school, they could have called it the U-Force, like that old peripheral.
7961368	7962588	The Super Wii.
7963049	7965470	I like the Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii.
7965490	7966710	Yeah, I've been doing that all day, too.
7966730	7969512	I was just like, oh, my God.
7970032	7970232	So...
7972202	7973183	Dammit, where was I going with this?
7973923	7979486	Everybody's got an opinion on the Wii U. What do you think of the console itself besides just the name?
7982969	7986691	Which I do think everyone will get used to eventually, by the way.
7987011	7988332	Oh, do we have a network outage?
7988392	7988772	I think we did.
7988792	7989472	I think we had a drop.
7989573	7989913	Shit.
7990713	7991594	Are we still on Ustream?
7995156	7997517	I don't know if we're even still broadcasting at this point.
7997577	7998418	I think we are.
7998998	8001800	But we had an internet... Okay, we had an internet downtime...
8003411	8006752	Oh wow, we just reconnected right away with Strelok.
8007052	8011494	Okay, yeah, we had a weird drop thing happen there, so that's weird, but we're back.
8011514	8012254	Silly internets.
8013054	8013954	Yeah, silly internets.
8014434	8015235	Alright, well, whatever.
8015875	8019476	So, what's on your mind with the Wii U?
8020476	8023957	I'd like to see more from it, just, you know, this Ectema stuff.
8024978	8029279	The controller is kind of interesting, even though I honestly really can't...
8030575	8057557	I don't want to use too much of it but it's an interesting concept but really what has me excited is something from the Microsoft it's not the only thing that I really cared about from the Microsoft press conference but something they kind of touched on briefly was the whole Bing thing with Kinect where you could you can
8059526	8061867	Tell it what to play.
8063308	8066650	If you want to search for a game and then play it by voice, you can do that.
8067130	8068231	And that's really exciting.
8068791	8070452	Xbox, Bing, pornography.
8070892	8071152	Yes.
8072513	8072933	Awesome.
8073753	8074073	Indeed.
8074093	8082878	A lot of people are kind of on what Microsoft showed.
8083058	8084939	What did you think of the press conference overall?
8085552	8087714	Overall, the Microsoft conference, yeah, exactly.
8087734	8088495	It was just kind of like, really?
8088555	8089115	More shooters?
8089415	8089796	Don't care.
8090856	8091917	Too many first-person shooters, huh?
8091957	8092838	Too many shooters.
8092898	8094039	It's oversaturated.
8094279	8094539	All right.
8094840	8096401	We're going to let you go as we get some other calls.
8096461	8098323	Before we do, any other final thoughts for us?
8101045	8102406	I just want more.
8103087	8108091	I want Konami to announce the Snatcher game, but that didn't happen.
8108891	8109932	Sadly, it's probably not going to.
8110092	8111033	Don't hold your breath.
8111053	8111614	I was going to say.
8111694	8111934	All right.
8111954	8112614	All right, buddy.
8112634	8114496	We're going to let you go to get some more calls, but have a good one, okay?
8115037	8115457	Alright, thanks.
8115597	8116138	Alright, thank you.
8116558	8117978	Thanks for putting up with the internet outage, too.
8117998	8118639	That was kind of weird.
8119139	8120400	It's just another day here at OLR.
8121120	8122661	Yeah, I've been having... Hey, what's up, guys?
8122681	8123421	This is Kaijudo.
8123681	8124922	Hey, Kaijudo, what's on your mind, buddy?
8126302	8133146	I just wanted to say that the Wii U, the controller, scares the fucking hell out of me.
8133346	8134386	Why does it scare you?
8135907	8138568	I mean, it looks like it's going to break.
8138628	8140389	I mean, all the stuff they want you to do with it,
8141058	8143502	doesn't seem very safe for the controller.
8143522	8148048	You know, like putting it down on the floor, sticking it on that gun and swinging it around.
8149114	8150996	It just looks like a lot of kids are going to break that thing.
8151116	8163027	You know, I think you're kind of on to something here because I can't tell you, and this is kind of embarrassing, but I can't tell you how many headsets I've broken on my computer because I'll sit it down on my chair when I get up to go to the bathroom and then when I come back, crunch, my fat ass sits on it and crunches it.
8163267	8164509	So you have to be really careful.
8164729	8172616	Like you're going to need, everybody needs a coffee table to put that controller on and that's away from the dogs and the cats that tend to eat things.
8172636	8173337	Yeah, it's like the big...
8173857	8179402	The big glass on it, it's like, you know, it just, to me, it seems like it's going to just break within a couple of weeks.
8179442	8180002	Hold on, though.
8180423	8181203	Let's be real.
8181263	8182564	It's not really glass.
8182624	8185107	It's that cheap plastic-y thing that the DSs use.
8185147	8187068	It's the same touchscreen from a DS, just bigger.
8188169	8188369	Oh, okay.
8188429	8189150	I didn't know that.
8189210	8190111	It looks like glass to me.
8190231	8192192	Yeah, they will get, it'll still get broken, but yeah.
8192853	8198638	So, well, let's say that controller is invincible.
8199358	8201160	What is your thoughts about Wii U otherwise?
8203424	8206547	As far as being innovative, I think they're going somewhere with it.
8206707	8208488	I'm going to agree with Bobby Blackwolf.
8208548	8211891	I saw a lot of potential with what they were showing that you could do with it.
8212391	8224680	I mean, it's still not something that I want to run out and get right away until I see something that I really like, but I do appreciate them for trying to bring some innovation to the game.
8224720	8229444	Even though they're recycling the same old games, just putting Mario on everything, but
8230430	8234551	Other than that, I mean, they are innovative with their shit.
8236772	8242274	I get a lot of feedback, by the way, just to let you know.
8242454	8243534	I'm like hearing myself talking.
8243554	8245495	Yeah, we have an echo thing going on.
8245975	8247615	Do you have the Ustream running?
8247635	8248916	Because you've got to pause it.
8249516	8255858	The other thing is, at what price do you think the Wii U becomes too expensive right now? $3.99.
8260371	8262032	So if it's $3.98, you might be there.
8263373	8266657	No, I get it at $2.98.
8268198	8266657	$2.99, $2.98.
8269139	8273102	All right, well, Kajudo, we're going to let you go to see if we can get another call, but thanks so much for the call.
8273143	8273523	Take care, buddy.
8274464	8275665	Alright, goodnight.
8275685	8276145	Later.
8276165	8279246	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8279286	8279886	Give us a call.
8280447	8285789	And as we start to wrap up here while we wait for one more call, where are you guys at?
8285849	8290091	You know, a lot of people feel the need to rank Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony.
8290471	8292952	But let me kind of leave it here with this.
8293192	8297113	Out of what we've talked about tonight, what are you most excited about?
8297294	8299955	What are you most interested in hearing more about?
8300775	8301335	Dark Sakura?
8301555	8302176	Animal Crossing.
8303036	8303296	Okay.
8304837	8305238	No, really.
8307920	8311063	To be honest, I'm still actually kind of meh about a bunch of it, really.
8312825	8315787	There were things I had hoped to see that didn't pop out.
8317109	8322694	And really, it was a lot more of what I expected, although I do really like that new controller.
8323154	8328139	I'm more excited about that controller for the Wii U, even though the name is, you know, stupid.
8328599	8333162	Alright, we'll get to the other feedback in studio here in a minute, but we do have another call coming in, so let's get to that.
8333222	8334743	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8335604	8337966	Hey, this is Blender from Napa, what's going on?
8338006	8339287	Blender, what's on your mind?
8340127	8351035	Nothing, I just, one thing, I don't know if you guys mentioned, I was like five minutes late getting into the show, and nobody mentioned, I was really interested in the Bioshock Infinite
8351548	8352749	with the move support.
8371344	8373906	I'll finally get to wipe the cobwebs off of my move.
8373926	8376068	Yeah, kind of like Gabe Newell last year.
8391480	8393460	And they're like, oh, we like money.
8393560	8396181	And they're like, all right, put move support in your game.
8396201	8399842	And they're like, oh, okay, and say something good about the move for us.
8400222	8402082	All right, I can do that because I like money.
8402302	8404883	It was like Gabe Newell last year with the whole Valve thing.
8405623	8406223	Exactly.
8408483	8409883	Well, what else caught your eye, Blender?
8410964	8414484	Well, Uncharted 3, of course.
8414604	8416005	I'm just a huge Uncharted fan.
8416025	8417565	The multiplayer looks fantastic.
8417945	8418105	Mm-hmm.
8418925	8422047	But other than that, well, see, I only own one system.
8422107	8426009	I only own the Sony, so... So there's not a lot for you on the other ones.
8426789	8432772	Did maybe, I have to ask it, did Microsoft or Nintendo maybe make you think twice about picking up another one?
8433693	8438055	Not Nintendo, but Microsoft, I mean, I'm still kind of on the edge.
8438115	8441176	I mean, I'm not a fanboy.
8442057	8444458	If I had the money, I would pick up another system, you know.
8445338	8445979	But it's just...
8447702	8452346	Mainly, what I've been listening to is just for the Microsoft thing.
8453968	8454188	All right.
8454248	8457991	Would be like, if they did it, they'd need to make a Kinect, like an L.A.
8458031	8459973	Noire Kinect game.
8460353	8461474	That would tell me.
8461554	8463636	Where I can just slap the bitch if I think they're lying.
8463656	8465078	Yeah, yeah.
8465858	8466098	Pop.
8466138	8466459	All right.
8466479	8470002	Or have your partner do, hey, go over there and go investigate this for me.
8470022	8470863	I'm going to go have a beer.
8470883	8471163	Yeah.
8471368	8471689	All right.
8472049	8474052	Blinder, any other last thoughts for us before we let you go?
8474112	8474773	No, that's it.
8474933	8475214	All right.
8475474	8475975	Take care.
8476315	8476876	We'll see you later.
8476896	8477076	All right.
8477096	8477377	You too.
8477517	8477737	All right.
8477777	8477997	Bye.
8478518	8478739	All right.
8478939	8480621	We are going to go ahead and close the Skype line, guys.
8480641	8482264	I'm very sorry to those folks that didn't get through.
8482344	8487471	Don't forget, we're going to be back tomorrow, and we'll have a little more time to take more calls tomorrow.
8487782	8489283	So if you didn't get through tonight, don't be mad.
8489523	8492205	You can also email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
8492225	8495547	We will go to the mailbag tomorrow because we won't have press conferences.
8495807	8497668	We're going to hear about other games tomorrow.
8497968	8499089	We still haven't talked Skyrim.
8499109	8500349	We've got to talk a little bit about Skyrim.
8500630	8501270	Some of the other games.
8501310	8503051	We'll probably dive into Bioshock a little more.
8503291	8507133	Whatever it is that Bobby and Shane can get their hands on, we're going to talk a little more about tomorrow.
8507374	8509775	And your calls will really help fill in and emails tomorrow.
8510035	8511175	and Chibi Wolf.
8511576	8512816	And Chibi Wolf, let's hope.
8513476	8515957	For now, I want to go around and get everybody's kind of last thought here.
8516337	8520739	And again, guys, sorry to cut it off, but we were only intending on going until 9 and it's almost 9.30.
8521579	8525380	So I want to try and wrap up and everybody's being a real trooper for staying with us.
8525440	8528481	But Dan, what are you walking away from this most excited about?
8529262	8532503	The Wii U. The Wii U. Why is that?
8534904	8536004	It could be really awesome.
8537228	8539229	Or it could fucking suck.
8539269	8540250	Well, that's exactly it.
8540330	8549814	If Nintendo comes through with the price, they come through with the games, and some people do some great development for it, I mean, it could be really, really smooth.
8550835	8552516	And it could do a lot of cool stuff.
8552696	8555037	Or it could be an absolute waste of technology.
8555057	8557438	And Nintendo's scary because Nintendo does that.
8557818	8560760	Sometimes Nintendo hits something and they just knock it out of the park.
8560820	8565042	And then sometimes Nintendo's just like, yeah, look at our great thing.
8565362	8566702	We have no fucking idea what to do with it
8587589	8597780	I was like, okay, maybe Sony's learned a thing, but it's just a better PSP where the Vita could be something completely new.
8597820	8600523	They didn't just say, okay, here's a new Wii controller.
8600563	8604788	They said, here is a new different thing that no one's done before.
8605649	8607411	And that could be pretty slick.
8608382	8609042	I'm with you there.
8609482	8616984	I want to go to chat real quick because one of the other games that's being brought up in chat right now that we didn't get into depth about today, Randy Yu says, Batman, Batman, Batman.
8617285	8619625	And Blender says, did you see the Catwoman trailer, Randy Yu?
8620045	8622246	Which was shown at one of the press conferences.
8622306	8629268	Now, I got to say, there were two things out of the whole three press conferences that made me audibly say, what?
8630828	8631228	Wow.
8631568	8633709	I said wow twice during the press conferences.
8634209	8636990	One of them was the $499 3D monitor.
8637170	8637670	I said wow.
8638011	8643392	The other one was when they announced that Batman Arkham City was going to be on the Wii U. Batman on Nintendo.
8644533	8645013	I don't know why.
8645073	8646293	It's just crazy to me.
8647254	8653876	If they don't have to make huge graphic compromises, it means that the Wii U has at least the horsepower of the current generation of consoles.
8654028	8654369	Correct.
8654769	8656031	So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
8656872	8658053	Loki, I know you still need to answer.
8658634	8659635	Let me go first here.
8660336	8663460	I'm going to say the thing I am most excited to see more about.
8663881	8664601	I'm going to be honest.
8664702	8666524	I'm going to go kind of off the beaten path here a little bit.
8666584	8669127	Although the Wii U, yes, of course I'm going to see more of that.
8669207	8670028	I really just feel like...
8671270	8673472	Everything is fucking speculation until next year.
8674193	8675614	It's so, so early.
8675754	8679558	Now we know that most of the rumors were true and we've seen where they're going with it.
8679578	8687907	But for me, the more immediate question, I actually want to see these hardcore games with the Kinect functionality.
8688247	8690149	I want to see how the public responds to it.
8690569	8691170	I want to see...
8693152	8696154	When I play Connect, I do really like it.
8696394	8701318	And I really want so much more out of the Connect.
8701458	8704340	And I'm really curious how some of these shooters are going to play.
8704860	8709424	I kind of even want to play the Ghost Recon game just to check it out.
8709804	8711885	That is never a game I'd be interested in otherwise.
8712025	8712566	It's so weird.
8712606	8713526	I'll save you the trouble.
8714087	8715628	The response is going to be, eh.
8718353	8720375	Maybe two people are going to buy it.
8720495	8724059	That's what Twitter will say, but what will the dollars say?
8724927	8726608	That's what the dollars are going to say.
8726748	8727168	You think?
8727388	8728929	I disagree.
8729109	8732411	In my life, I've dealt with a lot of mainstream gamers.
8732771	8750039	I've worked at game stores for 10 years, and I've seen those guys come into the store, and the Twitter crowd, as much as I hate to say it, is kind of the voice of the quote-unquote hardcore gamer, the guy who cares enough to be
8750559	8756324	Sitting on the computer watching that press conference and not because he's going to come on here tonight and talk about it.
8758045	8761628	There's just not going to be a lot of interest.
8761848	8763449	It'd be sweet if they could pull it off.
8763589	8766071	I'm the first guy to admit I have an unopened connect.
8766151	8766772	It's Jamie's.
8769284	8770125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8789608	8791951	Ghost Squad on the Wii is fucking awesome Ghost Squad is an awesome game
8800856	8802957	and the Wii Zapper is a good Ghost Squad controller.
8803017	8804538	I wanted the Ghost Squad rifle.
8804579	8806039	No, okay, that's a little too far there.
8806059	8808521	Because it's got the little trigger and it's got the pull thing.
8808541	8808921	No, no, no.
8809001	8810002	The Leico perfect shot.
8810162	8811663	Yeah, well, that's a little better.
8811823	8816206	I wanted the Ghost Squad rifle to be the Xbox 360 rifle and it just never happened.
8816346	8818428	I like that new Kinect looking rifle.
8818448	8819949	Oh, not Kinect, the Move rifle, by the way.
8819969	8820429	It looks cool.
8820589	8835143	I gotta say though, Dan, I'm not disagreeing with your perspective necessarily about who the hardcore gamers are and all that, but I gotta say, I really think that with no Wii U this year, Microsoft kind of has that Nintendo soccer mom casual market cornered this year.
8835883	8839505	And it's just going to be interesting to see what Kinect games rise to the top.
8839765	8842087	Will it just be Dance Central 2, number one seller this year?
8842647	8847310	Or will that Kinect functionality float a hardcore game up to the top?
8847330	8851952	Well, they need to come up with their Wii Sports Resort or with their Wii Fit.
8852353	8855214	That one game that just every Kinect owner has to have.
8855234	8855714	Dance Central.
8855775	8856875	I think it's Dance Central.
8856935	8858076	But it's not Dance Central.
8858496	8867483	All the dance fans love Dance Central, but the common folks aren't just like, oh man, Dance Central, because I was in a room full of common people the other day, and nobody really liked Dance Central.
8867523	8867864	Really?
8868344	8874929	See, I would say Dance Central, not just like music fans like us who've been following it for years, but like rock band fans, which is a much wider audience.
8875290	8876711	Air guitar freaks!
8876771	8878012	Anyway, we gotta get towards wrapping up.
8878252	8879573	I've gotta let Loki have his say.
8879633	8881615	Loki, what left you wanting more?
8882675	8883016	Saints Row 3.
8884895	8885796	Earth Saints Row the 3rd.
8886316	8886937	It's awesome.
8887217	8890981	And goddammit, I wish they'd just announce a new Grand Theft Auto and be done with it.
8891241	8891942	No kidding.
8892583	8893884	And Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
8894104	8894985	Fuck you, Valve.
8895005	8896446	Fuck you right in the ear.
8896466	8897267	We know it's coming.
8897287	8898248	I mean, come on.
8898328	8900430	Just come out and say it.
8901411	8902092	That's really it.
8903467	8904648	Alright, fuck that!
8925797	8930923	What titles Nintendo is going to have that are exclusive to this that are actually going to be worth my time.
8931443	8933605	Instead of saying, hey, look, we got this really cool thing.
8933806	8935147	Because here's the problem.
8935527	8941914	They're hoping that the publishers are going to be creative enough to use this technology that they built.
8942435	8946659	Last time I checked, it never was a problem that, oh, these games aren't creative enough.
8947200	8947320	It's...
8947901	8959041	Oh, we just don't give a crap about fleshing out this game to the point of, you know, attracting other people other than casual gamers because, eh, casual gamers still buy whatever as long as it's $19.99.
8963522	8963882	All right.
8964903	8969125	Well, anything you guys are hoping... Well, Loki, you're not going to be here tomorrow.
8969285	8970646	No, I'm not going to be here.
8970806	8973808	And Dan will be here and DarkSakura and myself.
8974248	8979511	But since you kind of have... This is your last chance to say whatever you want on the show here about E3 till next Sunday.
8979971	8982053	Anything else you kind of want to get out about your thoughts on the show?
8983734	8987576	I mean, other than just like some of the stuff that's already been out.
8987676	8989477	There's nothing really that's like brand new.
8989497	8993340	Nothing out of those conferences that was really just caught me off guard.
8993740	8996362	You know, I don't know.
8996482	8998624	It was just no real surprises.
8998784	9000405	Nothing like, oh my God, that's so amazing.
9000585	9001225	And you could see it.
9001325	9002946	The crowds weren't into it.
9002986	9007930	There were like one or two pops when something that they were supposed to pop at came.
9007970	9012253	There were a lot of pauses where the companies expected applause and nobody was into it.
9013402	9020998	it was a very apathetic attitude even the big stuff that people were supposed to be into just didn't win people over
9022925	9026306	We'll be back tomorrow to do some more E3 coverage.
9026686	9030367	DarkSakura, myself, Dan, and you guys in our chat room.
9030387	9036209	And of course, in LA, a big thanks to Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov are both in LA.
9036249	9038609	And they'll be back with more game opinions tomorrow.
9038929	9041850	But for tonight, we say goodnight.
9042230	9043271	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
9043351	9047272	We'll see you back here tomorrow at our little temporary space here on Ustream.
9047872	9049732	7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
9050393	9051473	No video yet.
9052153	9060176	But hopefully you stream in the future, and not tomorrow either, but you stream in the future, we might have some more video features, kind of like we used to back in the day on OLR.
9060376	9064938	Besides that, I'm so completely unglamorous right now, I can't be on video or it will explode.
9064978	9067119	So that's going to do it for our E3 coverage tonight.
9067139	9069400	We'll be back tomorrow, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
9069640	9070300	We'll see you here.
9070640	9072461	Email us, mailbag at orangeautoradio.com.
9072501	9073221	Follow us on Twitter.
9073281	9074241	Follow Bobby on Twitter.
9075202	9075602	See you tomorrow.
