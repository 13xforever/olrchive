Tonight, December 11th, 2011, an official Xbox Live app shows up on Apple devices.
One of the Operation Rainfall games is announced for release in Europe, and Metal Gear meets Bayonetta in a new game trailer.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live tonight with the 438th episode of our show on this December the 11th of 2011.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she always does week in and week out, say hello to one of my co-hosts, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Roar.
Roar, how are you doing?
Roar.
You are a beast tonight.
I am rawr.
Now you're a sexy beast.
I'm always a sexy beast.
What are you talking about?
Except, you know, I'm really not.
Talking about your outfit on Thursday, which we'll get to in a minute.
You were a little bit of a sexy beast.
I like that outfit.
You were rocking the flower in your hair.
My makeup got all screwed up by the end of the night.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and the fast food choice for tonight is McDonald's which does not service an official endorsement of the program I am not endorsing McDonald's that's for sure I've been actually trying to shy away from McDonald's but the problem is
On the way to the show, it's like, okay, you've got Carl's Jr., Burger King, and McDonald's.
And Carl's Jr.
had a line of seven cars.
I didn't want to go to Burger King.
I just decided not to go to Burger King because it's kind of hard to get into that parking lot and out of that parking lot.
These are real problems, people.
And I had Burger King for the last two days.
But they're Chef's Choice Burger, man.
It's good shit.
Yeah.
That is some good stuff.
This, however, not good stuff.
This would be the double quarter pounder that they made completely weird.
What?
No McRib?
Dude, the McRib is nasty, okay?
I'm sorry.
McRib is not... No, I know.
The McRib is nasty, but it's all everyone ever talks about.
Have you ever read the nutritional information on that?
No, thank you.
That's because there isn't any.
Ha ha.
No, it's there.
It's just not very nutritional.
All right, look, believe it or not, we're a podcast about video games and live show, not just food.
But let me introduce the chatters.
I have to introduce, of course, our chat room, the lovely folks that join us week in and week out live.
Because, of course, we are live at All Games Radio, which we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
And if you want to join us in the chat room, just point your browsers to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
or of course if you have an IRC client you can get on that way too by connecting to the Game Surge Network and it's Channel Orange Lounge but most people just prefer the easy way out so there you go choose whatever way you want to do but come talk with us and some folks in there are talking about retweeting the show status good idea thank you for helping to promote the show appreciate it and then MPRA2 is saying well back to Battlefield 3 sorry OLR I gotta unlock fire extinguisher for my jets so I guess we lost out to Battlefield tonight that makes me sad
A lot of people have been playing Battlefield.
I always go on to see what everyone else is playing.
Very tempted a lot of times to see Saints Row.
I'm like, could go play some Saints Row.
Skyrim is... I need to do meaningless tasks in Skyrim.
Well, I was going to say, no matter which friends list we're talking about, on my 360, everybody's playing Skyrim.
On my PlayStation 3, everybody's playing Skyrim.
Like, it really...
No, last night it was all Battlefield 3.
Do you know what consistently, again, between the two systems is number one, though?
What I see people on more than anything else on the systems?
The answer's easier than you think.
Modern Warfare 3?
Netflix.
Ah, yeah.
Even though... Well, let's talk about this a little bit.
Let's get into games a little bit.
Talk about the new Xbox remodel that happened this week.
Because, you know, they launched the new Xbox dashboard.
What do they call it?
The Xbox...
Dashboard?
Is that what it's called?
Experience?
I don't know what it is.
It's technically a dashboard.
So, I guess what they're trying to do is they're trying to... Call it boring.
Well, they're trying to integrate Kinect more into it, you know, and have it be that way, but... Whoopty shit.
Here it is.
Long story short.
Look, if you have a 360, you've probably already seen it.
You know, the entire internet was trying to download it that day, and it was delayed, etc., etc.
Everybody's seen it by now, but I gotta be honest.
Eh.
Like, it's prettier.
I'll give it that.
The ads...
Kind of stick out a lot more.
I noticed that too right away.
But it's really built for the Kinect.
And I just think it's kind of... Not a big fan of it.
I mean, you know, the Kinect's cool and all, but I don't want it shoved down my throat.
And I kind of feel like this new Xbox redesign kind of really shoves the Kinect down your throat.
And like, I don't know about you guys, but in my apartment, the Xbox is not always that... Or Kinect and all that is not always that responsive.
And I don't want to...
Use it.
I mean, it's fine if I light things up to play Dance Central or whatever, but in my low-lit apartment otherwise, I don't like to try and use Kinect.
I understand people think it's cool, and by people I mean Microsoft, think it's cool to have voice commands and Kinect commands and stuff like that for...
all the stuff in there you can wave your hand back and forth to like scroll through the pages or or I can take less time a fraction of a second less to move my thumb slightly to the left or right on my analog stick to do the exact same thing um it's just like
I don't understand... I mean, yeah, you gotta support the Kinect, and that's fine that you wanna add more connectivity to, you know, the dashboard, but... I just... I think it's unnecessary.
I mean, and it's kind of a step backwards for a lot of things.
It made a lot of stuff a lot harder to find.
I mean, there's pros and there's cons.
On the one hand, it's really easy, like, if I think of an old game that's on my Xbox that I wanna play, like, let's say, um...
Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering.
I can go play that game, which maybe I haven't played in a long time.
But otherwise, kind of digging through my collection is a lot of key presses to get to because you have to kind of scroll over.
It does kind of like that it's a crossbar but not really thing where it's weird.
I don't really like it.
I mean, it's prettier, but in practicality, it's kind of an annoyance.
I think a lot of stuff's harder to find.
Although you have Bing if you know what you're looking for.
Bing does not search the internet.
I think a lot of people assumed because Bing is like a competitor to Google that you'd be able to like Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, and you'd get taken to our website.
But now, no.
If you try to Bing Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think you get anything at all.
The icons that used to be up on the marketplace have been long gone.
The all-games icons they took down when the avatars launched.
You can still use them if you have them.
Rob, you made me laugh just now.
Why?
What'd I do?
Magic the Gathering.
Magic the Gathering
Outro Music
This update is no longer available, and it clits the game.
So this game I bought for $10 maybe a year ago, like I can't play anymore because they decided to remove the update, is like this trying to force me into the 2012 version of the game?
I don't even know.
That kind of irritated me.
Technically, we could get you the update, but I mean, it's still a pain in the ass to do that.
technically meaning download it from the internet, but I shouldn't have to do that, right?
It should just work.
So anyway, I kind of think the new Xbox experience is a little eh.
The whole reason I brought it up in the first place, going back to chat, and chat reminded me of this, is that they took out the party feature from Netflix.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
They're kind of having to adapt to it.
So I'm thinking the movie studio is probably pressured into removing the party feature because it never showed up on any other console.
Yeah, because if you think about it, oh, I want to watch a movie with my friends.
Well, if you want to watch a movie with your friends, you're going to go buy the damn DVD.
That's what the movie studio is thinking probably.
Yeah, it's a little weird.
But there were some people that really liked that feature that it got taken away.
I didn't realize how many people were using it until I saw the QQing on my Twitter.
So...
Well, and then they made indie games harder to find also.
I just, you know, download whatever I'm going to watch and then watch it with a couple of friends on AIM.
But I mean, I guess it was the same thing.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I really want to watch games, I mean, technically technically, couldn't I, and I don't know if this is possible, maybe the chat can help me out here.
Couldn't I open up like the Xbox party and open up like one of those cross-game chat dealies and then go into Netflix and say, okay, on the count of three, press the start button.
One, two, three, start.
Or because it wouldn't really work because people's
I don't know, Mike.
It would just be wait five seconds before commenting or something?
I don't know.
DarkSakura.com
Ooh, me!
I don't have negative stuff to say.
No, I had a great time.
And so I'm sure those of you that watch the video feed, and if you haven't seen the video feed yet, you can check it out.
It is archived at umlaut.org, and it takes you to the little Ustream archived presentation, which was part of GameSpots, I guess, providing the bandwidth or what have you for that whole thing.
You know, there were some audio problems in the beginning, which, you know, just my luck, my first live shot's gonna go wrong or something like that.
So it was very nerve-wracking, but at the end I was feeling a lot better with the interviews and so forth, and people were very complimentary, so I was very happy and got a lot of people to come out and donate, which is the most important thing of all, of course, is the donation.
But I just wanted to say, you know, despite all the technical things that happened, you
and DarkSakura.com
but having the very professional people from the AV Society that were helping to put it on was such a relief because like truly and I'm not just saying this to kiss ass because I truly truly feel this way like everybody was super professional and just super awesome
And were people stressed out?
Sure.
I mean, there was a lot to get stressed out about.
Some guests weren't there and some video clips weren't around.
You know, it stings.
We get stressed out at OLR when the internet goes down and we can't do our show like we planned.
You know, things happen.
But it's kind of the way that people kind of react to those change and still interact with each other.
I just really felt there was still like a really high level of professionalism.
So I just got to give kudos to all those people that put it on.
I mean, was it scary?
Yes.
But was it rewarding?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
So I had a fantastic time.
And you were cute.
Your hat was cute.
Thank you.
You've got something on you.
Thank you.
I have a little thread.
Yeah, so a co-worker went shopping with me the other night.
We bought an all new outfit.
So I'm like, oh, excuse to go shopping.
I like that shirt, but I understand Alan's stealing it from you.
Yes, yes.
That's what happens is that, you know, I buy a shirt and then, you know, Alan says, no, I want that shirt.
Steal.
No.
I'm wearing the shirt that I bought for that night, but I really just bought it to wear under that, my hoodie.
Okay.
Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, no catfights backstage?
No, no, it's all in the name of charity.
Actually, I gotta say this.
This is the cool thing is that, you know, and I was mentioning this a little bit on the call on Bobby's show is that, you know, one of the other co-hosts was really well known on Twitch TV, yet it was streamed on Ustream, and you had people behind the scenes from GameSpot and IGN, but you know what?
At the end of the day,
Who cares?
Who cares?
It's for charity.
Like, you know, day jobs and all those allegiances and so forth are one thing and the communities we're into.
But at the end of the day, it isn't about us and about our ego.
Everybody really did truly check those in at the door because it was about the charity.
And I honestly, the people I was working with anyway, I don't think have ego anyway.
So, you know, I didn't sense that at all.
I ran into one thing that I'm really not going to discuss, but I think I did a very fluid sidestep of drama.
Yeah.
You know why I say fluid?
Because I drank.
Anytime you get a group of nerds together, it's always bound to be a hilarious time.
Anyhow, going to our other chatroom, chat.orange.com, Tigerclaw says, everyone loved your beard, Rob.
You know, Tigerclaw, I seem to remember you specifically thought the beard was weird at first, so I'm glad you've come full circle and come to embrace the beard that I started a couple months ago.
I appreciate it.
Let's see.
Going back to our chat room, Actdeft says, I did watch Umlaut Live.
I did see the last part of the pre-show.
Well, thank you.
It was good times.
It was really good times.
And they actually, it wasn't just the pre-show they broadcast live, but they broadcast the whole thing, all the bands.
And I gotta say,
Just hilarious, imaginative bands.
And if you missed us talking about what Umlaut is on last week's show, in a nutshell, people pay money to play rock band on an actual concert stage.
And so, of course, they go all out.
And all the money goes to the Child's Play charity.
I liked the Aperture band.
Oh yeah, the one that was all dressed up like Devo, the Devoid or whatever, that was phenomenal.
And even that very first band that came out after the introduction, they were all dressed up like Harry Potter characters, and they did You Oughta Know for whatever reason, but I was like, they're Gryffindor kids singing You Oughta Know, it's funny.
But it's great, everybody went all out.
I'll tell you this, here's something you didn't hear on the pre-show, literally, because the mic was dead.
The First Guy I'm Interviewing Gay Riot
Thank you for watching!
there's something you missed out on by there not being audio that was that was a fun interview I feel sorry for that guy they were all good sports these people completely pulled like for real like I will admit like the raffle fairy Amanda she's a good friend of mine so of course I wanted to bring her on but a lot of those people were complete strangers and really good sports and some great interviews I had a fun time
I had a good time, too.
Anyhow.
Because I was helping to test out the free play setup, which I set up half of it before my hand said, oh, no.
You were singing a lot of songs in there before they opened the doors.
I heard you.
Well, I always have to, I can't use earplugs because they always make my ears hurt more for some reason.
But I have this fear of being out of key.
which people who know me know why I have that problem so I was trying to make sure everything was you know set up and finally there was this one dude in there who was a super cool and we played a band on the run and that made me happy because anyone who appreciates Paul McCartney in the wings is cool in my book
All right, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungerated.com.
Tigerclaw says, Rob, it would have been great if you got on stage and sang some of the songs.
You know, I would have done it, but I wasn't sure if I could because of the other stuff I was doing.
But I think in retrospect, I probably still would have just been able to buy a band spot and been on at the end.
So maybe next year.
Like, I'm not opposed to it.
It's for a good cause.
It's a great thing.
We bought raffle tickets.
Alan and I won a raffle prize.
I haven't got to play it yet because we had to leave before it was over because keep in mind San Francisco is a two-hour drive and I had to work the next day with a morning meeting.
So we won the raffle prize late, but we won some fishing game on the Wii.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Some of these expensive systems we talk about, like 3DS and some of this stuff, even if they're too young to enjoy this stuff, Child's Play goes so far to get coloring books and things like that.
Remember, this is just a really tough time of year.
A lot of kids sometimes don't easily have access to that stuff when they're going through a really hard time.
So Child's Play kind of helps deliver that.
So just think about that.
But no stuffed animals.
It's actually another thing.
If you're going to donate a toy, do not donate a stuffed animal because they do carry germs.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, I was going to go in and set it up and then I was just not feeling well.
We had a busy beginning of the week because I know you had a lot of rush design projects.
I had a lot of design to do.
I had Umlaut.
I had the American River Review release party, which by the way, the 2012 American River Review is out.
If you go to arc.losrios.edu and go to the bookstore link, you can order a copy.
So if our international audience wants to see what the local community college here at OLR does...
and Culinary Recipes, which I laid out.
Look at you showing your college pride.
I love it.
I'm pretty proud of it.
You should be.
Well, ARC is like the biggest junior college in California.
Is there any video gaming content in the magazine?
Not quite, but there's plenty of pop culture.
Maybe that should be something you should think about for next year.
Just saying.
Well, I'm hoping next year we actually get some of the 3D modelers putting their stuff in.
Okay, well that's cool.
Because when I took the 3D class, I did a turret from Portal.
I remember that.
That was a really cute little thing you did.
And other people have done different... One person did a Game Boy Advance.
So I'm saying you get... There's definitely references.
I mean, a lot of the stories in there, there's definitely a few geeks doing the writing.
But I think that it's worthwhile.
So really that's what my... That and Umlaut have really been what's taken up the bulk of my week.
Not really specifically gaming, but...
It's been two worthy things that I'm proud to have been involved in this week.
And I swear, I waste so much time doing meaningless tasks like item management and what I can carry with me.
I was literally today spending time at the enchantment table or whatever to give my armor some extra lifting abilities so I can just carry more crap with me as I'm going around.
Um...
I did one of the quests which was, I think it was called A Night to Remember or something like that.
And where you get drunk and somehow end up on the completely other side of the world.
And that's kind of what happened.
And so I've been journeying my way back.
But thankfully I could fast travel back to Whiterun to dump my crap into a cabinet.
Which this cabinet must have an infinite amount of space because I...
It's a big cabinet.
What you don't see in Skyrim is that at the other end of the cabinet is the door to Narnia.
So you just have all of Narnia to store your shit.
It pretty much is like that.
And it was... BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Loki was lollygagging.
And it's funny, though, because I had to dump off... I had 150 carats.
150 carats for no reason whatsoever.
You wascally wabbit.
So the first thing I started doing was like, I'm going to eat all these cures right now!
So I was hammering down A, but it just took forever to do that.
Your skill in vitamin A has increased to 22.
So I decided...
I'm gonna make it rain!
So I ran upstairs into this, like, uh, in this general goods store.
I ran upstairs to the balcony, and I was gonna throw the carrots off the balcony and want to see, like, a pile of carrots.
And you get a carrot!
And you get a carrot!
And you get a carrot!
But, no, unfortunately, it doesn't do it like that.
You would have to drop each one individually, um, because otherwise it drops them in piles of, like, 109 and stuff.
It was very unepic, so, um...
So yeah, I didn't do that, but I don't know, I've just been playing a lot.
I think I actually looked at my play time, I have like 36 hours in the game, and I've done like nothing.
And I'm probably further progressed in the story than you.
I've done like hardly anything in there.
I like to find the random dungeons, but then I'm like, oh, I don't want to explore this dungeon because somebody in the nearby town might have a quest.
So I need to go to the quest and talk to everybody until I find the...
and then I'm picking every single fucking flower on the way because I can't stop this game is horrible for people who have I go in with the JRPG mindset from Final Fantasy gotta find every treasure box, gotta open everything gotta get every item, I want my perfect run through, 999 everything you take that mindset to Skyrim you are fucked, you'll never get anything done and you will have 150 carats in your goddamn bag because you picked every single one that's
I go through all the towns searching the barrels and I know very well that there's not gold in those barrels.
It's gonna be carrots or apples or tomatoes or maybe cabbage that's worth nothing.
Carrots are literally worth nothing.
You cannot sell them for any money whatsoever.
But you can eat them.
You can eat them or drop them on the ground.
You know that if you eat too many carrots it will turn you orange?
I shit you not that happened to me when I was two and I had to go to the ER.
It's actually happened to several famous people like one of them was what was her name that played the older sister on the Partridge Family?
I don't know.
Susan Day, wasn't that her?
Okay, sure.
But she ate nothing but carrots and they had to tell her to stop eating carrots because she turned orange on screen.
Come on, get orange.
Trivia.
If I'm ever on Useless Crap Jeopardy, I'll remember that.
I'm trying to think if there's any other funny stuff that's happened glitch-wise.
Because I know there has been.
Yeah, like exploring random things.
I went into a cottage and there was this really powerful wizard in the cottage that wanted to kill me.
I was like, okay.
Or the... There's like some sort of... There's like so many bands of like... I've lost track of like all the different groups in the games.
Like, you know, they have the Imperials and the Stormcloaks and then they have the... What was it?
The...
Followers, and then some other weird band that's somewhere else that has these weird bone weapons.
They apparently suck, though, because I kicked the crap out of them.
Yeah, so basically I played lots of Skyrim, didn't really do much in the game other than, you know, go around.
I did happen, though, I was walking along and I saw these people wandering.
They're traders that were bringing gifts for a wedding that was the cousin of some head of the trade council or something like that.
And so they're like...
and they're basically like oh you know we really should get on our way and then one of the options was I'm gonna take those gifts from you so that's one of the options I did and then I murdered them and stole their gifts and I'm not I think that's part of a quest but I'm not really sure okay last Skyrim thing and then we've got to move on okay someone actually did have a question what in the chat yeah did you offer the wizard carrots Loki except I think it's a statement because he didn't use any punctuation
No, I did not.
All right, I got to play this.
Bobby sent this to me.
He said don't play the sound, so I guess there's talking or whatever over it.
It's music.
It's funny.
Oh, you've heard this?
Yes.
He says it's 2,500 cheese wheels rolling off a mountain.
Let's see here.
It's awesome.
It's done with console commands.
Oh, there they all go.
That is a mountain of cheese.
See, that's the kind of epicness that I wanted with the carrots.
What about this?
4,200 cabbages going downhill in the related video.
Oh, there they go.
All the cabbages going downhill.
That's not Skyrim music.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
That's like techno porn music.
That's like porno music.
That's tech demo music, Rob.
If you like cabbages, if you like Skyrims, I got the video for you.
And then threw them off the mountain.
I can't fathom how that works.
Well, it's not like... It's pretty much what you think.
If you're playing an Xbox Live, there's single player and then there's Xbox Live.
So Xbox Live is the obvious mode, right?
You go in and it's just like the game.
And if you've never played the game before, you have green cards which have words like... They're like adjectives.
Like, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and like for example one of the red cards is Helen Keller and that will always win every round and I'm proud to say Helen Keller is in the apples to apples 360 game it had to be there so um you know if somebody plays the green card sassy and I play Helen Keller then somebody might you know pick that as the winner and then the winner gets a point and then whoever gets you know five ten points whatever the game's rules are first wins the game whoo
X-Box Live
I thought it was funny.
I'm like, I get it.
It's a joke.
But somebody else is like, whatever.
And it started this whole political discussion.
I'm just like, come on.
It's apples to apples, people.
This isn't fun.
What about the single player?
How the hell does that work?
The single player is Boggle.
You ever play Boggle?
Where you find the words in the mixed grid of letters.
And so in the first few levels, you're just trying to figure out what red card would the computer pick?
and it's really obvious.
It's all these big stereotypes.
The apple might be dressed up like a princess and so the card might be something like pretty and the cards you get are like nuclear war.
Oatmeal, and Diamonds.
And so a princess, of course, is going to pick Diamonds.
So you have to find in the board D-I-A-O-M and you spell out Diamonds.
It's kind of dumb.
That sounds like racial profiling to me.
A little bit.
It's stereotyping a lot.
Especially when you start getting into the Cowboys and the Hippies and all that stuff.
But anyway, it gets impossibly hard though when words just disappear from the red cards.
And now it'll be like the red card will be Rock and
question, question, question, question and so you have to look on the board and be able to find roll and know that it goes with rock and not only that you have to figure out which one of the three cards it's as impossible to figure out how to play as it is to figure out how I'm explaining it to you to be honest so single player gets weird fast
I honestly think Apples to Apples is only going to be fun if you have people to play it with.
And how much was it again?
$10.
And honestly, for that price, you should go to Target and actually buy Apples to Apples.
I mean, really.
You'll have more fun with real people than you will, I think, online.
Sorry to say.
but you know for I guess a card game going to a flash game from a technical perspective would be it integrates with Facebook if you want to spam your achievements for everybody I don't see every Xbox game doing that so I guess some people are into that alright since you brought up games that are party games that have been translated to the Xbox here's a challenge for indie developers out there that I think this would be perfect for an indie game because they sure as hell aren't going to bring the Xbox Live Arcade
EAT POOP YOU CAN'T
Apples.
And then the next person draws a picture of the phrase.
And then the person after that, the first phrase is hidden.
So all they see is the picture and they have to come up with a new caption for it.
And it goes on from there until... Especially when you get people that can't draw at all like me.
Yeah, it goes on from there.
But I think...
That'd be hilarious to do a game like that.
Maybe have Xbox Live support or something like that.
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom is going so far as to correct me and even saying, but Sky, it's $20 at Target.
It's double.
Well, hold on, AlphaKananagram.
I'm going to one-up you because if you want to play with your friend on Xbox, you both have to buy the game, so that's $10 each.
Ha-ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha.
And more if you have more friends.
Right.
So, anyhow.
I love that somebody actually went to look that up.
I'm going to hope he just bought that as a Christmas present for somebody recently or whatever it is he celebrates this time of year.
All right.
Anyhow, so there was that.
Other games I played this week.
Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS.
I'm going to say the exact same thing every other reviewer has said about Mario Kart 7.
You ready?
It's Mario Kart...
That's really an accurate description.
I mean, you know Mario Kart.
Anybody who's been playing games for a while knows Mario Kart.
It's the same game that was on the DS and it's on every Nintendo system and it's now on the 3DS.
The 3D is tasteful.
It's not over the top.
It's done fine.
It's fun to play with 3D.
The online works just like the Wii.
This almost essentially feels like a port of the Wii game to the 3DS but with some newer tracks.
I don't understand some of the online stuff they integrated.
Like my 3DS will randomly get these random ghosts, just seem to download from online.
Randomly random ghosts?
Yes, randomly random.
It's super random.
It's redundantly redundant?
And it'll be like, you just got a new ghost.
And I'll be like, oh, maybe I street passed with somebody or maybe somebody on my friends list just somehow sent me a ghost through the internet.
How cool.
And then I'll race against the ghost and it'll be like, you beat...
I'm gonna name my firstborn kanji text from Japan.
Shut up.
You can do community stuff.
So of course...
As we do for any new community thing that hits the internet, we have run and hurriedly set up the OL Army community.
I have no idea how community racing works, but from what I understand, there's like a top three for the month, and you can do all that.
So the friend code is posted on Twitter.
Twitter.com slash OL Army.
Sorry, community code.
It's different than a friend code.
The community code for the OL Army is posted on Twitter, and it's on our Facebooks as well.
And I'm sure somebody will post it and chat in a matter of minutes.
Add us, because live during the break tonight, I'm going to try and play it.
Now, I understand it might be an entire Grand Prix race, so I might have to drop, but I'll do at least a couple races with you guys during the midpoint break tonight.
I am planning on getting this game, and actually I'm also planning, not even planning, I am getting Super Mario 3D Land.
I will have it Friday.
TigerClaw in our chat says it's SpotPass.
Yeah, I know it's SpotPass, but it makes no sense.
Like, I get SpotPass in some of the other games I play, like Super Mario 3.
Ah, I know what it is.
It's all those Japanese developers that you StreetPassed with.
Didn't you, like, do some at E3?
Do you think because I've exchanged data with them before, like at E3, now I'm getting all their ghosts?
Really?
Yeah.
So I'm playing against Japanese developers and I'm kicking their ass?
Yeah!
Yeah, I think so.
I think if you cross-reference those ghosts with... Really?
Yeah.
Because that would be... That makes a lot of sense, actually.
That's kind of weird.
Interesting.
I know somebody who got Miyamoto's me at E3.
Wait, no, no, no.
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
It's just... The door is wide open for the jokes.
They might be easy to beat because they are of a certain nationality.
And they're not typically good drivers.
Racism fail.
Alright.
That's racism racing right there.
Stop.
All right.
But I will say this.
The other thing I got to say about Mario Kart 7 is that a lot of really good retro tracks came back, like Waluigi Pinball.
That track is so fun.
And some of the Wii tracks came back that are awesome, too.
Here's my gripe, and this has been since, like, I think even the NDS one.
All right.
What's up with them bringing back the most terrible tracks for Battle Mode?
Like, their decision, hey, from the 1064, let's bring back the big donut or something like that.
Like, one of the most...
They brought back Mario Circuit 2 from the original Super Nintendo game.
If I was going to bring back one of the courses from the Super Nintendo game, I would have brought back one of the Ghost Houses because those levels were epic.
I think they did that in the DS one, though.
Yeah, I know.
But it's like they picked these really random tracks that they bring back.
It's like, and you didn't want to bring back Blockfort or you didn't want to bring back, you know...
I don't remember the one that they had.
There was another one.
It was like a four-tiered one or a three-tiered one on the Nintendo 64 version.
That was pretty awesome.
But, oh, those are terrible.
We'll just bring back the donut or all the weird ones that they had on the Wii that just made no sense.
Alright, so that's Mario Kart 7.
It's Mario Kart, but it's... Look, if you have a 3DS already, you probably have already bought Mario Kart 7.
I don't know what else I can tell you.
If you've never played a Mario Kart game before, then go to a friend's house who has it and use Download Play, because you can do Download Play with one kart.
And there you go.
Instant demo.
Alright, one more.
You should have brought your system.
Alright.
One more game.
I Street Pass with people at Umlaut too.
I got like all these new houses in Mario 3D Land.
Toad houses and stuff.
So anyway.
One more game to talk about this week.
One more.
Unamas.
And it's a game that Loki loaned to me two weeks ago that I finally got around to playing this week.
Yes, I jumped in and I played Saints Row the Third.
Which is totally not the type of game I would ever imagine myself playing.
Because like, I get why people like Grand Theft Auto, but I'm always like...
I'd rather play a role playing game or something.
But I decided to approach Saints Row 3 with an open mind.
Or Saints Row the 3rd, excuse me, with an open mind.
And I gotta tell you,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And I gotta say, I'm actually really impressed at how well they integrate the whole create your own character and get it into the experience.
Because towards the beginning of the game, you're allowed to create whatever kind of character you want.
You can create boy, girl, big boobies, little boobies, fat, skinny...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and no matter what it is you pick, you're like fully integrated into the game as the leader of this gang.
So I decided to make my character, I made kind of like Pam Grier from a Blaxploitation film in the 70s if she had, well she did have gigantic titties, but like unrealistically big titties.
Because I took the tit meter as high as it would go and she's large and in charge.
and at first I was going to make her a grandma but I decided no I'm going to scale back the age a little bit so she's kind of like a husky kind of Pam Greer and it's like what I love about it is that it flows so well with the woman voice and everything like the way I know what you guys are thinking like what you're saying a woman can't be in charge or whatever but no what I'm saying is that it's almost like they've recorded everything seven or eight times or however many characters there are
To get the script to work And that's damn impressive That attention to detail On something so stupid But it pays off tremendously That attention to detail Pays off tremendously I was laughing so fucking hard I was crying during that airplane sequence Where my character gets sucked out the door So her fat ass is rolling down The little chute And then there's skydiving or whatever And there's this whole skydiving sequence And you're literally freaking
You gotta remember, to put this in perspective
Last week, or the week before, I was talking about White Knight Chronicles 2 on the PlayStation 3, where you also create a character, but your character never talks, your character is a bystander, your character isn't integrated into the story at all.
I'm not saying this makes White Knight Chronicles a bad game, but when you put that side by side with the lengths that they've gone to integrate whatever it is you want...
Thanks for watching!
You're listening to the radio and Sublime's What I Got comes on the radio.
And you and your gang member that you're driving with start singing along to the song.
Like, Loving is what I got.
And they're singing it the way people in that role would really sing it.
You know, like there's a line in the song that goes like, But I can still get high.
And like my character shouts like, You know it!
Like it's...
it's little things like that that just put this game in a caliber where it's like you really like I think you have to experience it like I Loki you're right it's games hilarious and it's fun to play okay I'm gonna have to play it it only gets better it's just you think that the whole airplane thing was ridiculous let me put this way have you seen the new the new 18 movie
No, I haven't seen the new A-Team movie, sorry.
Okay, well, there's... Let me put it this way.
The first skydive sequence reminded me a lot of Shoot Em Up, the Clive Owen movie.
Spoiler, there is a second skydive sequence at one point that reminds me a lot of the A-Team, where they try to fly a tank.
Just...
I can't stress, and no, somebody in the chat room asked, Ranma asked if I gave my character an afro.
No, I did, I gave her the long flowing hot black hair to go, she's got the volume.
You gave her the Beyonce hair.
Voluminous.
No, she has voluminous hair.
Kind of a modern, modern day Jackie Brown, Pam Greer looking thing.
But just...
My character is so sassy and that's what I wanted her to be and it's great.
I did play some more Saints Row the Third this week.
I forgot.
We've been playing Horde mode during our lunch breaks.
Horde mode is pretty fun on its own actually.
It's just really ridiculous some of the stuff that they have.
DarkSakura
So you really think we should do that?
I don't want to play a zombie.
If I play it, I want to make my type of character.
And the zombie will sing what I got as well.
Travis Donovan over at Understation Live made me.
He's been playing through the game as me.
And apparently I like to run around.
Apparently I do this in real life with hot pink bunny slippers and a Hello Kitty backpack.
Because that's what the me character in the game has.
But...
I imagine the game is hilarious still because you're playing this guy and, you know, probably still really funny with all the outfits.
So just don't expect – like you got to put a game like Saints Row the Third side by side with Skyrim.
And they couldn't – they're so different.
But they're both like open world games and so forth.
And I think it's just one of those things where it's like –
Like, Skyrim is the Oscar-nominated picture you see at the arthouse movie, which is a great experience, and you'll just, you'll be, you know, happy to have witnessed it.
Okay, it's basically, it's Lord of the Rings and fucking Transformers, I mean, that's...
Except Transformers wasn't actually good.
Saints Row the Third is like getting high and going to see Pink Floyd's The Wall set to the lasers.
Would it be the difference between watching Lord of the Rings and Friday?
Yes!
That's a great analogy.
Friday is also an amazing movie, right?
It's hilarious, but not for the same reasons.
Friday's just fucking funny, right?
That's a great analogy.
I would compare it to, like, Lord of the Rings and the movie Shoot Em Up.
Shoot Em Up is seriously...
This game follows that movie.
There's a lot of stuff that they took straight out of it.
Just ridiculous action sequences.
The whole intro is seriously ripped off of that movie, but I don't care because it's awesome.
Alright, let's go to one question from the chatroom and then we gotta get to gaming news.
It's been like an hour and we're still talking about our gaming weeks.
TigerClaw says, makes you wonder, if they were ever to make a Saints Row movie, would it be an action comedy?
Okay, look, whoever does the Saints Row movie, which I am all for at this point.
I absolutely think they should make a Saints Row movie.
And I think it should be over the top stupid funny.
Like, it needs to be like Airplane, okay?
So I think the Zucker Brothers should do the Saints Row movie.
Okay.
They need to just incorporate Leslie Nielsen in there somewhere.
He's dead.
Even though he's dead.
I know, but I mean, it doesn't matter.
He could be the zombie boss.
It doesn't matter.
They could, you know, work him in.
It's true.
Through technology these days.
Exactly.
Well, if they could do, you know, what was that last Bruce Lee movie where he's dead halfway through filming it?
Zether in our chatroom says, I thought you guys were talking about the song Friday.
Still an accurate comparison.
Lord of the Rings.
Rebecca Black's Friday with 17 gazillion YouTube views.
Alright, look.
So that was my gaming week.
Saints Row the Third.
Hilariously stupid.
Hilarious.
Alright, and I will play more of it because I just, I laugh consistently when I'm playing that game and I think that's so important.
So, alright.
Sometimes you want Final Fantasy, sometimes you want dick and fart jokes.

We are on Facebook.
Upcoming show schedule.
We will be here next week on the 18th.
We will not be here on the 25th, although some alternative thing might go on on the 25th, like online or something.
I don't know.
I got a milkshake!
Where's mine?
Alright, just kidding.
Anyway, I had Starbucks on the way here, if you can't tell.
I'm wired on coffee today.
On the 1st, we should have a show.
As of right now, it looks like we will have a show on the 1st.
I don't know of anybody who doesn't, can't, or whatever, be here on the 1st.
So I think we're doing a show then.
Which is the exact opposite of Bobby, who comes on before us.
Bobby's going to do a show Christmas night.
So spend your Christmas with Bobby here on All Games Radio, and then spend your New Year's with us.
We'll ring in 2012.
Okay, let's get into the gaming news.
Surprisingly enough, for this time of year, when everybody's getting ready to go on holiday breaks and everything, there's a lot of damn gaming news going on, right?
Loki, start us off.
Yeah, well, this week they had the VGAs, the Spike Video Game Awards show.
And, of course, with the VGAs, there's a lot of... Do you watch the VGAs?
Nope.
No, me neither.
I don't even have to ask Jamie.
I'll just watch the trailers afterwards.
Why am I going to waste time?
Thank you, TigerClaw.
It was game of death.
Everything I've heard about the VGAs online was that people felt their IQs dropping rapidly as they were watching it.
As if anybody should be surprised.
It's Spike, no offense, but...
I mean, they have GameTrailersTV, and GameTrailers did a lot of the trailer stuff.
They have it hosted on their site.
It's just like watching GTTV, because it's really late, and obviously I don't watch it then.
But I'll just catch it when the trailers come online the next day.
And that's kind of what happened, for the most part.
um so one of they of course announced they tease and they announce a lot of games um during the show so one of the games of course that's been you know talked about for a while Metal Gear Solid Rising well now apparently Metal Gear Solid Rising is now Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance which almost sounds like a made up word but I'm it's vengeance subtitles are cool it's vengeance but revengeance hey it's called a portmanteau
Kunju Tite.
It's a combination of two words, duh.
Really, I think the reason they have to add the subtitle in the first place is because it's going to be a series, would be my guess.
But yeah, it's now actually being worked on by Platinum Games.
Of course, the company responsible for such wonderful things like Bayonetta or Mad World or...
Oh, what was the other one?
Which, funny enough, coming off the Saints Row third discussion is kind of in that same bucket where Bayonetta, again, sometimes you just want a big stupid action movie and don't get me wrong, Bayonetta is great.
Bayonetta would make an awesome movie and they have to.
If a Bayonetta movie ever happens, Joe Pesci better fucking be in that movie because if there's no Joe Pesci... He's almost too old.
They gotta hurry.
No, no, no, he can do it.
No, they need Mark Shepard.
Who?
Mark Shepard.
Who's he?
You don't want Supernatural.
Of course I don't.
He plays Crowley.
I'm a 30-year-old male.
There's nothing in Supernatural for me.
He would be perfect for that role.
Fair enough.
Except Joe Pesci is that role.
When I played the game, I thought Joe Pesci too.
But if Joe Pesci was too old, then I guess whoever DarkSakura is talking about.
so but that'd be that'd be awesome but anyways yeah it's not a lot of details are you know released about this yet other than the fact that you know new studios working on it now and also it's supposed to take place now in the time period after Metal Gear Solid 4 and I guess you're gonna be doing like mercenary work for different people and stuff I heard um it's getting a lot of flack from the Metal Gear community because it's not a true quote-unquote Metal Gear game
But I'm kind of like, well, I mean, they've done a lot of spin-off Metal Gear games.
And in my opinion, you know, I was kind of like, oh, okay, whatever about this game.
But now that I hear that the Bayonetta folks are involved, I've perked up a little bit.
And I'm like, oh, they're serious about making an action Metal Gear game at this point.
Because, you know, Bayonetta was a heck of a game.
So I'm kind of interested in this, like, way more than I was before, which was only a little bit.
So...
These things are going to happen.
Are you going to be completely denied a Metal Gear Solid 5 because of this game?
I don't think so.
It'll happen eventually.
Kojima's even said that they're going to be doing a 5.
He knows that people want a 5.
Actdeft in our chatroom says simply, I kind of agree.
If the fans of Metal Gear or whatever don't want it, then don't buy it.
More for me.
Alright, well, we were talking about the new Xbox Live dashboard that rolled out this week and you might have not noticed this, but thankfully the internet was there to help you out.
The terms of service for Xbox have recently updated where now you will not be able to essentially sue Microsoft as part of a class action agreement anymore.
You might remember this conversation from a few months ago when Sony did the same thing in their terms of service.
Except there's kind of a difference and that is that, you know, Sony had that whole hack thing that went on a while ago and like actually had a reason that people might want to file a class action lawsuit.
But Microsoft, to our knowledge, hasn't had anything happen.
But then there's that part of me that goes, well...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I don't know, it's interesting.
Would you really go to a court and actually start a lawsuit against them?
I think if you're going to start a lawsuit against Microsoft, just do it on your own.
I understand class action lawsuits are just so... I think a lot of the class action lawsuits are started by these lawyers that just want to make some money.
And they just send out a blanket notice to everybody and they're like, hey, money's coming your way.
And you're like, woohoo!
I don't have to do shit, you know, and I get free money.
I mean, I think that's what happened with like Grand Theft Auto.
I don't even know if I ever got a check for Grand Theft Auto.
I don't really care because I still had Grand Theft Auto and I wasn't going to, you know, San Andreas, the first issue with the hot coffee stuff in there.
Yeah, it's a collector's item now.
I mean, I don't know.
It's just kind of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
If you really feel like you've been wronged, you should have the right to take them to a legal court.
Isn't that granted in the Constitution?
If you have a settlement that's more than $20 in value, you have a right to a trial by jury?
Well, I think that they're actually...
They're going to be doing some sort of... I want to say there's been some court cases or places in the United States that have found that those arbitration things can't be upheld in court or something.
It's kind of like on both sides.
I think there's been some cases that have gone in the favor of the whole arbitration clauses and some against it.
It's just which one has precedence or not.
All right, anyhow, I do want to point out, this is important, you can't opt out of this, by the way.
If you want to keep using Xbox Live, you cannot opt out of this.
There was some rumor going around at first that it kind of had the postcard thing going on, but actually what's going on is that you can reject future changes to the arbitration agreement, but you cannot decline this one.
So if you don't like it, you've got to stop using Xbox Live.
And I've got to get this out here.
This is the one other big thing I do not like about this.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I'm sure that they've got it in the small text or whatever before when you're paying for your life that we can change this at any time, you know, and without notice and blah, blah, blah.
They have their lawyers covering their asses for this shit.
Some states are taking action against these things, too.
So, you know, maybe a matter of time before these types of agreements are illegal anyway.
But, I mean, look at it this way.
I mean, honestly, I mean, look at...
Are any of you really going to just go after Microsoft and actually file a lawsuit?
I think not, for the most case.
If they do something to you that really pisses you off, here's how you take care of it later on.
You don't buy their next console.
You just say...
whatever if you smear them on the internet like everyone else does or yes smear them on the internet well i'm just like seriously if it's if it's so bad that you actually have to go and file a lawsuit against you know whatever company maybe microsoft sony nintendo whoever um if it's they're pissing you off that much that you just like i gotta go file a lawsuit against them then just don't buy their product that's true kick them where it counts in the wallet
I mean, because a lot of people may go that route if there's something like, you know, if it comes out 45 days later, they're like, oh, you had to sign this arbitration clause and there's been this massive leak that you've been, you know, covering up.
Trust me, they'll get it in the end.
You know, someone will investigate and say, hey, what the fuck?
You know, why are you having these people sign this?
Oh, because you knew that you were going to get sued.
So, I mean...
I mean, just like, you know, people were worried about buying the 360 back when the whole Red Ring, you know, was going around.
By the way, I was at a Target the other day with a new Xbox, one of the newer ones, Red Ringed E68.
Not Red Dot, excuse me, the Red Dot of Death with an E68 error.
Hilarious.
Problem's still not gone.
Just saying.
Yeah.
Alright, anyhow, so there you have it.
Take it or leave it.
Get off Xbox Live, I guess, if you don't like it at this point, but I don't know.
At the end of the day, if I get pissed off enough...
that agreement ain't gonna stop me and I don't think it can I think that's only about class that's a class action waiver if me as an individual wants to sue Microsoft I believe I can still do that I don't think anybody can take that right away no it would be highly illegal but they're just gonna make it very fucking difficult to do that yeah of course they just keep up in the it's just another case of the big guys big companies trying to you know but Rob corporations are people anyway alright let's move on
Well, um, Epic.
We know Epic, don't we?
Well, um, they've announced a game for the Vita.
The PS Vita, sorry.
Um, and it is a zombie game called Fortnite.
F-O-R-T-N-I-T-E.
And, um, there wasn't actually any gameplay shown in the trailer, but it said that it showed all the characters picking up trash and scrap metal and bringing it back, and then the zombies show up.
So basically, from what I understand is that it's preparing for a zombie assault and then the zombies come and you survive the assault.
That would be awesome if it was like Junkyard Wars meets a zombie apocalypse.
More info in a fortnight.
Ugh.
Thanks for watching!
by Bioware, Command & Conquer Generals 2.
I almost forgot that there was a Command & Conquer Generals game.
But it's set to come out 2013 on PC exclusively.
It's going to be using the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which you may remember from Battlefield 3, which looked pretty awesome.
So...
Very cool to check it out.
I did not play the first Generals game, but I know it was a little bit different than the regular Command & Conquer game because I believe it was one where you're actually... If I remember correctly, you're actually playing as one of the troops kind of on the ground, and you can still kind of control different things as well, but it's not just like an RTS game like before, if I remember correctly.
I could be wrong, though.
There might...
Maybe another Command & Conquer game that was also along the lines of that.
It's very interesting to me that they are going PC only with this, especially with some developers saying we'll never make PC games again.
I think it's just mainly because Command & Conquer is not very popular on consoles, actually.
It's just really more of a PC game.
It just hasn't done well when they've brought the last few to consoles.
Makes sense.
It's like Civilization, maybe, that it doesn't...
I was going to say it doesn't translate well to consoles, but I actually think that Civilization Revolution game was pretty good for a console game.
But it was a scaled-back experience, so it wasn't the same Civilization you really get on PC.
It would be a good game, I think, RTS-wise, it would be a good game for the Wii U. I think RTS games translate well for the Wii U with...
You know, touch screen and you can move stuff around that way.
That'd be kind of cool.
Because it'd be like playing, what was it?
There was a Tom Clancy's... The Tom Clancy game, not End War, but it was...
and Ruse where they had that actually playable on Microsoft Surface systems and you could you know mess around with that.
It'd be kind of similar to playing it on like a Surface or something but you'd be playing it with the tablet if you will.
So I could see RTS is coming over there but yeah it's just going to be right now PC only and you know if it does well on PC they may decide to try it again on consoles but as of right now it's just PC and 2013 is when you can expect that.
As a Command & Conquer fan, are you going to pick this up?
No, I haven't played Command & Conquer.
It's the series' first Red Alert game.
I mean, that's how long ago it's been.
That is a long time ago.
All right.
Well, I'm going to one more game that was announced at the...
The Last of Us The Last of Us
I don't know what kind of game they're going for.
If it's survivable horror or action, I think it's supposed to be a hybrid of the two.
To me, the trailer, and I'm going to play a little bit of the trailer here so at least you get some of the audio.
The trailer to me looked a little bit like a mixture between, what's that Will Smith movie where he's alone in the world after the outbreak?
I Am Legend.
Thank you.
It looks like I Am Legend mixed with a father-daughter bonding thing going on here.
Oh, Daddy, you killed him just fine.
Well, she kills one here later on in the trailer.
There's kind of one coming up here.
I'm proud of you, baby.
And she looks like the girl from Juno, which is a little weird to me.
Is it just me?
But you know the premise of this, right?
It's that bacteria, fungus, or whatever that they have in the rainforest that takes over actual...
and insects or whatever and infects their brain and then they eventually, I think, die.
It controls their body almost.
Wasn't that the plot to I Am Legend?
No, I Am Legend was vampires.
Or was that 28 Days Later?
28 Days Later was zombies.
I'm sorry, it was a disease, but it's zombies.
Okay, so it's 28 Days Later mixed with I Am Legend mixed with Juno.
Okay.
I guess the graphics look good.
If that really is real-time rendering or whatever, then it looks really good.
Now, just because it's coming from a PlayStation 3 system, I kind of go, well, it could be just a Blu-ray movie.
But if that is really in real-time being developed by the engine, that's, I gotta say, a good-looking game.
Uncharted 3 is a pretty sexy looking game, so I can believe that that's real time.
Okay, point taken.
And this is, by the way, just referencing Bobby's show earlier this evening, this is why he calls the game The Last of Us.
Because Office is all one word looking there.
No, it's not.
Yes, I can see that the kerning between the F and the U... Hey, you used the right term!
Speaking of FU...
You know what?
But you did use the right term.
Once in a while, DarkSakura, this might shock you, once in a while, I have a smart moment.
You know what I would have done though?
What?
I would have moved the S, actually I would have kerned it a little bit differently so that the space where the T and the S would have been exactly the same.
And that would have looked really hot.
Hey, guess what?
Hire me, people!
I'm a good designer, really.
Hey, guess what?
What?
No one ker.
Alright.
You know what I would have done differently?
I would have called it The Happening 2 because that's really kind of what it is.
It's plants taking over people.
Plants versus zombies!
Actually, you know what?
The Happening...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wait, I just said more realistic?
I'm sorry, it's an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
It's not realistic at all.
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com says, Every game could be better with Tim Curry in it.
I don't know where that comes from, but yes, that would be absolutely true.
In fact, if Pennywise the Clown was in this game, it would be the scariest video game of all time, quite possibly.
You know what?
That just means he's a good actor.
No, no, no, no, no.
Tim Curry, I'm fine with.
Some of the scariest characters from your childhood were Tim Curry.
Think about it.
Pennywise the Clown, Darkness from Legend, Dr. Frankenfurter, Rooster from Annie.
I mean...
Thanks for watching!
That would be awesome.
That's right.
It would be so random.
As part of the marketing plan, they should never show who the leader of the gang is in any of the trailers.
Just leave it up to the movie and people find out it's Tim Curry.
You know what?
He should be in the snazziest suit and everything.
Except they finally show his feet and it's nine inch heels.
All right, look, moving on.
We got another story.
I do want to tease this, though, because we're getting towards the end of part eight, and this is important.
If you have Mario Kart 7, get your 3DS out, go to twitter.com slash OLR, or maybe somebody in chat will yell it out again, add us to your community list.
DarkSakura.com
Dr. Who, The Eternity Clock
and hopefully there are some Cybermen and Daleks in it because it's not a Doctor Who thing without Cybermen and Daleks eventually showing up in some form or another.
Actually, I bet it's going to have the silence in it even though the silence did get totally... Oh, no, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
But it's being built by Supermassive Games.
They're the ones who did Sackboy's prehistoric moves for LittleBigPlanet 2.
And if there's a PC version, I really hope they do it for Steam.
Now wouldn't that be awesome if they had like a little big planet to download content pack that was the doctor?
That would be awesome.
But then he'd just walk around sonic screwdrivering everything and doing his timey-wimey stuff.
I want a TARDIS.
I have a TARDIS.
I totally want this game.
You know, one of our listeners in the UK sent me a Doctor Who game a while back.
Yeah, I remember that.
And it wasn't very good from what I remember.
It was Top Trumps or whatever the card game is.
It was pretty fun.
It actually was really fun.
It's just I had no idea how to play when I first played it.
It was so foreign.
It was so, so un-American.
No, I'm kidding.
No, it was actually pretty fun, but it had Martha in it, so I had to gag a little bit.
All right, we're going to travel around the world and check out release dates, although we're getting to that time of year where if it was going to come out, it's out.
But there's some coal at the bottom of the stocking if you dig enough.
Right, Loki?
Yeah, let me see if I can do this all in one breath because it's very, very small.
All right, here we go.
U.S.
states.
Here we go.
All right, we have Outdoor Unleashed, Alaska and Africa on the 3DS, Dr. Lork and the Forgotten Knights on the 3DS, and I Heart Geeks on the Nintendo DS.
Well, this is a big week for DS people.
That was it.
What's iHeartGeeks?
iHeartGeeks is something that's from... Remember Mark Echo and the crappy Getting Up game?
Well, Mark Echo is now providing some stuff for this iHeartGeeks.
It's like, I think, The Incredible Machine or something.
That was an epic game on the PC.
Yeah, it was an epic game.
They kind of beat it into the ground.
It's just not quite as cool anymore.
I like the box art.
It's cute.
I don't even think they even have a trailer for it.
But yeah, it's got some artwork by Mark Echo, and that's about it.
All right, well, let's go over to Japan and check out some release dates in Japan.
I got to say it's... Oh, and I'm sorry, the Oregon Trail 3DS, because I got delayed a week.
Ah, you screwed up.
That wasn't one breath.
All right.
Well, I said it last week, so that's all right.
I got to say, for those of you that like to import your games, especially we'll get to PlayStation 3 in a minute here, because PS3 is a region free and all.
Thanks for watching!
Final Fantasy XIII-2 here in the States will be coming out on the 31st of January Not a bad delay all things considered And BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend would be on the 22nd I believe of February
Now, PlayStation 3 in Japan has some of the similar stuff.
They also have Final Fantasy XIII too, but they're also getting a whole darn console in the Final Fantasy XIII too style, which is weird to me, because they did one for the Final Fantasy XIII, and I would think any Final Fantasy person probably already bought it back then, but maybe, I don't know, I guess this one's a slim, so maybe...
Umeneko no Naku Koro Nisan Shinzutsu to Gensu no Yasuyoku
I'm reading the description here.
Take another step closer to the truth.
The game Battler plays with Beatrice is coming to an end in Shinsutsu to Gensou no Yasukyo.
I'm trying to think if this is something that... I'm trying to think if this is something that exists here.
Oh, it's another raising game.
Another sim.
That may very well be...
Oh, what the hell?
They just announced a sequel to it too.
It was a PlayStation 3 only game.
There's chocolate cake involved, I can see from one of the screenshots here.
Chocolate cake.
This game actually has cake, unlike Portal.
Well, it's described as having vivid character illustrations and atmospheric music.
Soundtrack with 80 pieces of music in the game.
So there you go.
That is coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
So a more exciting week over Japan.
I thought it was the game with the Soul Breed system.
I can't remember what the hell it was called.
I just set the item too this week, but yeah, that really stuck in my mind.
Can I get this out though?
Do you know what else makes this week exciting in Japan?
Way more exciting than here?
The PlayStation Vita is unleashed on December 17th So before we have our next show, the Vita will be out somewhere in the world And of course, lots and lots and lots of launch games I don't really have time to read through them all But the Vita and all its games are out this week Record of the Agorist War But I don't think that I don't know if that was Record of the Agorist War 2 Which is technically the third game Because the second game was the prequel
I'll tell you some of the games that are jumping out at me on the Vita.
BlazBlue has a Vita port as well which would explain why the release of the console ones is staggered a little bit.
Katamari Damacy has a Vita game coming out.
That I would recommend at launch because it's cheaper and it also has new levels and apparently it's pretty fun to play.
Michael Jackson
Ridge Racer Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Uncharted Golden Abyss Vita's got a really strong launch in Japan.
Also a Squeenix game called Lord of Apocalypse.
That's supposed to be awesome looking.
That's like half the games coming out.
So it's going to be interesting to see how the launch compares to the 3DS launch when 3DS didn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's a lot stronger now.
The PSP is not forgotten.
Just for DarkSakura, they are releasing on the PSP.
It's actually the DarkSakura edition.
No, I'm just kidding.
But it is Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd Low Price Edition.
Yay!
Budget Bin Edition.
Woo!
trying to look at the Nintendo systems real quick seeing what the 3DS is countering with this week against the Vita Puyo Puyo Anniversary Pins Collection and Inazuma 11 Go Dark version and Shine version both are out this week from level 5
That's a sports game.
Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.
So a very busy week in Japan.
Not so busy in the UK.
On the 12th we have Gears of War 3, Ram's Shadow.
On the 13th is Flat Out 3, Chaos and Destruction for PC.
And also on the PC on the 15th of December is X3, Albion Prelude.
That's about it.
I can't tell you what's coming out the week after that, though.
The Old Republic.
All right.
We're going to get into some more news here in just a minute.
We're actually, just for the podcast, folks, we lost our live feed.
Winamp crashed.
That happens a lot lately around here.
Freaking Winamp.
I can't figure out what's going on.
If it's not Comcast, it's Winamp.
I think they're in cahoots.
They're in cahoots.
Perhaps.
I love that word, Kahoot.
Making new versions of Winamp?
I think they do still make versions of Winamp.
But anyway, we should be reconnected, so apologies to the live listeners, and hopefully we didn't lose you guys during the... I don't know how long we were down.
I was so into reading those Japanese releases that Winamp could have been down for five minutes for all I know, so I apologize.
Rob was really looking at it with such intensity on his face that I thought he was going to pop a vein.
Seriously?
Alright, wow.
I think it was down for some time.
Sorry, guys.
Rob Vail, Fired
No, you're not fired.
Or you're rehired.
I could fire you once and then rehire you.
Alright.
Let's move on with some more gaming news now that we have our live listeners back.
Sorry, you just missed the release dates.
Sorry.
Yeah, there's like not much coming out.
No, there's a shit ton in Japan.
US and UX, UK, not so much.
Japan has the Vita release and a bunch of other stuff to go with it.
People in Japan, send Jamie a Vita so she can review it and talk about you.
I thought about buying a Vita from Japan and I saw that it was $600 and I'm like, fuck that.
Ooh.
No way.
I'm sorry.
All right.
A couple more news stories for you guys.
Then the classic game of the week and, of course, our Mario competition soon.
So Capcom is actually bringing over some Japanese indie games to PC for North America and Europe.
And they're going to be doing some cool stuff.
This is with a partnership deal with New Media, NYU, not New.
And I guess they're going to be doing some neat, like, a lot of, they call them retro chic arcade shooters.
For example, they've got, looks like Satsa, I can't even pronounce this, Satasius.
Satasius?
Satasius, yes.
That's going to be coming out.
That's available, I guess, as well on December 20th via Steam, Direct2Drive, GamersGate, and other major digital distribution services for $6.
And then coming early 2012, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, Ether Vapor Remaster, Fighting Fairy, Exceed Second, Vampire Rex, and Exceed Third, Jade Penetrate Black Package.
I'd play Fighting Fairy and I'm going to take a wild guess and say those probably the last two there are shmup games because it kind of sounds very you're a shmup and yes I would be accurate on that usually very complicated titles Cherry Tree High Comedy Club if that's a shmup I'm going to laugh nope of course not but that would be a funny name for a shmup Fighting Fairy is the best name ever
FightingFairy
Alright, moving on to just one more story here and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
But first I want to talk about Dogs and Cats Living Together, Mass Hysteria, OMG, a Microsoft app on an iOS device that makes it look like a Windows phone, sort of.
What?
Here's the deal.
My Xbox Live is a new app that is on the iOS App Store, and it's a way for you to integrate with the new Xbox.
And this is nice because there were some fan-created apps or whatever or unofficial apps that were decent.
But now we have something kind of official, and you can get on this app, and you can see what friends are online, what they're playing, compare achievements, all that stuff.
And what I think is kind of neat, you can send messages.
You can actually send messages through the app to people on their Xbox.
Okay.
Can you play with your avatar?
So, like, if Loki isn't listening... I think you can actually customize your avatar on that, too.
You can, you can.
Downloading.
If Loki isn't listening to you because he's too busy throwing carrots in Skyrim, you can actually pop it up on his screen through your iOS phone.
Stop throwing carrots, damn it!
Stop the carrots and pick up the phone and call me, or something, you know, something like that.
So that's pretty cool.
And you can also delete friends from your phone.
Woo-hoo!
Yay!
All these people I don't know.
The app is free.
So there you go.
I should go download it now.
And the app is also available on Windows phones.
Of course.
Of course.
But it was just kind of funny that it made its way to the iOS app as well.
And I believe the Windows phone app will do slightly more.
I think you can actually look through the catalogs of movies and apps and all that.
You can queue up movies and control your Xbox using that.
IOS App
BlackWolf says it's sluggish even on an iPad 2.
Makes me sad.
No voice messages.
That's true.
You can't do voice messages.
I just realized this recently, but the Kinect wires your whole damn room as a microphone.
I can't find the charger for my little wireless headset I had for my Xbox so I have no headset right now because the cat ate Alan's so all we have is the Kinect and when I'm playing Apples to Apples I can just talk to people You can't find the charger?
I think I have a spare headset That would be awesome The cats apparently live on a diet of headphone wires and treats They do it when we go to Disneyland and don't take them That's how they act out
My cat likes to eat our artificial tree.
She's just gnawing on it with the cords and stuff.
It reminds me of Christmas Vacation with the cat chewing on the cords and plugging in, hey, the Christmas tree's off.
I don't think they chewed on anything when I cat sat last time.
DarkSakura will dive into the vault headfirst and find a classic game that she says, Hey!
Listen up, you kids, with your Skyrim and your I-can't-believe-it's-not-Microsoft-on-an-Apple-phone-stuffs.
You need to go back to simpler times.
We didn't have no cell phone to manage friends lists.
We didn't have friends lists.
Yeah, we just had friends.
Back in the days of the Genesis.
Yeah, we didn't play online.
We just had people at our house and they ate all our pizza.
So Dark Sakura, if the kids today want to know what life was like back then, she's going to handpick one game that she thinks your kids should play.
Dark Sakura, what is the classic of the week this week?
Magic Knight Rayearth
Okay, that's enough.
Play the Japanese one now.
That music's gonna make me poop.
Alright, here's the Japanese one.
Come on.
There you go.
Isn't that better?
Not really.
She sounds more like a cat in that one.
Well, okay.
Anyway.
They had an even worse version.
And people complained so much.
What, the German one?
No.
Just play music from the game.
Alright, fine.
Here is music from Magic Knight Raid.
Well, anyway, there was a big anime series called Magic Knight Rayearth, which was really awesome.
The game was one of the pet projects of Working Designs.
And it was the last Saturn game that was released in the United States.
And it actually did not get localized for Europe.
So this was a really, really big deal when it came out.
Especially since Working Designs put so much effort into everything.
But at any rate, as far as an RPG goes, it was actually a very fun little RPG.
You had different puzzles, and you sort of played as a tag team of your three main characters.
You had Hikaru, Umi, and Fu.
Basically, they got kidnapped into Sephiroth to save the world as the Magic Knights.
If you haven't seen the anime, then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because it's based off the anime, of course.
So you upgrade through story progression.
However, you do get HP and MP.
You know, your hit points and magic points are increased by finding items.
But most of the character progress is done through story progression.
Okay.
It had really decent voice acting, I thought.
It was all people from Redding, by the way.
Did you know that?
Because Working Designs is based out of Redding.
Really?
Yep.
There ain't shit in Redding.
You know what else?
What?
Our Twilight Zone pinball was owned by the head of Working Designs.
Oh, awesome.
We got it from him.
That's why we have one of the Goemon dolls from the game that never came out.
Anyway, back to this.
They have different weapons, each of the Magic Knights does.
Hikaru has fire magic and she has a sword.
Umi uses a fencing foil and her powers are all water and ice.
I mean, her name is Umi, which means sea.
and, uh, who is a bow and arrow and wind and healing power.
So pretty cool.
Um, who actually I think is probably one of the most useful, you know, cause when she gets her upgrade, um, she has this lock on arrow thing.
So it's pretty cool.
So anyway, with the game that came out, Working Designs put a lot of effort into it, as they do with most everything they put out, because they've done a lot of treasure games, they've done a lot of Sega CD RPGs that we never thought that we would get.
So when they did this, they actually, for the whole opening sequence, they did, for anyone who's seen the anime, the logo is formed out of these gems, and
and so they had a new logo made in English that came the same way except Media Blasters had the rights to Rare at the time they designed their own logo and so they had to use that one.
The other problem too is that most of the source code for the Japanese version was lost due to a hard drive crash.
They had to rebuild the game.
Wow.
Yeah, so the code that they were missing had to be completely rebuilt, like I just said.
They did three different versions of the opening song.
They were not allowed to use the original for the English release.
So they had one with completely different lyrics.
They had the one that's in the game, and then there was an instrumental.
And, um, but the CD that came out with everything had all the different versions on it.
There was one that was just really hideous, by the way.
So yeah, there were other Rayearth games for the record.
There was a Game Boy one that was Rayearth 2nd, The Missing Colors.
Mahokishi Rayearth 2nd, The Missing Colors is what it was.
The Super Famicom, and two for the Game Gear.
The second one was called Making a Magic Knight.
But the only one that came out in the U.S.
was the Saturday game.
I have to say, because I've played through some of the Japanese ones, and I've played the entirety of the U.S.
ones.
And there was a big improvement made, and I'll tell you what it was.
In the Japanese one, every time you walked up to an item, and it does this in the US one, you've got dialogue, they make a comment on everything, except in the Japanese one, they said their comment too.
And it's like, wait to load, wait to load, wait to load.
They really fixed some of the loading time issues.
And on top of that, the packaging was amazing, and each of the desks, um, well, I would say that they had three different variations of the desks, one with Hikaru, one with Mii, one with Fu on it.
And I think I have the Mii one?
I think my friend has the Hikaru one.
Oh, Hikari, sorry.
Um, but anyway, um...
It was really good.
I mean, there were a lot of people who just thought it was kind of dull, you know, because, I mean, it was a three-year-old game when it came out over here.
But I think that if you're into a classic and fun RPG, this one's definitely one to check out if you can find it.
That's the other thing.
It was the last Saturn game released in the U.S.
It might be hard to find.
Slightly.
Slightly.
All right.
We can... It wasn't bad.
All right, there it is.
Your classic game of the week.
It wasn't bad.
Magic Knight Rayearth for the Saturn.
I did not know that they were all based in Reading.
You know what else is in Reading?
Trees.
And lots of them.
Alright, we are going to take a quick break here.
And it's going to go down in Mario Kart right now.
Get your DS's open.
Connect to the OL Army room.
Hopefully you've already added it there.
And we're going to get it started.
We're going to start it live here in just a minute.
But I'm going to break for the podcasties.
Put in a quick little break.
And we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Don't go anywhere though, guys.
We've got plenty more coming up in Part B tonight.
We've got The Last Story is coming to Europe.
And we're going to talk more about that and what it could possibly mean for America.
and of course a long time coming mailbag and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live with the second half of our 438th episode for this December the 11th of 2011.
Alright, I know you're all dying to know how the Mario Kart match with the whopping four people that joined in time went.
Okay, so first race, I got last place.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for most of the race.
For most of the race.
But then I did a stupid thing and I tried to take the detour over to the big ramp, but you really, we were in the Calamari, or was it Calamari?
Cala something desert level with the train.
It's from the Nintendo 64 one.
And I tried to take the shortcut, but the shortcut only works if you have a mushroom.
And Black Wolf pulled ahead of me by mere inches and won the whole thing.
Curse you, Black Wolf!
Curse you!
so but I got second place at least although somebody I think was Zether or somebody damn near took over right there at the end but I was able to just inch out a second place so that's much better than the last place I did the first time so all right so there you have it there's your Mario Kart wrap-up we'll try that again next week Loki's gonna bring his 3ds next week right Loki and then hopefully some of you guys can chat some more you'll be able to
I had to get the game.
I don't think you can do I don't think you can do online play with download.
Probably not with download, no.
But that's alright.
You'll have the game by next week.
I've been planning on picking it up but I was gonna do it this weekend but I just didn't get around to it.
Alright.
So there you go.
So I was like third place overall with the fourth place and second place.
So I wasn't last.
I think Tiger Claw was last.
Sorry buddy.
Might have been Zether.
I don't know.
I wasn't really paying attention.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on.
We're going to get back into the show here.
We got plenty more news to talk about.
And, of course, we have your calls, your emails.
Lots of emails tonight and plenty more to come.
So let's get back into some news.
Loki.
All right.
Well, let's talk a little bit about Grand Theft Auto because we haven't done enough of that since I stopped playing.
Grand Theft Auto 3 coming out on mobile devices next week for $5.
and the course that will be out on iOS and also Android marketplaces and is supported by most of the recent devices including the Apple iPad 1 and 2, iPhone 4 and 4S and the 4th generation iPod Touch which thankfully I have.
and also Android phones, the HTC ReSound LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Droid X2, Motorola Photon 4G, Samsung Galaxy R and T-Mobile G2X and of course some of the more recent tablets.
and it looks fun hopefully the controls work out pretty well and definitely worth picking up if you've you know I don't know if it supports any like bluetooth controllers they're pretty awesome but I'm kind of curious to see how the game looks
5 bucks so that'll be out on the 15th and there's a neat rumor going around for the circle pad that's coming out for the 3DS apparently it's gonna run on a AAA battery for 480 hours
That's some interesting... That's 20 days.
Yeah, that's a long time.
And shit, you know what?
Nintendo, you need to learn something about battery life because, man, those Wii remotes eat batteries like nothing.
And this thing...
I mean, I guess it just has an IR relay in it, so maybe it just doesn't take that much.
But even if that's true, even half that would be pretty good.
Nice to know that at least someone will replace batteries like crazy.
Because I'm not buying it.
And finally, Grasshopper and Digital Reality, they have a game coming out called Cynemora.
I'm not sure how they're pronouncing it.
and it's now going to be an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive.
It was supposed to be kind of a horizontal shmup game that was with 3D graphics and stuff and kind of a little bit different than Grasshopper.
I mean, it's not strange like a lot of the stuff that they normally put out.
So that's kind of cool that it's going to be coming out exclusively though on Xbox Live Arcade and not sure now if this is going to be a timed exclusive or if it's going to be exclusive permanently but
Diabolical Pitch House of the Dead Baseball
Where you're throwing baseballs at zombies and hitting stuff.
Okay, that's kind of more of the Grasshopper stuff where it's just really weird.
But pretty cool.
They need to adapt Battlefield Baseball because that was a fucking awesome movie.
All right.
Oops.
I'm not ready for that story yet.
Be quiet.
All right.
Moving on with some more news, some rapid-fire news.
Well, I guess I'll start with that since the music popped up in the background here.
What you're hearing there, that's the music.
I think this is music from the port.
It's a Commodore 64 port of the game Canabalt, which to me looks a lot like Bit.Trip Racer or the Magic Unicorn game, Comedy Central, that's on the iPhone.
Yeah, this was kind of the first of that series, I think.
Yeah, but the music kicks ass.
Listen to this.
That kicks a lot of ass.
Now, I don't think that's actually the Commodore 64 rendering that.
I think that's an MP3, but that's the type of stuff that 64 would make, and that's a pretty badass-sounding song.
But yeah, somebody has actually ported the game to the Commodore 64.
That is awesome.
So you can Google that to find it, because the link's a little bit complicated, but it's C64ANABALT, and it's being distributed pretty much as freeware, so you can play it in an emulator or what have you.
or just look at the YouTube.
It's YouTube user Heavy Stylist and you can just hear that sweet music that's playing there in the background.
Alright, some other news for you guys.
Somebody dared to sue Beyonce last year.
Remember this?
A $100 million lawsuit against Beyonce.
There was supposed to be a music game that was going to be created all around her but I guess for whatever reason she stopped it and 70 people lost their jobs over the whole thing.
well you know think about it they have that Black Eyed Peas game there's an ABBA dance game I mean it's not there's Michael Jackson so it's not unheard of that Beyonce might have her own dance game but it was stopped and they're now suing Beyonce for a hundred million dollars and I think a lot of people went ha ha ha that'll be a laugh well guess what the lawsuit was around allowed to move forward it was not thrown out of court so interesting to see what happens with this as it moves further
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There is a new cell phone, smartphone version of Dance Dance Revolution that's going to come out here next year.
It doesn't have a name yet, but they're saying it's going to be DDR, and it's supposed to have an emphasis on social gaming, which is ironic because this whole show started because DarkSakura, Loki, and I all met playing DDR.
It was a very social thing when it was in arcades.
I don't know how you're going to play DDR on your phone.
I think it'll be more like a response to Tap Tap Revenge, which is clearly inspired by this title, if you know what I'm saying.
DarkSakura!
Tech and Tag Tournament 2
Also, it's supposed to be coming to consoles.
It says holiday 2012.
There's a bunch of holidays.
So it's probably going to be Arbor Day.
Also, Mario Kart 7 sold 420,000 units its first week in Japan.
And Iwata said that it did even better across the world.
So that's pretty good, huh?
Very nice.
Good news for the 3DS.
Last bit, we have some good news for rock band fans.
Rush!
Yay!
It's the Rush Pack 01 that has Fly By Night, Caravan, and the Spirit of Radio, the live version.
And then individual songs, Rebel Love Song by Black Veil, Brides, and Warrior's Call by Volbeat.
And there is a pro bass and guitar expansion available for Fly By Night and the Spirit of Radio.
I like Rush.
Rush is a good band.
That was one of the songs that I was using to test out everything was Tom Sawyer.
Nice.
I was like, I can't sing that high.
It was pretty funny.
All right.
Well, we're going to get back into some long gaming news here with Loki, but I wanted to plug this first because I promised in chat earlier, Derek, one of the other hosts here at All Games Radio, who does his own show, Dead Pixel Live, wanted me to plug this.
And I said, sure, because I said last time when we didn't participate because none of us had the game, we would try to do the next one.
And I think the prospects for us participating here look much better.
It is the Big Battle Beatdown.
It is a fighting game tournament.
That's going to take place against a bunch of radio shows I don't think it's just restricted to all games I think Derek's going to try and get whoever he can to be a part of this But certainly we would like the OL Army to be a presence If you want more information, more information is available at thebigbattle.net I haven't had enough time since I just kind of found out about this tonight I haven't had enough time to go through and look at all the specifics But I can see that there are several games that will be involved here Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat as in the new one
Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
So a couple Street Fighters and a couple Mortal Kombats.
I kind of like the way that was done.
You have the new one and you have the classic one.
So whether you're a new gaming fan or a classic gaming fan, there's something for you here where you can represent the OL Army.
So that'll be fun.
I don't know what platform...
the games are on or if it's gonna they're gonna do it multi-platform style somehow or if it's like gotta all be on 360 but we'll try to get Derek on in the coming weeks and I think this is not starting until next year so soon
Thanks for watching!
Derek might be in chat too to clarify some of this later.
But I want to give a plug for that because I do want to participate.
So prepare to get your ass kicked, DarkSakura.
All right.
What?
I'm going to kick your ass in the big battle.
No, leave my ass alone.
Yes, I am.
All right.
Let's get back to some other gaming news.
Loki.
It's been announced that the last story is coming to Europe.
Another one of the Project Rainfall games ported over to English for European players.
It's coming out February 24th.
And, of course, no announcement about a North American release, but...
Hey, at least you get another game, Europeans.
Another Mistwalker game.
And that's fantastic.
Apparently it's pretty good.
That means there will be an English translation ready for America to Pirate.
Very soon.
Which is what I plan to do if they don't announce this anytime soon for the US.
If they're willing to put the US version out within three months or so, the US or Europe release, I'll wait.
I don't understand why they can't announce that.
I mean, they could say, hey, you know, we have, I mean, they're doing the English translation already.
Right.
Once again, I mean, it requires either no translation or maybe one person working on it for maybe a week at the most to translate English English to U.S.
English or American English.
And honestly, it's find replace.
I mean, it's so stupid that you know what a jumper is.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Seriously.
How many Final Fantasies have we had?
A bajillion?
This is the Final Fantasy as of right now.
We're up to 13-2 of them.
Oh no, wait, we have 14.
We have 13-2.
We have 0, and we have 10-2, and we have Mystic Quest and crap.
We have a lot of spin-offs.
It's just, whatever.
You counted Mystic Quest.
You played it.
Actually, I ain't even gonna lie, I loved Mystic Quest, but a majority of that was, the music was really good.
For not having been done by Nobuo Uematsu, the music in Mystic Quest is great.
Anyhow.
But, yeah, like, you know,
I'm not going to beg and plead for the last story.
And honestly, if it's not something that they just decide, hey, we're just going to put this out, you know, I'm hoping that there's an announcement within like a week or two because it's ridiculous otherwise.
I mean, all you're going to do, I mean, unless, are they just going to wait and see?
No, they can't wait and see how the sales are of, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles or whatever it is because it's not coming out until April.
So, you know, I don't know.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
that's honestly how I feel about it like if you don't want my money then fine I won't give it to you but I'm sick of this whole like what they're doing with Xenoblade is just I mean I still don't know what to do about that whole thing like I really want to buy it and support it because it's a great game but I'm really irritated and I think ultimately the end of the day I'll buy it well I'm irritated at two things one I'm irritated that it's this whole exclusive thing with the evil G which I hate however I do understand you can order it from Nintendo.com so if
If it's Nintendo shipping it to me and not Evil G, then I'll do it.
It's still stupid, though.
Why is it exclusive to a retailer?
I mean, I understand that they may have ponied up money to help import it over.
Fine.
Whatever.
That's fine.
That shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.
Yeah, actually, you're right.
A company shouldn't have had to say, hey, Nintendo, we're going to pay you money to localize it over here.
You don't have to fucking localize it.
You have to bring it over here, and you send a copy of the ESRB so it can get rated, which is just standard, and you just put it out over here because you're publishing it.
It's first-party publishing.
Case in point, and I don't think anybody can talk me out of this one.
DarkSakura is on the Orange Lounge Tumblr right now.
OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com Looking at a game called Magical Jewel Pet or something like that.
If this can be, if somebody's paying for this to come out on the DS, then somebody can pay for Xenoblade.
And you can't convince me that Xenoblade, there's something to it that makes it a bigger, more expensive to do because it's already been translated.
I don't understand.
Like there's so much shovelware that comes out on these systems.
There's no room for Xenoblade in this.
I don't understand what the... If you've got it translated into English... I mean, I understand if it's a Japanese game that they're just not going to translate into English.
Okay, yes, there's an issue there that bringing it over here may be unrealistic.
But if they're already translating it to English and releasing it in a different part of the world...
I don't understand.
There's no work you need to do.
It's done.
It's English already.
You don't need to translate anything.
You can't... I mean, last time I checked, when you put translate English to English and Google Translate, it comes out the same.
So I don't understand what they would need to do.
Can I ask this too?
What's wrong with a region-free system?
Why can't our system just be region free?
Has Sony Playstation 3 been hurting because it's region free?
Are we having rampant issues like just tons and tons of people getting all their games from Japan because of the region free thing?
what's the big fucking deal?
I would think if anything it helps them out the only time that they may have issues where they're maybe losing out a little bit and not everyone's going to go import stuff because it's expensive to import something you're paying almost twice the amount of money that you would pay to buy it locally and just for but a lot of times people are buying stuff that's not going to come out over here or RPGs that they want a special edition of or something like that that's not coming out in the United States or North America or whatever
And I mean, there's some European games that get released over there first.
You know, like there's maybe some Eidos games or Square Enix games that are going to be released over there.
Yeah, I'm fine with Europe getting the game a little early.
I mean, shit, they get screwed with stuff for us all the time.
And for them, this is a great thing.
So I get it.
But it's just kind of one of those whole things where it's like, you know, at some point they have to realize, thanks to the Internet, we live in a global world today.
I mean, so far, all the Sony systems from, like, the PSP, the PS3, and now the Vita is supposed to be region-free.
I mean, the DS was region-free, and then they decided, eh, let's poo-poo on that.
And now, you know, the 3DS, I'm just waiting for them to come out with something to, you know, like a card reader for the 3DS.
I'm sure there's one out there already.
I haven't looked, but...
Thanks for watching!
A few years ago.
That actually came out in Europe a lot earlier than it came out over here.
Not necessarily a game that you would want to get early, but if you wanted to play a God of War knockoff game, and it was pretty fun, earlier than you would get it here in the States, you could.
If you wanted to pay the money to have it imported.
I mean, I don't know.
I've done that before with some of the other Final Fantasy games, but not necessarily on PS3.
Alright, I feel like it's just another week and it's the same old rant.
When will Nintendo learn?
I don't know.
Because it seems like Nintendo is also the biggest offender when it comes to Europe getting things late too.
Nintendo needs to get their shit together with global releases.
Here's my problem though with this.
I don't want to buy this game because one, I understand if I buy the game that's supporting the fact that niche games like this do have a place in the United States.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and and I have a feeling though a lot of these other publishers are kind of doing this Capcom um and they're just making people jump through hoops to get a fucking game out of here for a franchise not necessarily a franchise right here but I mean this is a game that's gonna do well with the RPG crowd I mean you can't expect this to be Final Fantasy like I mean hell a Final Fantasy game or something like that is not gonna appeal to everyone fuck Skyrim is not gonna appeal to everybody I mean mom and
Your people that are playing Wii Sports and stuff like that don't give a fuck about Skyrim.
They're just like... They blow their mind.
They're just like, I don't know what to do with this.
Too many buttons.
Exactly.
It's like my wife trying to play it.
I can't adjust the camera and move the character at the same time.
So, I mean, it just blows their mind.
So you can't look at it doing as well as a...
And... I...
Yeah, there's a lot of crap out there.
Alright, let's move on.
We gotta move on with more stories or we're gonna be here all night.
So I wanna talk about a story about the PlayStation Vita.
It's not about region free and all that stuff, but is the Vita region free?
I can't remember.
It's supposed to be.
They're saying that it is, but I don't think anyone's really gotten one.
Obviously, it's only out in one region and no one's really confirmed either way.
I think it is.
Alright, we'll find out soon.
Jamie and Dan share all their gaming systems, I'm sure.
Or Loki and Nelly share their gaming systems.
I don't share.
What system did you try to teach Nelly?
Was it Nelly's copy of Skyrim you tried to teach her to play?
No, I don't share portable systems.
Oh, see, well, Alan uses Netflix on the 3DS all the time.
Like, he uses Netflix more than I do because he really gets a lot of use out of the 3DS thing.
But then he'll also play my copy of Mario Kart on my save file, which is okay.
It's fine.
He's unlocking some stuff.
It works great for a game like Super Mario 3D Land where you have three save files.
I'm number one, he's number two, and if I ever let a friend come over and play the game, they can have save file number three.
It works out great.
Oh, that's right.
You told me to write over save file one.
Shut up.
It's true.
But anyway, my point is that some people do, especially couples and stuff will tend to share these systems a lot.
So when they heard that only one user per system, it was a little bit of an alarm.
However, there was a follow-up article that came out very quickly afterwards, and that is the official line from Sony America, quote, your PlayStation Network ID is bonded to your memory card, and your memory card is bonded to your Vita.
So, in other words, you can have multiple PlayStation Network accounts, each tied to a memory card.
But if you try to move the account from one card to another, it's going to get more interesting.
And we just had the story last week about all those memory cards, now freaking expensive they are.
So, it's like good news and bad news.
Good news, yes, you can't have more than one account.
Bad news, you're going to have to buy more memory cards to do it.
And then you can't just move them from one Vita to another, it sounds like.
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't like the fact that they're tied to your Vita.
I don't see how that's necessary, because what's the point in having a memory card then?
I mean, I guess someone was saying, well, I can't take my memory card from one Vita and play it on my friend's Vita, but it's like, why would you do that?
Just take your Vita with you.
But I don't know if it's really a problem that a lot of people have.
It sucks that they're doing this, tying it to the system and stuff, because...
and it's just bad for Sony because this is a problem that will be solved by hacking unfortunately and only creating these problems creates people that want to find the solution for it and the solution's not good for Sony unfortunately
Alan's in chat right now and his feathers are a little ruffled at what I said about Mario Kart.
He says, Salacious Pops in chat saying, well, I always win and unlock shit, so, you know.
Maybe he's better than you at drifting.
Yeah, perhaps.
Perhaps.
Shut up.
I almost considered asking you if I could play your second match.
Oh, I would have let you.
Oh, man.
Maybe next week.
If you don't have your own copy by then I'll let you race during the midpoint break.
Alright, anyway.
Also, I want to point out what Rob D. is saying in our chatroom at chat.orangeandre.com Yeah, Japan has a totally separate set of standards when it comes to this sort of thing.
They don't care whether lots of people buy their stuff.
They care about making money.
They will not price niche media and aim for the most sales.
They will price niche media for the passionate people and gouge them.
I mean, okay, listen.
Ironic, this is coming right after the Xenoblade last story stuff about gouging niche people.
Listen, I understand that the memory cards... Okay, the memory cards are what they are.
You're either gonna just buy one, just get over the fact that they're fucking expensive, and just buy one.
Because guess what?
The...
PSP Memory Stick Pro Duos were fucking expensive when they came out and that shit came down in price once other peripherals and stuff were using them.
Yes, it's a proprietary card.
Just get over it.
Buy your fucking 4 gig card or whatever the hell.
Trust me, you're not going to need more than 4 gigs for the system unless you're downloading a ton of games online.
In which case, you can think about maybe getting a bigger one later on.
For me, if I was going to get a Vita...
Whatever, I'm going to be the only one using the thing So it's not a big deal for me And yeah, it sucks for the people that want to share It's not the end of the world, in my opinion As far as, let's say at Alan and I's house Where we're both big gamers and nerds and stuff I can kind of say, obviously I'm getting a Vita I mean, no question, because I have to have all the nerd stuff And it's going to be, I think, a good system Got a lot of good games coming on it
as far as the save file goes I at least like the fact that you know we could get Alan a cheap little memory card for his saves and then he can have his own PlayStation Network ID or at the end of the day if it's really just save files I mean if a game will still give you three save slots or something on one memory card then you know or a lot of Sony games kind of let you save an unlimited number of files like I have like seven saves on White Knight Chronicles 2 just because it just keeps adding to the list Skyrim I think I have six or seven saves too these are all on PS3 so
He can just have his own saves, and I don't think he's going to really care about trophies on his own account.
Well, maybe he will.
Here's what I'm worried about, and here's the reason why they're doing this.
It's like on the PlayStation 3, if you download, say, download content or whatever, everybody I think on the console can use that download content.
Oh, no, I know where you're going with this.
And so now they're going to get you, oh, hey, you like that download content?
Well, fuck you.
You're going to have to buy it for yourself instead of sharing it.
That is kind of shitty, actually.
So that's kind of what they're doing, I think, with this.
But, like, once again, you know, listen, it is what it is.
You either just get over yourself.
You either support it or you don't.
Yeah, you either get over yourself and buy the system or not.
I mean, is that really going to hold you back that you've got to buy an expensive memory card?
I don't have to like it, and I can complain on the internet.
I mean, just deal with it, and that's it.
I mean, it sucks, and I'm sure there'll be a third-party workaround eventually, but, I mean, unless you really want to wait for that,
And you know what?
Hey, there's nothing wrong with waiting.
Yeah, everybody's going to be buying.
Well, not everybody, but a lot of people are going to be buying it at launch.
But guess what?
Prices come down.
There's bundles that come out later on.
You get a bunch of free shit.
So just wait if you're unsure about it.
Wait until the following holiday season and stuff, and you might score it even cheaper than it is now.
We're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute here, but I want to read one more comment from chat from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.
He's trolling.
Listen to this.
Bobby Blackwolf says in chat, You mean I could have beaten both Sky and Loki at Mario Kart?
I think he's throwing down the gauntlet there a little bit.
Could've, if you were good enough to beat me.
It's on.
It's already been brought in.
I like this.
I think we need to do more of this where we play games either right before, well, I don't want to say before because we don't want to step on Bobby's toes, maybe right after OLR during the midpoint break.
I like the idea that people can kind of play games, or even during the show.
Shit, I don't care if you're playing Mario Kart right now and listening to OLR.
We'll have to play after his show because we don't want him crying during his show.
Uh oh, uh oh, alright Moving on, on that note, let's get to the mailbag
Thousands and thousands of emails received.
You have to remember, this is the first mailbag since all the website outage stopped.
So our emails have been piling up.
So unfortunately, DarkSakura can only pick a few.
So DarkSakura has sifted through the mailbox, like it was kitty litter, has sifted through the mailbox and pulled out a few nuggets for you.
You know what?
There's this one Caturday picture that I kept seeing on the web of a cat standing up looking super surprised, saying, Someone keeps coming in and stealing my poop!
And you just made me think of that.
Great.
So let's see who's poop we've stolen.
The first one, hi OLR, it's me again, your friendly, catastrophic Magi.
I know it's been a while since I last emailed.
After listening to your last show and Robb Stark contrasting with Skyrim and Final Fantasy XIII, the two show clearly the difference between Western and Japanese RPGs.
Western RPGs mainly focus on character creation, you're lucky if you get to even pick a name in a JRPG, and world exploration, while JRPGs focus on story and character drama leading to a much more linear affair.
Also, Rob, have you played either of the first two Elder Scrolls games?
They're both now available as freeware.
If you think Skyrim is big, you should check out Daggerfall, which boasts a game world twice the size of Great Britain that would take over two full weeks to cross in real time.
Yeah, but it's all just an algorithm-generated thing.
Of course, it is all randomly generated, so it's all quite samey.
Before I go, I just wanted to pass on some preview footage of a game to you because I know how much you love the series.
I bet it will be 20% cooler than any other game.
Hear you later, Magi.
And it is...
Silent Ponyville, the game.
Nice.
Can you send me the link for that?
I guess.
Just copy, paste, and chat.
Silent Ponyville?
I want to see this.
Silent Ponyville.
Is it like Silent Hill?
Hold on.
But with my little pony or something?
All right.
And just real quick on the whole earlier Elder Scrolls games.
I haven't really played them a lot in depth, but I'm kind of familiar with them.
And I especially know the older PC RPGs, how they used to be.
They'd be vast, but the dungeons...
were quite as visual as they are now.
People like Skyrim because not only is it big, but it looks real.
The graphics are getting so good.
I'm going to fast forward here a little bit.
Silent Ponyville.
That's exactly what it is.
It's Silent Hill meets My Little Pony.
Is there a pyramid head in this that comes out and chops her head off?
This is like somebody's art project that they spent a lot of time making.
I'm not sure how to feel about this.
Next email.
Hi, OLR.
After hearing Loki rave about Ready Player One, I was all ears being myself a rather old gamer started with the C64.
So I bought myself a copy and have just started, but it really is a page turner.
If you have the chance, do get the author on your show.
I'm certain that that will result in a very interesting podcast.
Best regards from the UK, Mark.
We'll try.
I forgot to look into that, but we will.
Our listeners can read.
Yes, of course they can read.
How dare you insult the listeners.
He's from the UK, so I'm assuming he can read.
Therefore, he's more well-educated.
He's more smarter.
More smarter.
Better, gooder reader.
Um, okay.
Hey guys, this is Blade 3, aka Sam1.
Well, what are you, Blade 3 or Sam1?
Oh, no, Sam.
He's not using any punctuation, so whatever.
I just wanted to say to Loki that Laszlo on Integrity 2.0 Radio and GTA 4 sounds exactly like Rob.
It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.
Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.
Keep up the good work.
The show is fantastic.
I've been listening since I was five.
Thanks to you guys, by the way.
I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000, so cut some slack-o.
Exclamation point!
Seriously, that's the only... Okay, I'm going to reread this email the way it's written.
Alright.
Hey guys, this is Blade3, aka Sam.
I just wanted to say that Loki, Laszlo on Integrity 2.0 Radio and GTA 4 sounds exactly like Robert Melmus makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob either way.
I thought you would get a kick out of that.
Keep up the good work.
This show is fantastic.
I've been listening since 05.
Thanks guys.
By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000, so cut some slack.
so cut some slack-o why aren't you cutting some slack-o I don't know what the fuck slack-o is I have heard the Lazlo comparison before actually, you're not the first to mention it funny enough, I haven't played enough Grand Theft Auto where I know that I know, it's like the one game series I don't play enough of so I'll just have to take your word for it I would love to loan my voice to a game sometime though maybe when they do Legend of the Magical Pony 2 alright
I want to be in a game, Rob.
I want to do voice acting.
I think it would be fun.
I think that we would be awesome voice actors.
I think so too.
What we should do, we should get a video game script and reenact it live on OLR.
We could do that.
If we wanted to get someone with a fun voice just on the show randomly, we should get Agro on here.
We should do dramatic reading of 8-bit video game scripts.
That would be great.
Yes.
But we should get Agro on here sometime to do his announcer voice.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
That guy from WoW.
Oh, God.
So cool.
Hello.
I know.
All right.
Hi, everyone.
I just finished listening to November's Internet Outrage-Ridden Podcast, and it's one time I thought I don't listen live.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not going to read it.
No, sorry.
Okay.
Anyhow, being an avid Android gamer, I wanted to chime in with my suggestions for your Twitter topic poster.
All reviewed in 140 characters or less-ish so DarkSakura can read them without having kittens because that just makes Shermie feel inadequate.
Well, that's okay because Shermie can't have kittens anyway.
She's too old.
Her uterus fell out.
What's uterus talking about, Willis?
How many times can we say uterus in one radio show?
Angry Birds.
If someone stole my eggs, I'd go after them too, so have a fling and smash those pigs.
Asphalt 5.
3D racing with accelerator support for older models and a GT clone.
Hope you have steady wrists.
Asphalt HD.
Graphics update for higher-end devices and tablets.
Now with more cars, new tracks, repetitive stress, wrist injuries.
Battleheart.
Addicting dragon attack action with challenging battles and a variety of party and equipment options.
Not much of a story, though.
Shh.
Banzai Blast Japanese Zen-flavored Zuma clone with high replayability value for those 5-minute potty breaks where peace and calm are oh so important Dr. Stanley's House 1 and 2 point-and-click mystery game you misspelled mystery by the way
with a twist ending ported from a Flash game.
Duck Hunter, think SNES classic minus the dog with really funny foul play.
Ah, I see your pun.
Fruit Ninja, blah.
I mean, care for a fruit salad and have a minute to lose.
Flick at your screen and get as many fruits before the time runs out.
You'll have a blast.
You're still trying to make my cat talk?
I'm rubbing her belly.
She likes it.
Hexadictus.
Hexagonal match-three puzzle game.
No, really, that's about it.
Kid Mode.
Great for parents with kids 2 through 10 with edutainment options.
Galore activity.
Reporting family... Muffin Night?
What the crap game is that?
Pumpkins vs. Monsters.
It's a clone of... You know what?
I'm not reading the rest of this.
Well, hopefully at least one of them sparked your listeners or your interest.
Listen to you next week, Dr. Noir.
Well, I wanted to hear more about pumpkin whatevers, but DarkSakura was like, no.
Smiley pops.
PS's email was written at 5am while waiting for a delayed flight back to Mexico at a Colombian airport with no coffee available.
I know, ironic, right?
After four straight 15-hour work days, so if I misspelled something, blame it on the exhaustion.
Okay, I forgive you this time.
And I might go post your list later.
I'll put it on the Tumblr eventually.
Xbox has followed in the footsteps of PSN Network.
That's redundant, isn't it?
PSN Network, that's like ATM card or PIN number Are you thinking ATM machine?
Yeah, ATM machine and PIN number I've linked an article, though I actually didn't hear about it from them My husband is in law school and he actually reads the terms of service before he agrees Anyway, the overall impression he gave me was this is a crappy backhanded move but as far as crappy backhanded moves go, it's not so bad
Essentially, while they block you from class action, they agree to pay all fees associated with arbitration and formally agree to pay $1,000 or what the arbitrator decides is fair, whichever is greater.
It's still crappy, though, and that's from Holly D. It's still crappy.
It's still crappy, but I agree, less crappy.
This is from Robobobobobobobo.
I sent the following email to my state's consumer protection division of the Attorney General's office.
I'll let you know what they reply.
I did discover that my mandatory arbitration can be disputed if you feel treated unfairly.
Oddly enough, it would take something extraordinary for me to want to sue a game system manufacturer.
And this is the email.
I give this guy massive props for actually doing something about it, though.
Lately, video game console manufacturers are updating their EULAs for operating their game systems with mandatory arbitration clauses.
Are there sources of information on what clauses are allowed in EULAs and what clauses are invalidated by Maryland law?
As for my own opinion, it seems wrong that an expensive electronics device can be rendered useless if you don't agree completely with the EULA.
Thanks for any response.
That's not how he signed it, but that's how I'm saying it.
I still want to see what reply.
Okay.
And that's it.
All right.
I mean, that's not it, of course, for emails.
We got a bajillion emails in the last few weeks.
It's been building up for like a month, keep in mind.
But I ain't reading anymore.
But if you would like to be considered for next week, we read them all at least, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
And by the way, you have a better chance if your email is concise.
The PETA Tanuki suit thing is still topical.
I'll show you my thesis on this.
PETA is intentionally grabbing negative attention for donations.
It has nothing to do with what they are trying to protect.
How better to get attention by being negative publicity about a beloved icon?
PETA's logic is this.
An imaginary character wears an imaginary suit with special powers.
This tanuki suit resembles a tanuki fur, which a tanuki is a mythical creature, by the way.
It's just a raccoon dog.
so the imaginary prospect of killing an animal is bad slash evil so send money PETA is pretty famous for flinging fake blood on real furs to demonstrate the cruelty of the fur industry and equating fur with murder so their fake blood is that of a fake animal or worse of a fake human by their own logic they are advocating animal slash people slaughter I think Jamie said it best when she said a few weeks ago PETA is crazy of course that's why people love picking on Mickey Mouse too okay that's it alright mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because it's our show and sometimes we have angst and we have to get it all out in a segment called the FUs of the Week.
A big F you goes to the increased militarization of national police forces and to there not being enough change in the way people vote to where we still have assholes in office and also to assholes running for office who like to wear the same jacket from Brobeck Mountain.
Loki.
Fuck you to my radio in my car because apparently the track skip forward button is starting to break and so sometimes it thinks, or actually most of the time now, it thinks I'm hitting track backwards and then sometimes it thinks I'm also changing the mode of my player to play the radio or something like that.
or sometimes it will actually work and go forward.
So that fucking sucks because now it's making it very difficult to pick the song I want to listen to.
Alright, my FU, first one goes to Rick Perry, because he's such an assbag.
And I have a right to say that.
I believe that Rick Perry is an assbag.
You know what?
I imagine when you said assbag, that he was actually the bag that attaches to a colostomy.
That's pretty much what he is.
Just disgusting and gross and insulting the way he's pandering to people.
It's just insulting.
So, just, I don't... Barf, barfy barfs.
Did you see the thing that Santorin said?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and that's a good compliment but some of them need to learn such humility so anyway without getting too political but my other FU I will say that's a little sillier is FU to the fact that in looking for raid in World of Warcraft that only one piece of gear has dropped for me
Can I add to that too?
What?
F you to that pug last night.
You need to do what I do and start writing down their names and servers and reading it on Horde House.
John wrote them all down.
Oh, did he?
Yeah, we were going to email you.
Oh, you should.
You should do that.
They were all from the same server.
Alright.
Dick faces.
Alright, there you go.
That's it for the FUs of the week.
Just a few more news stories for you guys.
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Add us on Skype if you haven't already.
But we'll get to that in a minute.
First, more stories.
Loki.
Yes, this is kind of neat.
OnLive is finally coming to the iOS platform as well as Android.
And it's really neat.
You can actually use it to play games on your tablet or phone device.
They also are going to be selling a wireless controller that comes with the free app download as well for about, I want to say, $50, which also is the same price as a streaming console if you really want to.
And it is Bluetooth and allows you to basically use your tablet as a screen instead of having to use the on-screen touch-sensitive buttons and stuff that they have, which they have that option if you don't want to do that.
And apparently also some of the games that they're actually converting over to work with the touch controls on these tablets.
Like, for example, L.A.
Noire was something that Rockstar Games is actually going back and fixing that up so that you can use touch controls with the game as well.
And I want to say there was Kingdom of Keflings that was also going to be getting kind of the same treatment as well.
It just looks kind of neat, and I guess it works pretty well.
I actually thought about downloading this to try it.
I don't know if I have to actually purchase the app to check it out, but obviously you need an online subscription and stuff.
But it'd be neat to check out.
I would not want to play on my iPod, though, with the screen controls, because I can imagine my hand would cover the whole damn thing.
But it's still kind of neat that they could do this.
You know what would be really cool, I guess?
I don't know if it has the power to do that, but the Apple TV, if you could do an app like that.
But with the rumors around the corner that Apple is actually creating their own TV set soon, this very well could be integrated into something like that.
That's one way to get more Apple TVs sold.
I'm talking about the actual set-top boxes.
Just build it into an actual TV.
Yeah.
Make them in cool colors and everybody will want one.
It's an interesting prospect.
It works pretty good.
Of course, the only downside is obviously it's not going to work as good as your streaming console because those are normally wired connections versus this.
You probably want to be on Wi-Fi to be able to...
Play the games, you know, full resolution without any lag.
Although, from what I was reading, like, you know, games are normally 60 frames per second.
It was 50 frames per second.
And, you know, maybe the resolution's a little lower than it would normally be.
But overall, not too bad.
I actually saw some gameplay footage of someone playing Saints Row the Third on an iPod or something like that.
Wow.
So that was kind of cool looking.
Yeah.
Saints Row 3rd on the go.
That is tempting.
But, yeah, I don't know.
It's a really neat idea.
So it will be interesting to see.
What games are supported right now?
They don't have all of the games obviously supporting this, but they're launching with about 18 games.
I guess they launched originally with 21 games when the streaming console came out.
They're going to be adding more as they convert some over and get them to work a little bit better with the portable systems.
Alright, very interesting the way this technology is going.
I think this could be pretty huge in the future because even if it's not on live itself, people are going to see what on live is doing and think hmm, how can we do that for our gaming experience?
It's just a matter of time before developers just cut out on live completely.
I mean especially on something like iOS why the only thing you need on live for is their bandwidth and maybe I don't think the technology is particularly proprietary because there are competitors like there was that whole FIFA streaming to YouTube thing that was Genkai or whatever so it's going to be interesting to see what happens
Anyhow, I want to move on to another story.
This had the game world talking this week.
This was huge news this week because Wired had an interview with Miyamoto and they ran the headline.
This is the headline, quote, Nintendo's Miyamoto stepping down working on smaller games.
And everybody took that and said,
Literally, this is around the rest of the internet.
Miyamoto's quitting Nintendo.
Miyamoto is retiring because people read into that saying Miyamoto's stepping down and they kind of miss the hidden subtext.
And granted, this headline is a little bit sensationalistic, but that's the way headlines are kind of written to be.
is that Miyamoto's stepping down from the Mario and Zelda games that he's been working on.
And of course, Nintendo followed this up with an official quote where Nintendo is basically like, no, no, no, Miyamoto is not retiring.
video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto's role at Nintendo is not changing he will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts in discussing his priorities at Nintendo in a media interview Mr. Miyamoto explained how he is encouraging the younger developers of the company to take more initiative and responsibility for developing software and in fact if you kind of go back to the original interview here's what the Wired article says
Quote,
When all is said and done, the internet was making this out to sound like bad news, I think this is great news.
I think this is fantastic news.
I don't think Miyamoto should be taking all this time to work on Zelda and Mario games when the outlines are pretty much all laid out.
I mean, I think he should be there to give creative input and so forth, but that's really it.
I mean, these things are in kind of capable hands now.
You know, Miyamoto ain't getting any younger.
he's been making games since the original NES which just celebrated his 25th anniversary so I would like to see before he really does have to retire I mean all good things must come to an end folks someday Miyamoto's gonna die so I hope it's not for a long time I'm not saying anything rude yeah I'm just saying and inevitably someday Orange Lounge Radio will end
It has to end at some point.
I'm not saying it's going to end this week.
And we're going to try to go as long as we possibly can.
Someday, Grandma will grab Pogo to die.
But my point is, you know, maybe Miyamoto's like, do I really want to spend the rest of my years in Nintendo working on another Zelda game?
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But what if in that brain of his is the next Mario or the next Zelda?
I mean, aren't you all complaining at the same token?
I'm kind of sick of Nintendo putting out the same shit over and over again.
Then let Miyamoto develop something else.
This is fantastic news.
You get limited when you're stuck with the same thing over and over again.
It's the same reason why actors don't want to be typecast.
Don't you think?
Yes.
Same thing.
And of course, now the chat room is running with this, Actdeft.
Miyamoto will never die.
Don't say such cruel things, Rob.
Alpha Cananogram.
Miyamoto die, kill the non-believer.
Well, I will say this.
I will say this.
This is a high compliment.
When the inevitable happens and Miyamoto passes away, think of it this way.
The work that he's created in some ways kind of defines this generation.
It defines a part of our culture.
And some of us could only be so lucky to have really made that kind of impact on the world.
I mean, Miyamoto made an impact on the world.
So in that sense, Miyamoto is immortal in that sense.
Right, DarkSakura?
Yeah, I've been listening to you at all, have you?
Yeah, no, I was, but I actually just had a brush with celebrity moment.
Oh?
One of my favorite people ever who's been on a reality show, and I'm not a big reality show person, but I love MasterChef.
Ben Starr, the guy who has like fourth place on the season before last, just said that he thought that my dish sounded delicious.
Wow.
I asked him for advice on cooking a butternut squash.
Wow.
Just because I was like, I'll ask a pro, why not?
And he seems to reply to people, but he gave me his method, but he gave it to me like 20 hours late.
So he's like, so what did you end up doing with it?
And I said, oh, I cooked it and it was still firm, so I saved it to microwave.
And I said, I mixed this, that, and the other, and he said, that sounds really yummy.
So I was like, I got a compliment.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let me put it this way.
When I followed George Takei on Twitter, he sent me a direct message.
It's like, thanks for following me and all that stuff.
I know he didn't write it.
I know he's got people that probably do that stuff.
He's not sitting there at his computer all day.
He's got better things to do.
And probably a lot of that stuff he posts to Facebook too.
Some of it might get his approval, but he probably has a whole team of people that maintain his public image.
And I'll tell you this, they do a damn fucking good job
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I said that I love my family, but I wish that I had been adopted by George Takei and Julie Andrews.
Or if they were really my parents, then I would be half Japanese with an amazing singing voice.
And probably a raging lesbian.
All right.
Let's move on.
Just a few more news stories for you guys.
Dark Sakura.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, oh no.
Well, that at least makes the delay between versions a little more worth the wait if they've managed to tweak it to look even better.
I mean, granted, you probably need the highest of high-end systems to be able to really see, but it's still pretty cool.
But see, they're showing it versus the PS3 and the PC, some of the difference in the shading effect and the textures.
Yeah.
It actually, and I have to say, because we have the PS3 one here, as clean as it was, I mean, it's really hard to compare a console with a PC.
When the PCs are consistently upgradable, you know, you can get the best stuff for it.
Yeah.
But as beautiful as the textures and the lighting and everything in the PC one was, it actually really makes me appreciate the PS3 version.
Because it really is pretty close.
Even though, I mean, yeah, tech spec wise, the PC one will blow it out of the water.
But the PS3 version really keeps up.
It's a gorgeous game.
Absolutely gorgeous game.
One of the year's best.
But there are also some other improvements too, just in the PC one.
Other than the higher resolution textures, they actually, it's all the stuff that you see up close, like pores and indentations under the skin.
You can see veins.
They really put a lot of effort into making it look realistic.
I want to go back to chat.
The chat room's a little bit delayed, but there was a great quote here from chat on the Miyamoto thing.
I want to read this real quick here from Midori in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com I love your drinks.
He, meaning Miyamoto, will be immortal, but I understand that if I had the choice, I'd want to be known for making the most favored characters over how many games I could develop for a few loved characters.
That's a really good way to sum it up, so I just wanted to throw that out there, because that mirrors my thoughts very closely.
All right, just a couple quick stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is going to open up.
So, Loki.
All right.
So this is neat, I guess.
They're going to be giving a little bit of bonuses for fans of Final Fantasy XIII too, or even the original Final Fantasy game.
If you play the original Final Fantasy XIII game and you have a game save, you're going to be getting some special features, including special monster decorations and
and a higher success rate at the games.
I guess they have a gambling area.
I wonder if it's anything like, what was that in Final Fantasy VII, like the Golden something or other, I can't remember what it was called.
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
Also, I guess they're saying that the game's going to be broken up into episodes and each episode will be about three hours long.
Also going to be adding an auto-save system as well as the ability to save it at different places.
plus there's going to be a new game plus mode that adds I guess unlockable items and also new monster decorations as well and neat I mean that extra stuff is good I know that they're going to be doing some DLC though for it and I think that's kind of ridiculous as far as what they're adding with the DLC I think more monster decorations but remember it's optional you don't need to buy it
Well, that's good as long as it's extra frilly stuff and not necessary to the game's completion.
Yeah.
But the game's sounding better and better.
I can't wait to play it.
I really need to actually finish the last chapter of Final Fantasy XIII.
You know, I was digging through my bag the other day and I saw Final Fantasy XIII there.
I'm like...
Oh yeah, I need to finish that.
By the way, chat room to the rescue on the gambling thing in Final Fantasy 7.
Gold saucer.
Yeah, it is gold something.
Alright, and one more Final Fantasy related story for you guys this week and it has to do with Final Fantasy 14.
Guess what?
They are going to charge service fees for Final Fantasy 14.
Wah, wah, wah.
I'm not playing.
Final Fantasy XIV, here's the deal.
They will be implementing the fee change on January 6th.
This has been pushed back a little bit.
It was supposed to start by now, essentially.
So on January 6th, they are going to start the new pricing structure.
So what will happen is that the subscription fees, this is weird, the basic service is $6.99 for 30 days.
and then the real subscription fee when the new version starts will be $9.99 for 30 days it's kind of weird the way that's set up but there you go and if you want extra characters that's the other weird thing it's $3 a character it's definitely cheaper than $14.95 but still I mean that monthly fee it's going to be very interesting to see the impact that has on the game I think it's going to kill it I think it has us die hard fans that still support it but now that they're going to ask money out of pocket every month that's going to be rough I know I won't pay for it
I'll go back and check it out when version 2 launches.
Or if there's some huge content upgrade.
I think Zether summed it up in chat.
Well, there goes Final Fantasy 14.
Bye-bye.
Nice knowing you.
Let's go to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm going to check the Twitter too to see if we have any tweets.
I forgot to ask for those earlier because I was so involved in the Mario Kart thing earlier but I'll look for those if I can find them amongst the new Twitter because they've changed the look of Twitter again.
Why?
Because they can.
Although I will say it's not terrible.
Alright, let's go to the Skype line.
Meanwhile, while we wait for the Skype line, Loki, do we have last minute stories?
I'm sure there's got to be a few tonight because I think there were some big things I skipped over, right?
Maybe.
I didn't look them up.
I'm trying to think here if there's anything really major that I could think of off the top of my head.
I have a couple tweets while you're looking.
Mishiru-chan says, I just picked up the Oregon Trail game for the Wii and it's pretty fun.
I'm working on doing a write-up to post on site.
Awesome.
I would like to hear more about it.
I hope it's better than the Facebook one, that's for sure.
I think it looks very similar to the Facebook and the phone version that they had out.
In fact, I would be surprised if it wasn't the exact same.
I hope it will not die of dysentery.
YYR tweets us saying, remember, boom, and sends us a YouTube link.
Usually I don't play YouTube links on the show, but I'm hoping that it's a link from BungieFerretCat.
Oh no, this is from Magic Knight Rayearth.
and Precious.
Mysterious Sephiroth lecture number three.
You've just mastered the skill known as the Pulverizing Bash.
Indeed, by running to increase your speed, the power to throw yourselves increases as well.
You can destroy places with weak foundations or small cracks with incredible ease.
Be sure to give yourself plenty of room to run so you can increase your speed.
That's right!
Make a good approach, start running, and then... Boom!
That's all for today!
um oh yesterday I recently beat um well yesterday I beat um Snatcher yesterday it was really fun oh I freaking love Snatcher gosh that's old school nice yeah it's I I would I didn't think I would be able to finish it like to finish all of it but I finished like the second by the time you finish the second act the game pretty much becomes like pretty much just go like goes automatically for you but there is this one final shooting segment that's actually very difficult um
it was the super insector things and they start like swarming around the screen and then I kept dying repeatedly at that part and then it came up to the I didn't realize that there was a second part where you had to shoot snatchers and I died during that and it kicks you back to the first part again with the insectors so it's a little annoying having to keep doing it over and over but I beat it, it was pretty good
It's always a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a game.
It's one I haven't felt in a long time because I have such gamer ADD I never finish anything.
Yeah, I actually did finish Saints Row the Third a month ago, I think.
Now what did you think of Saints Row the Third?
Because I just played it for the first time this week.
I think it was really good.
It was pretty over-the-top insane.
I pre-ordered it on Steam full price, and I definitely got what I paid for.
It was really good.
Nice.
I love how over-the-top it is.
Did you try to make a character who was kind of like you, or did you make a character who was over-the-top too?
I actually downloaded a character from the...
from like the online thing they had a guy who looked like Gabe Newell so I used him for the whole game nice and it was hilarious just seeing this guy running who looks like Gabe Newell running around like being all snarky and blowing stuff up it's like oh wow Gabe Newell is blowing up a helicopter now he's killing these furries in this game show that sounds like something Gabe Newell might actually do
Yeah, it was pretty good.
Awesome.
Well, it sounds like I've barely scratched the surface of the game.
Furries on a game show?
I haven't come across this yet, so it sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it's one of the side missions.
You play in Genki's little ridiculous game show thing.
I keep doing the missions, like, one after another.
Should I just say, screw it, and kind of drive around and look for stuff?
No, because they're going to take you through all the, like...
Diversions basically by actually playing the missions because it goes through the whole tutorial mode a little long but it's good because you've never played any of the games so you don't know how to play insurance fraud or anything like that.
But they'll take you through the Genki show and
Tiger Escort and stuff like that oh yeah that one's good the tank one is the best I think the tank one where you have to rack up the most money and damage is the best because you can literally just keep pressing forward holding down both fire buttons for the minigun and the main cannon you can pretty much just keep racking up the points it's all about the fences
My favorite thing so far has been the little computer that my chick picked up and she can use it to just fire guided missiles at tanks.
Oh yeah, that's awesome.
It's kind of like a missile launch.
Yeah, the missile drop thing.
Yeah, it's like a little computer you use to launch missiles.
I guess it's like a regular weapon you can use to just launch guided missiles at your foes.
That's pretty impressive.
and I gotta say the environments like I love the whole like downtown LA looking environment it's very neon and I love purple so I'm glad it's the gang's color
Just wait until you get to the Tron world.
The Tron world is amazing.
I'm sure I'll have a huge boner over the Tron world.
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
I was enjoying every minute of it.
Awesome.
Awesome.
All right, well, Zether, any other final thoughts to get out there before we let you go?
Not much.
I finished Snatcher and I'm actually playing the MSX version because somebody translated it.
Old school Snatcher.
Yeah, even older than the Sega CD-1.
And then I'm probably going to go play Policenauts, which is the follow-up of sorts.
You're just having a Kojima Fest over there.
I have Policenauts on PlayStation.
Check out the original Metal Gear.
Yeah, that's the one that got translated, actually.
And the real Metal Gear 2 that's on MSX.
Well, no, I mean, I've got it in Japanese, and it was a pain in the butt trying to play through in Japanese.
Oh yeah, it is.
Lots of text.
Alright, well, Zether, enjoy your Kajima-thon, okay?
Alright.
Alright, later.
Later.
1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
AkumaJP in chat says, human rights for furries, too.
Well, you know what?
If I'm not mistaken, you could make your character a furry, and you could just revenge the furries.
So if you want to blow everything up as a furry, you have every right to do so.
And you could lead this notorious gang of criminals, if you want, that everybody stops and asks for the autograph.
So like, I just remember in the very beginning of the game, some girl asked for some guy's autograph and then I walked up and she didn't want my autograph so I shot her.
I was like, how rude, bang.
Game makes me sound like a terrible person, but it's really fun.
That's because you are a terrible person.
Hey!
I'll shoot you too.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Alright.
More last minute stories-ish things going on over there?
Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD
Legend of Zaku here.
Zaku, what's up?
Nothing much, just kicking back, making sure I stay calm and sane before tomorrow's work week.
Well, good luck.
It's been a while since I called.
It's been a little while.
What have you been playing?
What's new?
Let's see, Forza 4, having to tackle the wireless steering wheel that Microsoft released for the 360.
But all in all, it's been like...
I've been mostly that and just playing my PC, but nothing new on that end.
Do you use head tracking in Forza 4 at all?
Do you have Kinect?
I don't have a Kinect.
I don't have enough space in my room for a Kinect.
You could get one of those little Zoom things, but I kind of bought one and it kind of sucks for me.
I didn't like it.
It's smaller than the dorm rooms I was in, you know, in college.
Well, you do live in New York City.
Yeah, but it's a house.
Anyways, like I noticed yesterday, I know it's almost like gaming related, but one of the best DDR freestylers in the country, you know, frequency.
I know him in real life.
He had his little going away party yesterday and pretty much all the old school DDR players came out.
Where's he going to?
Moving back to Long Island.
Oh, okay.
So yeah, that was pretty much me just getting drunk.
I think I should have gotten a DDR dollar bill into the mix, but I didn't even notify him.
But anyways, shifting on real quick, video game awards were yesterday, and I noticed that Battlefield 3 got shafted.
Thank you for watching!
it's it's well without getting into the whole modern warfare versus battlefield thing because honestly I have no authority whatsoever to speak on that subject but it I just in general it's a it's a tough year for for for game awards and all that because there's so much good shit this year it has really been a great year for games as it should be I mean the systems have been out how long you know this is the years where they're really perfecting these systems I expect next year should kick a lot of ass too
I mean, yeah, you're right.
I mean, Mass Effect 3 is like, what, a month away from now?
That's right.
Yeah, those games aren't afraid to release in January.
Yeah, of course.
I mean, they have very little competition for movies since that's a dumping ground for those films anyways.
Yeah, it's a smart time to release a game.
Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that yeah, this was a pretty good year for video gaming in recent memory.
Oh yeah, pretty much so.
And hopefully next year, whatever they release, whatever they come out with, at that point they're going to start, you know, I'm more concerned about Nintendo.
Like, they better start pulling rabbits out of their hat to replace their aging Wii.
Well, Wii U next year.
Yeah, they can pull it off if the rumors aren't true that their dev units are even, are just like, not even up to par yet.
Well, keep in mind, too, 3DS, thanks to the two strong releases, has gained a lot of steam, which I think we all saw coming.
We knew they had to pull it out this holiday season, and I think they've succeeded to an extent with the two big releases.
I don't know what the final word is on how much it's sold, but I think they're saying already it's sold more than the DS did in its first year.
Now, granted, it's a little bit apple to oranges because the 3DS should have the DS's inertia to piggyback on, but...
I think, all in all, the 3DS is not going away anytime soon.
Right, and then obviously it still has to contend with the Vita and then all the new powerful smartphones that are coming out within the next year.
I kind of think there's room for both the 3DS and the Vita.
I don't think they're going to bite from each other that much.
What about the third one, the mobile game market?
The fact that the smartphones out there are pretty much not only matching but exceeding their specs.
I don't know I wonder if Angry Birds would count since they already have it on PSP
I'm not big on Angry Birds it's not to say mobile phone games are bad because there's a lot of good ones out there but most mobile phone games are kind of developed for mobile phones and they kind of like the handheld game and mobile phones are kind of two separate worlds for me but I get how the two can cannibalize from each other as well I get how mobile phone is kicking Nintendo in the pants a little bit because Angry Birds is 99 cents and Mario Kart's 40
I mean, alright, on one hand, you have like a system that's basically... You're right, it's touchscreen.
It's not the best thing for hardcore gamers.
But at the end of the day, they have, you know, the platforms that they're running on, not only iPhone and Android, they're just like...
They're getting out these systems for about the same price, but it's something that you're going to carry with every day and going to use in an emergency, in addition to just playing Angry Birds or any other hot game right now.
Even me, for example, I bought SimCity for $0.10 today from the Android market where they had that little sale.
I'm kicking myself because I missed out on Minecraft earlier last week.
Mirror's Edge was free on iOS this weekend, by the way.
I don't know if it still is.
I grabbed it when it was, so yay me.
There are certain games I would play on the Android market.
It's just a matter of the ones that I'm willing to shell out money for.
Those are pretty much rare, aside from Angry Birds and TapTap.
If they had something like SimCity or maybe a strategy game where you move around units, not like a castle defense game, but something like a StarCraft or a Command & Conquer clone, then I could definitely see myself playing that on the subways.
Hey, I work really hard all the time.
Excuse me Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Quickly with these last few tweets Loki left the room for a minute but we'll get him to do the last few last minute stories TigerClaw wanted to send us a link that talks about layoffs at THQ's UDraw division Yep, it looks like some layoffs have happened over there 30 employees were laid off on Friday and layoffs are never good news but at the same time
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And they actually mentioned, she actually said, Oh, we just bought last Christmas' U-Draw tablet, but we never play it.
So it's kind of one of those, you know, oops, the inertia wasn't strong enough to keep the U-Draw thing going.
Sounds like.
Yep, so there it went.
Goodbye.
And from Ranma tweets us, On the hooves of the popular cartoon, we have My Little Pony, Fighting is Magic.
My Little Pony Fighting Game
All right, one more tweet.
I'm going to sneak in one more tweet here from Ziba.
I like Ziba, and she's psychic because she knew it from my teaser tweets.
She knew about the whole umlaut thing.
She guessed it.
Ziba says, OLR, I recently downloaded Snoopy Street Fair on the App Store.
It's really fun.
If you are a Snoopy or Peanuts fan, get it.
I like Snoopy.
I wonder if it's like an action-y game or a puzzle game.
I'll have to find out more about it.
So there you go.
That's going to do it for tweets tonight.
Let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.
Loki.
Q Entertainment has revealed 99 Nights Online This is a 2D action MMO
It's interesting that this game refuses to go anywhere, yet we have such a hard time getting Xenoblade over here.
Just saying.
It looks very much like a lot of the 2D games that come over from Vanillaware and stuff like that.
Neat, I guess.
I don't know if that's actually coming out over here, though.
I think it's only in Japan, but pretty cool.
And then, I mean, this is just annoying, but apparently there's been a quote from
Capcom, Christian Svensson, who is the Vice President of Strategic Planning and Marketing Development, of course, commenting on Mega Man Legends 3, saying that, you know,
What was the actual quote here?
That Mega Man is still a key brand for them.
And that, you know, I guess basically promising that their fans that there will be a Mega Man game possibly coming out.
They're considering Mega Man's future.
How nice of you to give it some thought.
To take pittance on us commoners.
To allow us an audience with the king.
We're considering it, even though there's this big fan campaign to get another game.
We're considering, you know, being nice.
How bad do you want it, boys?
Seriously, and with that, as much as Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome, I can't support that kind of thing, so I don't know if I'd buy it.
I don't know.
It's a shame how that has all been ruined.
Now, I'm sure you're aware of Just Dance and how it's a popular franchise.
A lot of these smaller developers out there like to knock off this game and put out their own dancing game.
So, one of these companies, Oxygen Games, I believe, or OG International, which sounds a little bit funnier, they have a game called Get Up and Dance.
And
it's really hilarious actually I gotta show you I forgot to pull up the the other screenshot but basically the game looks almost exactly I mean straight down to the art style like Just Dance 3 but
Anyways, there was this court case from Ubisoft suing the company saying that you guys can't release this because this is violating copyright.
Basically, you're just creating a game that's exactly the same as ours.
Wait, did you say the game is called Get Up and Dance?
Get Up and Dance.
Because there's a total Bomani joke in there.
Did you get it?
Yes.
Anyway, so the court, though, has allowed, because Ubisoft, one of the things they wanted to do was put a temporary restraining order on the publisher to not be able to put this game out.
So they have been denied.
Ubisoft cannot restrain the release of this game.
It's supposed to be published in North America on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
Of course, you know, PlayStation 3 being the Moved version.
but yes the game looks exactly I mean straight down the artwork exactly like Just Dance of course will not sell as well as Just Dance alright that's it for last minute stories alright there's at least three people who get the joke I can count at least three people in chat who should understand that joke at least alright

DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.
Your final thought.
Um, I really have an obsession with fab.com lately, but I can't afford anything there except for my Helveta cards.
My final thought is, um, I want at least one piece of tier 13 looking for raid by this time next week.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is I've been looking for some good cage match songs and I found one.
All right.
That's going to do it.
