WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Today, December 11th, 2011, an official Xbox Live app shows up on Apple devices.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.720
One of the Operation Rainfall games is announced for release in Europe, and Metal Gear meets

00:24.720 --> 00:31.640
Bayonetta in a new game trailer.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.880
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.880 --> 00:38.840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.840 --> 00:45.860
We are live tonight with the 438th episode of our show on this December the 11th of 2011.

00:45.860 --> 00:49.740
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as she always does week in and week out, say

00:49.740 --> 00:53.720
hello to one of my co-hosts, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.720
Roar.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
Roar!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
How are you doing?

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
Roar.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
You are a beast tonight.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
I am.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
Roar.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
No, I'm doing-

01:01.720 --> 01:02.720
Oh, now you're a sexy beast.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
I'm always a sexy beast.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
What are you talking about?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.960
Except, you know, I'm really not.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
I was today.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.840
Talking about your outfit on Thursday, which we'll get to in a minute, that was, you were

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
a little bit of a sexy beast.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.840
I like that outfit.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.840
Oh, thank you.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.840
You were rocking the flower in your hair.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
I like that.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.240
Even though my makeup got all screwed up by the end of the night.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.680
Alright, we'll come back to Thursday in a minute, but first I've got to introduce the

01:20.680 --> 01:25.320
other co-hosts who's here week in and week out, always find fast food dining when it

01:25.320 --> 01:27.160
comes to six o'clock for our show.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.120
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.800
It wasn't, it was out of necessity because all the other places had longer lines.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.440
Oh, and the fast food choice for tonight is?

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
McDonald's.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.440
Alright, which does not service-

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
That's not food.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
It's, it's, it's-

01:41.440 --> 01:43.520
Does not service an official endorsement of the program by any means.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.800
No, I want, I am not endorsing McDonald's, that's for sure.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.520
No, I've been actually trying to shy away from McDonald's, but the problem is on the

01:51.520 --> 01:56.000
way to this show, it's like, okay, you've got Carl's Jr., Burger King, and McDonald's

01:56.000 --> 01:59.040
and Carl's Jr. had a line of seven cars.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.540
I didn't want to go to, I just decided not to go to Burger King cause it's kind of hard

02:02.540 --> 02:06.000
to get into that parking lot, out of that parking lot.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
But-

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
These are real problems, people.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.480
And I had Burger King for like the last two days, so, you know, but they're chef's choice

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
burger, man.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
It's good shit.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.200
That is some good stuff.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.480
This however, not good stuff, and this would be the double quarter pounder that they made

02:20.480 --> 02:21.480
completely weird.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.480
What?

02:22.480 --> 02:23.480
No McRib?

02:23.480 --> 02:25.520
Dude, the McRib is nasty, okay?

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
I'm sorry.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.520
McRib is not-

02:27.520 --> 02:28.520
No, I know.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.520
The McRib is nasty.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
But it's all everyone ever talks about.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.760
Have you actually ever read the nutritional information on that?

02:32.760 --> 02:33.760
No thank you.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.760
That's because there isn't any.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
Ha ha.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.760
No, it's, it's there.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.440
It's just not very nutritional.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.660
Alright look, I gotta, believe it or not we're a podcast about video games and live show,

02:42.660 --> 02:43.840
not just food.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.880
But let me introduce the chatters.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.440
I have to introduce of course our chat room, the lovely folks that join us week in and

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
week out live.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.400
Because of course we are live at All Games Radio, which we are every Sunday night at

02:53.400 --> 02:57.200
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.780
And if you want to join us in the chat room, just point your browsers to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

03:03.780 --> 03:06.720
Or of course if you have an IRC client, you can get on that way too by connecting to the

03:06.720 --> 03:10.600
Game Church network and it's Channel Orange Lounge, but most people just prefer the easy

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
way out.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
So there you go.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
Choose whatever way you wanna do.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.280
Come talk with us.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.560
And some folks in there are talking about retweeting the show status.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.640
Good, good, good idea.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.440
Thank you for helping to promote the show.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
Appreciate it.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.720
And then MPRA2 is saying, well, back to Battlefield 3.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.960
Sorry, OLR, I gotta unlock fire extinguisher for my jets.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.640
So I guess we lost out to Battlefield tonight.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.640
That makes me sad.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.480
A lot of people have been playing Battlefield.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.960
I always go on to see what everyone else is playing.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.960
Very tempted.

03:39.960 --> 03:40.960
A lot of times I see Saints Row.

03:40.960 --> 03:47.920
I could go play some Saints Row, but Skyrim is, I need to do meaningless tasks in Skyrim.

03:47.920 --> 03:52.840
Well, I was gonna say, no matter which friends list we're talking about, on my 360, everybody's

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
playing Skyrim.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.120
On my PlayStation 3, everybody's playing Skyrim.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.120
Like it really is...

03:57.120 --> 03:59.360
Nah, last night it was all Battlefield 3.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.780
Do you know what consistently, again, between the two systems is number one though?

04:02.780 --> 04:05.640
What I see people on more than anything else on the systems?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.280
The answer's easier than you think.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.280
Modern Warfare 3?

04:08.280 --> 04:09.280
Netflix.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.760
Ah, yeah.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.760
Even though...

04:11.760 --> 04:12.880
Well, let's talk about this a little bit.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.280
Let's get into games a little bit.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.780
Talk about the new Xbox remodel that happened this week, because they launched the new Xbox

04:19.780 --> 04:20.780
dashboard.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.040
What do they call it?

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
The Xbox dashboard?

04:23.040 --> 04:25.040
Is that what it's called?

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
Experience?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.040
Experience?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.040
I don't know what it is.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.040
It's technically a dashboard, but...

04:29.040 --> 04:30.320
So I guess what they're trying to do is they're trying to...

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
Call it boring.

04:31.320 --> 04:35.520
Well, they're trying to integrate Kinect more into it, and have it be that way, but...

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
Whoopty shit.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.520
Here it is.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.960
Long story short, look, if you have a 360, you've probably already seen it.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.280
The entire internet was trying to download it that day, and it was delayed, et cetera,

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
et cetera.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.280
Everybody's seen it by now, but I gotta be honest, eh...

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
It's prettier.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
I'll give it that.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.120
The ads kind of stick out a lot more.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.120
I noticed that too right away.

04:55.120 --> 05:02.080
But it's really built for the Kinect, and I just think it's kind of eh...

05:02.080 --> 05:03.080
Not a big fan of it.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.660
I mean, the Kinect's cool and all, but I don't want it shoved down my throat, and I kind

05:06.660 --> 05:10.800
of feel like this new Xbox redesign kind of really shoves the Kinect down your throat,

05:10.800 --> 05:14.880
and like, I don't know about you guys, but in my apartment, the Xbox is not always that

05:14.880 --> 05:15.880
res...

05:15.880 --> 05:18.960
Or Kinect and all that is not always that responsive, and I don't wanna use it.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.280
I mean, it's fine if I light things up to play Dance Central or whatever, but in my

05:23.280 --> 05:25.960
low-lit apartment otherwise, I don't like to try and use Kinect.

05:25.960 --> 05:31.320
I understand people, you know, think it's cool, and by people like me and Microsoft,

05:31.320 --> 05:36.480
think it's cool to have voice commands and Kinect commands and stuff like that for all

05:36.480 --> 05:37.520
the stuff in there.

05:37.520 --> 05:42.560
You can wave your hand back and forth to scroll through the pages.

05:42.560 --> 05:49.480
Or I can take less time, a fraction of a second less, to move my thumb slightly to the left

05:49.480 --> 05:54.320
or right on my analog stick to do the exact same thing.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.640
It's just like...

05:56.640 --> 05:57.640
I don't understand...

05:57.640 --> 06:02.640
I mean, yeah, you gotta support the Kinect, and that's fine that you wanna add more connectivity

06:02.640 --> 06:08.960
to the dashboard, but I just...

06:08.960 --> 06:14.320
I think it's unnecessary, and it's kind of a step backwards for a lot of things.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.600
It made a lot of stuff a lot harder to find.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.400
I mean, there's pros and there's cons.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.360
On the one hand, it's really easy, like if I think of an old game that's on my Xbox that

06:22.360 --> 06:28.720
I wanna play, like let's say Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, I can go play that game, which

06:28.720 --> 06:32.440
maybe I haven't played in a long time, but otherwise, kind of digging through my collection

06:32.440 --> 06:38.200
is a lot of key presses to get to, because you have to kind of scroll over.

06:38.200 --> 06:43.880
It does kind of like that, it's a crossbar but not really thing, where I just...

06:43.880 --> 06:45.520
It's weird.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
I don't really like...

06:46.520 --> 06:50.020
I mean, it's prettier, but in practicality, it's kind of an annoyance.

06:50.020 --> 06:54.480
I think a lot of stuff's harder to find, although you have Bing if you know what you're looking

06:54.480 --> 06:56.480
for.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.880
Bing does not search the internet.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.560
I think a lot of people assumed, because Bing is like a competitor to Google, that you'd

07:01.560 --> 07:05.600
be able to like Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, and you get taken to our website, but now

07:05.600 --> 07:08.640
no, if you try to Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think you get anything at all, because

07:08.640 --> 07:09.640
we don't...

07:09.640 --> 07:13.320
The icons that used to be up on the marketplace have been long gone.

07:13.320 --> 07:20.800
The all games icons, they took down when the avatars launched, so you can still use them

07:20.800 --> 07:21.800
if you have them.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.680
Rob, you made me laugh just now.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.680
Why?

07:24.680 --> 07:25.680
What'd I do?

07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
Magic the Gathering.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.840
I don't know why I was thinking about that game the other day, and I'm not even talking

07:28.840 --> 07:32.560
about Magic 2012, but there's like an older one, and I don't know.

07:32.560 --> 07:38.000
Actually, here's what's funny, actually, on that kind of same note, like how this whole

07:38.000 --> 07:42.680
thing has broken the Xbox, I tried to play the older Magic the Gathering game, because

07:42.680 --> 07:45.000
I bought that first one that came out on Xbox Live some time ago.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I don't know why.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.200
Sometimes you get a bug, and you just want to play a certain game, right?

07:49.200 --> 07:50.920
You play shit tons of classic games.

07:50.920 --> 07:51.920
Why?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.620
Because you think about it, and you're like, I want to frickin' play that game.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.680
So I wanted to play the Magic game.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.600
So I go, Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, and it finds it, and I go, okay, I'm going

07:58.600 --> 08:04.040
into the game, and it launches the game, and it says, you need an update to play this game.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.760
This update is no longer available, and it clits the game.

08:07.760 --> 08:14.400
So this game I bought for ten bucks, maybe a year ago, like I can't play anymore because

08:14.400 --> 08:18.440
they decided to remove the update, is like this trying to force me into the 2012 version

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
of the game.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
I don't even know.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.440
That kind of irritated me.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.440
Technically we could get you the update, but I mean, it's still a pain in the ass to do

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
that.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.360
It's just me meaning, you know, download it from the internet, but I shouldn't have to

08:31.360 --> 08:32.360
do that, right?

08:32.360 --> 08:33.360
That's right.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.360
It should just work.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.240
So anyway, I kind of think the new Xbox experience will end.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.240
The whole reason I brought it up in the first place, going back to chat, and chat reminded

08:40.240 --> 08:44.960
me of this, is that they took out the party feature from Netflix, which is kind of one

08:44.960 --> 08:49.040
of the deals that people really loved about Netflix on the Xbox 360 is that it had the

08:49.040 --> 08:52.640
party mode, and of course they're not really saying why.

08:52.640 --> 08:57.880
And this just kind of further down that spiral of, boy, Netflix had to make a lot of unpopular

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
decisions this year.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.960
And I'm not saying it's necessarily their fault, because I think they're feeling a lot

09:01.960 --> 09:06.640
of pressures from movie studios and things like that, you know, as movie studios are

09:06.640 --> 09:10.800
finally realizing, oh shit, the internet really is the wave of the future.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.900
They're kind of having to adapt to it.

09:11.900 --> 09:16.480
So I'm thinking the movie studio is probably pressured into removing the party feature,

09:16.480 --> 09:17.960
because it never showed up on any other console.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.400
Yeah, because if you think about it, oh, I want to watch a movie with my friends.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.520
Well if you want to watch a movie with your friends, you're going to go buy the damn DVD.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.400
That's what the movie studio is thinking, probably.

09:26.400 --> 09:31.800
Yeah, it's a little weird, but there were some people that really liked that feature

09:31.800 --> 09:33.120
that it got taken away.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.900
I didn't realize how many people were using it until I saw the QQing on my Twitter.

09:36.900 --> 09:44.360
So they made indie games harder to find, also.

09:44.360 --> 09:48.800
I just, you know, download whatever I'm going to watch, and then watch it with a couple

09:48.800 --> 09:50.800
of friends on AIM.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.120
But I mean, I guess it was the same thing.

09:52.120 --> 09:57.480
Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I really want to watch games, I mean, technically, technically, couldn't

09:57.480 --> 10:00.880
I, and I don't know if this is possible, maybe the chat can help me out here, couldn't I

10:00.880 --> 10:07.000
open up the Xbox party and open up one of those cross-game chat dealies, and then go

10:07.000 --> 10:11.120
onto Netflix and say, okay, on the count of three, press the start button, one, two, three,

10:11.120 --> 10:12.120
start.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.640
Or, because it wouldn't really work, because people's bandwidth might be different, or...

10:15.640 --> 10:16.880
I don't know, it might...

10:16.880 --> 10:18.240
I would think you could still kind of do it.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.240
You could wait five seconds before commenting or something, I don't know.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.960
This is weird.

10:22.960 --> 10:28.600
So, anyway, so the new Xbox experience gets up from me.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.360
Other stuff going on in the gaming world this week before we get into specifically what

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
games we've been playing this week.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.920
Of course, Dark Soccer and I already made reference to this earlier in the show.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.740
We went to UMLoud on Thursday, which we've been trying to tell you guys on the show for

10:38.740 --> 10:42.920
weeks and weeks now, like, check it out, go if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, or

10:42.920 --> 10:47.600
check it out online at umloud.org, and thank you, Oil Army, you were noticed in the chat

10:47.600 --> 10:48.840
room during the pre-show.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.200
I was not able to see chat myself from where I was, but I had the word passed along that

10:54.200 --> 10:58.360
people were saying hello and stuff, so I really appreciate you guys showing up in force.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.600
I hope some of you guys were able to donate to what is a great cause.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.360
But who wants backstage gossip from the show?

11:04.360 --> 11:07.040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, me, me, me, me, me, me.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.200
I don't have negative stuff to say, no, I had a great time.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.800
And so I'm sure those of you that watch the video feed, and if you haven't seen the video

11:14.800 --> 11:18.660
feed yet, you can check it out, it is archived at umloud.org, and it takes you to the little

11:18.660 --> 11:25.280
Ustream archived presentation, which was part of Game Spots, I guess, providing the bandwidth

11:25.280 --> 11:27.560
or what have you for that whole thing.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.260
You know, there were some audio problems in the beginning, which, you know, just my luck,

11:31.260 --> 11:34.400
my first live shot's gonna go wrong, or something like that.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.160
So it was very nerve-wracking, but at the end I was feeling a lot better with the interviews

11:38.160 --> 11:44.000
and so forth, and people were very complimentary, so I was very happy, and got a lot of people

11:44.000 --> 11:47.760
to come out and donate, which is the most important thing of all, of course, the donation.

11:47.760 --> 11:53.920
But I just wanted to say, you know, despite all the technical things that happened, you

11:53.920 --> 11:58.240
guys wouldn't believe how much change is on the fly when we're doing live stuff, especially

11:58.240 --> 11:59.440
video from a big event.

11:59.440 --> 12:05.720
I mean, OLR is one thing, this live environment, this hasn't bothered me for a long time, I

12:05.720 --> 12:11.900
mean, this is kind of like my element, but doing video was a very, very interesting experience.

12:11.900 --> 12:17.240
But having the very professional people from the AV Society that were helping to put it

12:17.240 --> 12:21.560
on was such a relief, because, like, truly, and I'm not just saying this to kiss ass because

12:21.560 --> 12:27.040
I truly, truly feel this way, like, everybody was super professional and just super awesome.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
And were people stressed out?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
Sure.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.240
I mean, there was a lot to get stressed out about.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.240
Some guests weren't there, and some video clips weren't around, you know, it stings.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.440
We get stressed out at OLR when the internet goes down and we can't do our show like we

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
planned.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.560
You know, things happen, but it's kind of the way that people kind of react to those

12:42.560 --> 12:44.320
change and still interact with each other.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.120
I just really felt there was still like a really high level of professionalism.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.320
So I just got to give kudos to all those people that put it on.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.840
I mean, was it scary?

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
Yes.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
But was it rewarding?

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
Absolutely.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
Absolutely.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.440
So I had a fantastic time.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
And you were cute.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.440
Your hat was cute.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
Thank you.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.440
Thank you.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.440
Thank you.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.440
Thank you.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.440
I have a little thread.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
Yes.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.680
A coworker went shopping with me the other night.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.440
We bought an all new outfit, so I'm like, oh, I like that shirt, but I understand Alan

13:11.440 --> 13:12.440
stealing it from you.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.440
Yes.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.440
Yes.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.520
That's what happens is that, you know, I buy a shirt and then, you know, Alan says, no,

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
I want that shirt.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
Steal.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.720
No, I'm wearing the shirt that I bought for that night, but I really just bought it to

13:22.720 --> 13:29.180
wear under that, uh, my hoodie, uh, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

13:29.180 --> 13:31.520
Kaijuto says no cat fights backstage.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
No, no.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
It's all in the name of charity.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
Actually.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
I gotta say this.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.520
This is the cool thing is that, you know, and I was mentioning this a little bit.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.320
On the call on Bobby show is that, you know, one of the other co-hosts was really well

13:41.320 --> 13:46.200
known on Twitch TV and it was streamed on Ustream and you had people behind the scenes

13:46.200 --> 13:50.520
from GameSpot and IGN, but you know what, at the end of the day, who cares?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Who cares?

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
It's for charity.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.900
Like, you know, day jobs and all those allegiances and so forth are one thing and the communities

13:55.900 --> 13:59.840
we're into, but at the end of the day, it isn't about us and about our ego.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.800
Everybody really did truly check those in at the door because it was about the charity.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.080
And I honestly, the people I was working with anyway, I don't think have ego anyway.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.880
So you know, I didn't sense that at all.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.680
I ran into one thing that I'm really not going to discuss, but I think I did a very fluid

14:15.680 --> 14:19.360
sidestep of drama.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.640
Well you know why I say fluid?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.240
Because I drank.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.040
Anytime you get a group of nerds together, it's always bound to be a hilarious time.

14:27.040 --> 14:32.480
Anyhow, going to our other chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw says everyone loved your beard Rob.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.080
You know, Tiger Claw, I seem to remember you specifically thought the beard was weird at

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
first.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.440
So I'm glad you've come full circle and come to embrace the beard that I started a couple

14:40.440 --> 14:41.440
months ago.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.720
I appreciate it.

14:43.720 --> 14:48.040
Let's see, going back to our chat room, Act Def says, I did watch UMLoud live.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.360
I did see the last part of the pre-show.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
Well, thank you.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.360
It was good times.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.360
It was really good times.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.100
And they actually, it wasn't just the pre-show they broadcast live, but they broadcast the

14:55.100 --> 14:56.540
whole thing, all the bands.

14:56.540 --> 15:01.380
And I got to say, just hilarious, imaginative bands.

15:01.380 --> 15:05.760
And if you missed us talking about what UMLoud is on last week's show, in a nutshell, people

15:05.760 --> 15:10.560
pay money to play rock band on an actual concert stage.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.360
And so of course they go all out and all the money goes to the Child's Play charity.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.520
I liked the Aperture band.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.960
Oh yeah, the one that was all dressed up like Devo, the Devoid or whatever, that was phenomenal.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.160
And even that very first band that came out after the introduction, they were all dressed

15:24.160 --> 15:28.000
up like Harry Potter characters and they did You Oughta Know for whatever reason.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
But I was like, they're Gryffindor kids singing You Oughta Know.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
It's funny.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
That was pretty funny.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
But it was, it's great.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.940
Everybody went all out and you know what, I'll tell you this, here's something you didn't

15:40.940 --> 15:44.360
hear on the pre-show literally because the mic was dead.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.760
The first guy I'm interviewing, you don't unfortunately hear that interview at all because

15:47.760 --> 15:50.320
the mic wasn't working and it had to do with the wireless.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.360
You'll notice it switches from a wireless to a wired because for whatever reason the

15:53.360 --> 15:55.200
wireless connection just died.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.960
But the first guy I'm interviewing, he actually talked about his band.

15:57.960 --> 16:02.960
He was in the band Gay Riot was the name of the band and they were doing a David Bowie

16:02.960 --> 16:03.960
song.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.040
But it was really funny when we were talking about it because I said, well, he said the

16:07.040 --> 16:09.520
lead singer was going to dress up like David Bowie.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.120
And I said, I said, well, you know, where's he getting the idea or whatever?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
Where'd you guys get this idea?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.200
And he said, oh, well, his girlfriend put him up to it.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.040
I said, so you guys are called Gay Riot, but David Bowie's girlfriend put him up to it.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
He's like, yep.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.040
I said, well, with David Bowie, you never can tell these things.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.320
So there's something you missed out on by there not being audio.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.900
That was, that was a fun interview.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.620
I feel sorry for that guy.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.620
They were all good sports.

16:29.620 --> 16:35.240
These people completely pulled, like for real, like I will admit, like the raffle fairy,

16:35.240 --> 16:36.600
Amanda, she's a good friend of mine.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.380
So I, of course I wanted to bring her on, but a lot of those people were complete strangers

16:41.380 --> 16:43.460
and really good sports and some great interviews.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.200
I had a fun time.

16:45.200 --> 16:50.880
I had a good time too, because I got, I was helping to test out the free play setup, which

16:50.880 --> 16:54.840
I set up half of it before my hand said no.

16:54.840 --> 16:58.000
And um, you were singing a lot of songs in there before they opened the doors.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.040
I heard, yeah, well, I always have to, I can't use earplugs because they always make my ears

17:04.040 --> 17:10.680
hurt more for some reason, but I have this fear of being out of key, which people who

17:10.680 --> 17:13.120
know me know why I have that problem.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.880
So I was trying to make sure everything was set up and finally there was this one dude

17:17.880 --> 17:23.040
in there who was a super cool and we played a band on the run and that made me happy because

17:23.040 --> 17:27.520
anyone who appreciates Paul McCartney in the wings is cool in my book.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.520
All right.

17:28.520 --> 17:32.160
Go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com.

17:32.160 --> 17:36.540
Tiger Claw says, Rob, it would have been great if you got on stage and sang some of the songs.

17:36.540 --> 17:41.420
You know, I, I would have done it, but I wasn't sure if I could because of the other stuff

17:41.420 --> 17:45.040
I was doing, but I think in retrospect, I probably still would have just been able to

17:45.040 --> 17:47.100
buy a band spot and been on at the end.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.080
So maybe next year, like I'm not opposed to it.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
It's for a good cause.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
It's a great thing.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.080
We bought raffle tickets.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.400
I, we, Alan and I won a raffle prize.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.920
I haven't got to play it yet because, um, we had, we had to leave before it was over

17:59.920 --> 18:03.700
because keep in mind, San Francisco is a two hour drive and I had to work the next day

18:03.700 --> 18:05.580
with a morning meeting.

18:05.580 --> 18:11.240
So we won the raffle prize late, but we won some fishing game on the way from the raffle,

18:11.240 --> 18:13.840
but we bought a handful of raffle tickets and walked out of there with that.

18:13.840 --> 18:19.440
So anyway, I, I won't talk about it all night, but it was a incredible time.

18:19.440 --> 18:24.540
Met a lot of great people, um, can't wait for next year and, um, go watch the live feed

18:24.540 --> 18:26.400
and if you like it, fricking donate.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
It's a great cause.

18:27.400 --> 18:32.940
I mean, remember there's a lot of kids in hospitals that would just love to have just

18:32.940 --> 18:37.100
any some of these expensive systems we talk about, like three DS and some of this stuff,

18:37.100 --> 18:40.680
you know, even if they're too young to enjoy this stuff, child's play goes so far to get

18:40.680 --> 18:42.360
like coloring books and things like that.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.620
You know, remember this is just a really tough time of year.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.720
You know, a lot of kids, you know, sometimes don't easily have access to that stuff when

18:49.720 --> 18:51.160
they're going through a really hard time.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.760
So child's play kind of helps deliver that.

18:52.760 --> 18:53.960
So just think about that.

18:53.960 --> 18:54.960
No stuffed animals.

18:54.960 --> 19:00.520
It's actually the only thing, um, if you're going to donate a toy, do not donate a stuffed

19:00.520 --> 19:02.640
animal because they do carry germs.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
Interesting.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
It has to be something that can be sterilized.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.040
I didn't think about that.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
I just donate money.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
Yeah.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
Money.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Money's good.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.040
So, all right.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.040
Anyhow, uh, umlab.org.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.880
So how about our gaming weeks?

19:13.880 --> 19:18.480
Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week and enjoying, um, in

19:18.480 --> 19:20.880
our time that we're not trying to raise money for charity.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.880
Dark Sakura?

19:22.880 --> 19:23.880
I'm sorry.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.880
What?

19:24.880 --> 19:25.880
How was your gaming week?

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
That's the question.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.880
I know.

19:27.880 --> 19:28.880
That was my answer.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.880
Um, what?

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
You played rock band.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
I played rock band.

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
I played some well.

19:32.880 --> 19:38.820
I was going to play dance masters yesterday, um, but I was feeling really crappy.

19:38.820 --> 19:39.820
Really crap.

19:39.820 --> 19:40.820
I was bugging you to do that too.

19:40.820 --> 19:41.820
You were.

19:41.820 --> 19:42.820
I was gonna.

19:42.820 --> 19:46.880
I was gonna do everything and then I was like, I got out of my seat and everything.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.080
No, I was going to go in and set it up and then I was just not feeling well.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.080
We had a busy beginning of the week cause I know you had a lot of rush design projects

19:54.080 --> 19:56.700
and I had a lot of design to do.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.800
I had, um, I had umlaude.

19:59.800 --> 20:04.960
I had the American river review release party, which by the way, the 2012 American river

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
review is out.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.840
If you go to arc.losrios.edu and go to the bookstore link, you can order a copy.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.200
So if our international audience wants to see what the local community college here

20:15.200 --> 20:16.200
tell.

20:16.200 --> 20:21.920
I'm going to, I'm going to tell why people internationally will like it because it actually

20:21.920 --> 20:30.080
wins national awards, beats out the big four year schools and has some amazing literature

20:30.080 --> 20:34.280
and artwork in it this year and culinary recipes, which I laid out.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.960
Look at you showing your college pride.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
I love it.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
I'm pretty proud of it.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
You should be.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.640
Well, ARC is like the biggest, um, junior college in California.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.720
Is there any video gaming content in the magazine?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.860
Not quite, but there's plenty of pop culture.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.860
Maybe you should.

20:48.860 --> 20:50.960
That should be something you should think about for next year.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
Just saying.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.440
Well, I'm hoping next year we actually get some of the 3d modelers putting their stuff

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
in.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
Okay.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.440
Well that's cool.

20:58.440 --> 21:04.320
Because like, well when I took the 3d class, I did a turret from portal.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.320
I remember that.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.120
That was a really cute little thing you did.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.320
And other people have done, you know, different.

21:09.320 --> 21:15.200
One person did a Game Boy Advance, you know, so I'm saying you get, there's, um, there's

21:15.200 --> 21:16.200
definitely references.

21:16.200 --> 21:20.840
I mean, a lot of the stories in there, there's definitely a few, uh, geeks doing the writing.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.720
So but I think that it's worthwhile.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.960
So really that's what my, um, that and UmLoud have really been what's taken up the bulk

21:27.960 --> 21:28.960
of my week.

21:28.960 --> 21:36.400
Not really specifically gaming, but it's been two worthy things that I was proud to have

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
been involved in this week.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
All right.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
That's good to me.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
Fair compromise.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.400
Loki, how about you?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.280
You sadly couldn't make it to UmLoud because you know you have other obligations, but what

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
did you do this week?

21:45.280 --> 21:49.860
Uh, I played Skyrim, mostly.

21:49.860 --> 21:56.640
And I swear I waste so much time doing meaningless tasks like item management and what I can

21:56.640 --> 21:57.640
carry with me.

21:57.640 --> 22:04.680
And I have, I was literally today spending time at the, uh, enchantment table or whatever

22:04.680 --> 22:13.520
to give my armor some extra, um, lifting abilities so I can just carry more crap with me as I'm

22:13.520 --> 22:14.520
going around.

22:14.520 --> 22:19.760
Um, I did one of the quests, which was, uh, I think it was called a night to remember

22:19.760 --> 22:20.920
or something like that.

22:20.920 --> 22:27.120
And where you get drunk and somehow end up like on the completely other side of the world.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.520
And that's kind of what happened.

22:28.520 --> 22:34.400
And so I've been journeying my way back, but thankfully I could fast travel back to Whiterun

22:34.400 --> 22:40.480
to dump my crap into a cabinet, which this cabinet must have an infinite amount of space

22:40.480 --> 22:41.480
because I...

22:41.480 --> 22:42.480
It's a big cabinet.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
It's a very big cabinet.

22:43.480 --> 22:47.840
What you don't see in Skyrim is that at the other end of the cabinet is the door to Narnia.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.960
So you just have all of Narnia to store your shit.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.440
It pretty much is like that.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.000
Um, and it was, it was...

22:56.000 --> 23:00.920
Black Wolf in our chat room says, Loki was lollygagging.

23:00.920 --> 23:07.600
And it's funny though, cause like I had to dump off, like I had 150 carrots, 150 carrots

23:07.600 --> 23:08.800
for no reason whatsoever.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.180
You wascally wabbit.

23:10.180 --> 23:14.200
So the first thing I started doing is like, I'm going to eat all these carrots right now.

23:14.200 --> 23:19.080
So I was like hammering down A, but it just took forever to do that.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.080
Your skill in vitamin A has increased to 22.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.200
So I decided I'm going to make it rain.

23:25.200 --> 23:31.160
So I ran upstairs into this, like, uh, in this general goods store, ran upstairs to

23:31.160 --> 23:35.000
the balcony and I was going to throw the carrots off the balcony and want to see like a pile

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
of carrots.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
And you get a carrot!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
And you get a carrot!

23:38.000 --> 23:39.080
And you get a carrot!

23:39.080 --> 23:42.200
But no, unfortunately it doesn't do it like that.

23:42.200 --> 23:47.000
You would have to drop each one individually, um, because otherwise it drops them in piles

23:47.000 --> 23:49.320
of like 109 and stuff.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.480
It was very unepic.

23:51.480 --> 23:55.120
So um, so yeah, I didn't do that.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.760
But um, I don't know, I've just been playing a lot.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.680
I think I actually looked at my playtime, I have like 36 hours in the game, and I've

24:02.680 --> 24:03.920
done like nothing.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.520
And I've probably further progressed in the story than you.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.960
I've done like hardly anything in there.

24:08.960 --> 24:13.160
I like to go, I like to find the random dungeons, but then I'm like, oh I don't want to explore

24:13.160 --> 24:16.480
this dungeon because somebody in the nearby town might have a quest.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.280
So I need to go to the quest and talk to everybody until I find the, and then I'm picking every

24:20.280 --> 24:23.360
single fucking flower on the way because I can't stop!

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Yeah.

24:24.360 --> 24:29.640
And the game is horrible for people who have, like, because I go in with the JRPG mindset

24:29.640 --> 24:30.920
from Final Fantasy, right?

24:30.920 --> 24:34.640
Gotta find every treasure box, gotta open everything, gotta get every item, I want my

24:34.640 --> 24:37.160
perfect run through, 999 everything, right?

24:37.160 --> 24:39.840
Like you take that mindset to Skyrim, you are fucked.

24:39.840 --> 24:45.000
You'll never get anything done, and you will have 150 carrots in your goddamn bag because

24:45.000 --> 24:46.680
you picked every single one.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.880
Like that's...

24:47.880 --> 24:52.120
I go through all the towns searching the barrels, and I know very well that there's not gold

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
in those barrels.

24:53.120 --> 24:58.200
Like carrots, or apples, or tomatoes, or maybe cabbage that's worth nothing.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.280
Carrots are literally worth nothing, you cannot sell them for any money whatsoever.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.860
But you can eat them!

25:02.860 --> 25:05.260
You can eat them, or drop them on the ground.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.560
You know that if you eat too many carrots it will turn you orange?

25:08.560 --> 25:12.280
I shit you not, that happened to me when I was two, and I had to go to the ER.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.500
It's actually happened to several famous people, like one of them was, what was her name that

25:15.500 --> 25:17.720
played the older sister on the Partridge family?

25:17.720 --> 25:18.720
I don't know.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.480
Susan Day, wasn't that her?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.480
Okay, sure.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.200
But she ate nothing but carrots, like, and they had to tell her to stop eating carrots

25:25.200 --> 25:27.840
because she turned orange on screen.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.360
Come on, get orange!

25:29.360 --> 25:30.360
Trivia!

25:30.360 --> 25:31.360
But, um...

25:31.360 --> 25:35.240
If I'm ever on Useless Crap Jeopardy, I'll remember that.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.720
I'm trying to think if there's any other funny stuff that's happened, like, glitch-wise and

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
stuff.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.720
Because I know there has been.

25:41.720 --> 25:47.520
Uh, yeah, like, exploring random things, I went into a cottage, and there was this really

25:47.520 --> 25:49.720
powerful wizard in the cottage that wanted to kill me.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.520
I was like, oooookay.

25:52.520 --> 26:00.040
Um, or the, what is it, there's like some sort of, there's like so many bands of, like,

26:00.040 --> 26:03.920
I've lost track of all the different groups in the games, like, you know, they have the

26:03.920 --> 26:12.480
Imperials and the Stormcloaks, and then they have the, the, what was it, the Followers,

26:12.480 --> 26:17.960
or like, this is, and then some other weird band that's somewhere else that has these

26:17.960 --> 26:23.520
weird, like, bone weapons that, they apparently suck, though, because I kicked the crap out

26:23.520 --> 26:29.240
of them, but, um, yeah, so I played, basically I played lots of Skyrim, didn't really do

26:29.240 --> 26:34.120
much, um, in the game, other than, you know, going around.

26:34.120 --> 26:39.360
I did happen, though, I was walking along, and I saw these people wandering, there were

26:39.360 --> 26:44.520
traders that were bringing gifts for a wedding that was the cousin of, like, some head of

26:44.520 --> 26:46.960
the trade council or something like that.

26:46.960 --> 26:53.000
And so they're like, and they're basically like, oh, um, you know, we really should get

26:53.000 --> 26:58.080
on our way, and then one of the options was, I'm gonna take those gifts from you.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.000
So that's one of the options I did.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.480
And then I murdered them and stole their gifts.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.760
And I'm not, I think that's part of a quest, but I'm not really sure.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.000
Okay, last Skyrim thing, and then we've got to move on, okay?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.560
Well, someone actually did have a question.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
What?

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
In the chat?

27:10.560 --> 27:12.040
Yeah, did you offer the wizard carrots, Loki?

27:12.040 --> 27:16.040
Except I think it's a statement because he didn't use any, um, punctuation.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.040
Okay.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.040
No, I did not.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.040
All right.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
I got to play this.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.040
Bobby sent this to me.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
He said, don't play the sound.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
So I guess there's talking or whatever over it.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
But he says music.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.040
It's funny.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.040
Is it?

27:26.040 --> 27:27.040
Oh, you've heard this?

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
Yes.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.040
He says it's 2,500 cheese wheels rolling off a mountain.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
Let's see here.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
It's awesome.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
It's done with console commands.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
Okay.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.040
Oh, there they all go.

27:36.040 --> 27:42.040
That is a mountain of cheese.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.040
There's your whole.

27:43.040 --> 27:48.040
See, that's the kind of epic.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.220
What about this 4,200 cabbages going downhill in the related video?

27:52.220 --> 27:55.040
This is really fast forward over there.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.040
Oh, there they go.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.860
All the cabbages going downhill.

27:59.860 --> 28:00.860
That's not Skyrim music.

28:00.860 --> 28:01.860
What the hell is that?

28:01.860 --> 28:02.860
It's like.

28:02.860 --> 28:03.860
I don't know.

28:03.860 --> 28:04.860
It's like techno porn music.

28:04.860 --> 28:05.860
It's like porno music.

28:05.860 --> 28:08.860
That's tech demo music, Rob.

28:08.860 --> 28:13.860
If you like cabbages, that's like tech demo music, seriously, you like Skyrim.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.620
I got the video for you.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.620
Welcome to Skyrim Rob Live.

28:18.620 --> 28:22.620
I mentioned last week or maybe the week before last that once you do a few quests for people

28:22.620 --> 28:26.540
that all of a sudden they started trusting you with their possessions, which means that's

28:26.540 --> 28:31.260
the prime time to go clear out all the possessions out of their houses, including all the goblets

28:31.260 --> 28:32.260
and stuff.

28:32.260 --> 28:35.700
That's not even worth money, but because I'm a klepto, I have to take everything.

28:35.700 --> 28:39.860
I found out that after a while they restock all their stuff in their house.

28:39.860 --> 28:44.700
So I went to the castle again and took everything out of the castle again and then threw them

28:44.700 --> 28:45.700
off the mountain.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.700
All right.

28:46.700 --> 28:47.700
Can we move on?

28:47.700 --> 28:49.700
I want to talk about something other than Skyrim.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.420
Skyrim's been out almost a month now.

28:51.420 --> 28:53.580
Oh, and play lots of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare.

28:53.580 --> 28:54.580
It's awesome.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.580
All right.

28:55.580 --> 28:56.580
Actually, Skyrim's been out one month today.

28:56.580 --> 28:57.580
Today's December 11th.

28:57.580 --> 28:58.580
Anyway.

28:58.580 --> 28:59.580
All right.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.580
Other games.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.580
My gaming week.

29:01.580 --> 29:02.580
Yay.

29:02.580 --> 29:03.580
I'm going to talk about three games.

29:03.580 --> 29:04.580
Three new things I played this week.

29:04.580 --> 29:05.580
Okay.

29:05.580 --> 29:12.060
On the Xbox 360, I checked out Apples to Apples, which is the translation of the ever popular

29:12.060 --> 29:13.560
card party game.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
I don't even...

29:14.560 --> 29:16.940
I can't fathom how that works.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.860
Well, it's not like...

29:19.860 --> 29:21.700
It's pretty much what you'd think.

29:21.700 --> 29:25.000
If you're playing an Xbox Live, there's single player and then there's Xbox Live.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.580
So Xbox Live is the obvious mode, right?

29:27.580 --> 29:30.160
You go in and it goes around.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
It's just like the game.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.140
And if you've never played the game before, you have green cards which have words like...

29:35.140 --> 29:40.420
They're like adjectives, like depressing or things like that might be one of the green

29:40.420 --> 29:41.420
cards.

29:41.420 --> 29:47.180
And then the red cards all have nouns or time periods, celebrities, person place things

29:47.180 --> 29:48.220
type of stuff.

29:48.220 --> 29:52.760
And you have to play the card that you think the judge for that round who drew the green

29:52.760 --> 29:54.260
card will pick.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.260
And for example, one of the red cards is Helen Keller.

29:57.260 --> 29:58.740
And that will always win every round.

29:58.740 --> 30:02.540
And I'm proud to say Helen Keller is in the Apples to Apples 360 game.

30:02.540 --> 30:03.620
It had to be there.

30:03.620 --> 30:09.780
So if somebody plays the green card sassy and I play Helen Keller, then somebody might

30:09.780 --> 30:11.940
pick that as the winner.

30:11.940 --> 30:15.520
And then the winner gets a point and then whoever gets 5, 10 points, whatever the game's

30:15.520 --> 30:18.080
rules are first, wins the game.

30:18.080 --> 30:23.300
So that's cool and all, but it's Xbox Live and you never really know the people on Xbox

30:23.300 --> 30:24.300
Live.

30:24.300 --> 30:29.680
And what I notice is that political jokes on cards are really hard to make on Xbox Live

30:29.680 --> 30:31.560
because you might get a card.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.060
What was the one I got today?

30:33.060 --> 30:40.020
It was something like oppressive and somebody played Ronald Reagan and like, I thought it

30:40.020 --> 30:41.020
was funny.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.020
I'm like, I get it.

30:42.020 --> 30:46.020
I it's a joke, but somebody else is like, whatever, you know, and like it started this

30:46.020 --> 30:47.260
whole political discussion.

30:47.260 --> 30:50.420
I'm just like, come on, it's Apples to Apples people.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.420
This isn't fun.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.380
What about the single player?

30:53.380 --> 30:54.700
How the hell does that work?

30:54.700 --> 30:56.340
It's the single player is Boggle.

30:56.340 --> 30:57.660
You ever play Boggle?

30:57.660 --> 31:02.520
So you know that where you find the words in the mixed grid of letters.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.820
And so in the first few levels, you're just trying to figure out what red card would the

31:06.820 --> 31:08.700
computer pick.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.020
And it's really obvious.

31:10.020 --> 31:14.080
Like it's all these big stereotypes, like Helen Keller, no, the Apple might be dressed

31:14.080 --> 31:15.840
up like a princess.

31:15.840 --> 31:21.260
And so the card might be something like, you know, pretty and the cards you get are like

31:21.260 --> 31:26.300
nuclear war, uh, you know, oatmeal and diamonds.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.920
And so a princess of course is going to pick diamonds.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.540
So you have to find in the board D I A O M and he spell out diamonds.

31:32.540 --> 31:33.580
It's kind of dumb.

31:33.580 --> 31:37.740
That sounds like racial profiling to me a little bit.

31:37.740 --> 31:41.580
It's stereotyping a lot, but especially when you start getting into like the Cowboys and

31:41.580 --> 31:42.800
the hippies and all that stuff.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.420
But anyway, it gets impossibly hard though when words just disappear from the red cards

31:48.420 --> 31:54.340
and now it'll be like, it'll like the red card will be rock and question, question,

31:54.340 --> 31:55.420
question, question.

31:55.420 --> 32:00.060
And so you have to look on the board and be able to find role and know that it goes with

32:00.060 --> 32:01.060
rock.

32:01.060 --> 32:04.160
And not only that, you have to figure out which one of the three cards it's, it's as

32:04.160 --> 32:07.520
impossible to figure out how to play as it is to figure out how I'm explaining it to

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
you to be honest.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.580
So single player gets weird fast.

32:11.580 --> 32:16.560
So I honestly think apples to apples is only going to be fun if you have people to play

32:16.560 --> 32:17.560
it with.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.560
And how much was it again?

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
10 bucks.

32:19.560 --> 32:24.240
And honestly, for that price, you should go to target and actually buy apples to apples.

32:24.240 --> 32:28.960
I mean, really, you'll have more fun with real people than you will, I think online.

32:28.960 --> 32:34.840
Sorry to say, but, um, you know, for, I guess a card game going to a flash game from a technical

32:34.840 --> 32:37.720
perspective would be, it integrates with Facebook.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.920
If you want to spam your achievements for everybody, I don't see every Xbox game doing

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
that.

32:42.920 --> 32:43.920
So I guess some people are into that.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
All right.

32:44.920 --> 32:50.660
Uh, since you brought up games that are party games that have been translated to the Xbox,

32:50.660 --> 32:54.200
here's a challenge for any developers out there that I think this would be perfect.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.240
For an indie game, because the sure as hell aren't going to bring the Xbox live arcade

32:58.240 --> 32:59.240
eat poop.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
You cat.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.240
Oh yeah.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.240
Yeah.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.000
You've talked about this on the show before, but for those, for those who don't know what

33:04.000 --> 33:08.640
game you're talking about, it's basically like a visual telephone.

33:08.640 --> 33:13.920
You start off by writing a phrase, you know, it could be like, I like apples.

33:13.920 --> 33:18.840
And then the next person draws what draws a picture of the phrase.

33:18.840 --> 33:23.080
And then, uh, the person after that, the first phrase is hidden.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.280
So all they see is the picture and they have to come up with a new caption for it.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.000
And it goes on from there until, especially when you get people that can't draw at all

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
like me.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.840
Yeah, it goes on from there.

33:32.840 --> 33:38.040
But I think that'd be hilarious to do like a, you know, a game like that.

33:38.040 --> 33:42.320
Maybe have Xbox live support or something like that.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.440
Alpha Kana gram in our chat room is going so far as to correct me and even saying, but

33:46.440 --> 33:49.740
sky it's $20 is target at target.

33:49.740 --> 33:50.740
It's double.

33:50.740 --> 33:51.840
Well, well hold on.

33:51.840 --> 33:56.360
Alpha Kana gram, I'm going to one up you because if you want to play with your friend on Xbox,

33:56.360 --> 33:58.400
you both have to buy the game.

33:58.400 --> 34:04.800
So that's $10 each ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.780
And more if you have more friends, right?

34:06.780 --> 34:11.160
So anyhow, I love that somebody actually went to look that up.

34:11.160 --> 34:14.040
I'm going to hope he just bought that as a Christmas present for somebody recently or

34:14.040 --> 34:16.840
whatever it is he celebrates this time of year.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.840
All right.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.080
Um, anyhow, uh, so there was that other games I played this week, Mario Kart seven on the

34:21.080 --> 34:26.360
three D S um, I'm going to say the exact same thing every other reviewer has said about

34:26.360 --> 34:27.360
Mario Kart seven.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.480
You ready?

34:28.480 --> 34:31.800
It's Mario Kart.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.760
That's really an accurate description.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.840
I mean, you, you know, Mario Kart, anybody who's been playing games for a while knows

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
Mario Kart.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.840
It's the same game that was on the DS and the it's on every Nintendo system and it's

34:42.840 --> 34:45.980
on now on the three D S the three D is tasteful.

34:45.980 --> 34:47.160
It's not over the top.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.000
Uh, it's, it's done fine.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.560
It's, it's fun to play with three D.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.680
The online works just like the Wii.

34:52.680 --> 34:56.700
This almost essentially feels like a port of the Wii game to the three D S but with

34:56.700 --> 34:58.240
some newer tracks.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.120
I don't understand some of the online stuff they integrated.

35:01.120 --> 35:06.260
Like my three D S will randomly get these randoms, um, ghosts just seem to download

35:06.260 --> 35:07.260
from online.

35:07.260 --> 35:08.260
Randomly random ghosts.

35:08.260 --> 35:09.260
Yes.

35:09.260 --> 35:10.260
Randomly random.

35:10.260 --> 35:11.260
It's super random.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.400
It's more, it's redundantly redundant.

35:12.400 --> 35:16.620
And it'll be like, you just got a new ghost and I'll be like, Oh, maybe I street passed

35:16.620 --> 35:20.320
with somebody or maybe somebody on my friends list just, you know, somehow sent me a ghost

35:20.320 --> 35:21.520
from through the internet.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
How cool.

35:22.520 --> 35:28.000
And then I'll, I'll race against the ghost and it'll be like, you beat Kanji cut text

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
from Japan.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.400
And I'm like, I don't know this person.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.180
Why did it send me this ghost?

35:32.180 --> 35:36.640
So you get like random stuff, but you can do community stuff in Mario Kart.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.800
I'm going to name my first born Kanji text from Japan.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.800
Shut up.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.480
Um, uh, you can do community stuff.

35:43.480 --> 35:48.000
So of course, as we do for any new community thing that hits the internet, we have run

35:48.000 --> 35:50.360
and hurriedly set up the OL army community.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.440
I have no idea how community racing works for, from what I understand, there's like

35:53.440 --> 35:56.140
a top three for the month and you can do all that.

35:56.140 --> 36:01.160
So the friend code is posted on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or sorry, community code.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.280
It's different than a friend code.

36:02.280 --> 36:08.000
The community code for the oil army is posted on Twitter and it's on our Facebooks as well.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.480
Um, and I'm sure somebody will post it in chat in a matter of minutes at us because

36:12.480 --> 36:15.800
live during the break tonight, I'm going to try and play it.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.560
Now I understand it might be an entire grand prix race, so I might have to drop, but I'll

36:19.560 --> 36:22.360
do at least a couple of races with you guys during the mid point break tonight.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.240
I am planning on getting this game and actually I'm also planning, not even planning.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.680
I am getting super Mario three land.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.040
I will have it Friday.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.400
Uh, tiger call on our chat says it's spot pass.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.440
Yeah, I know it's spot pass, but it makes no sense.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.440
Like I get spot passes.

36:38.440 --> 36:42.560
Some of the other games I play like, uh, super Mario three, I know what it is.

36:42.560 --> 36:47.280
It's all those Japanese developers that you, uh, street passed within.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.200
Didn't you like do some at E3?

36:49.200 --> 36:53.880
Do you think because I've exchanged data with them before, like at E3, now I'm getting all

36:53.880 --> 36:54.880
their ghosts.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.880
Really?

36:55.880 --> 36:56.880
Yeah.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.280
So I'm playing against Japanese developers and I'm kicking their ass.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.280
Yeah.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.280
Yeah, I think so.

37:01.280 --> 37:05.880
I think if you cross reference those ghosts with, you know, really, yeah, cause that would

37:05.880 --> 37:08.880
be a, that makes a lot of sense actually.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.480
That's kind of weird.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.880
Interesting.

37:11.880 --> 37:15.160
I know somebody who got me a moto's me at E3.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.160
No, no, no, no.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.160
Hold on.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.160
I'm sorry.

37:18.160 --> 37:23.080
It's just the door is wide open for the jokes.

37:23.080 --> 37:28.680
You might be easy to be because they are of a certain nationality and they're not, they're,

37:28.680 --> 37:36.600
they're not typically good drivers.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
Racism fail.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
All right.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.080
That's racism racing right there.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.400
Stop.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.760
All right.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.760
But I will say this.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.320
The other thing I got to say about Mario Kart seven is that a lot of really good retro tracks

37:51.320 --> 37:52.320
came back.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.600
Like a Waluigi pinball.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.880
That track is so fun.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.320
And some of the Wii tracks came back that are awesome too.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.320
Here's my gripe.

37:58.320 --> 38:03.160
And this has been since like, I think even the NDS one.

38:03.160 --> 38:08.720
What's up with them bringing back the most terrible tracks for battle mode.

38:08.720 --> 38:14.120
Like their, their decision, Hey, from the test before let's bring back the big donut

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
or something like that.

38:15.120 --> 38:19.340
Like one of the, like the most, you know, kind of terrible.

38:19.340 --> 38:23.160
Like they brought back Mario circuit two from the original super Nintendo game.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.800
And like if I was going to bring back one of the courses in the super Nintendo game,

38:25.800 --> 38:29.200
I would have brought back one of the ghost houses because those levels were epic.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.160
I think they did that in the DS one though.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.160
I know.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.640
I mean, they pick, they pick these really random tracks that they bring back.

38:35.640 --> 38:39.960
It's like, and you didn't want to bring back block four or you didn't want to bring back,

38:39.960 --> 38:43.880
you know, um, I don't remember the one that they had that where's another one.

38:43.880 --> 38:48.640
It was like a four tiered one that was on or three tiered one on the Nintendo 64 version.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.720
That was pretty awesome, but Oh, those, you know, those are terrible.

38:52.720 --> 38:57.320
We'll just bring back the donut or all the weird ones that they had in the Wii there

38:57.320 --> 38:59.160
just made no sense.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.800
All right.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.160
Um, so that's Mario Kart seven.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.960
It's Mario Kart, but it's like, look, if you have a three DS already, you probably have

39:07.960 --> 39:09.560
already bought Mario Kart seven.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.280
I don't know what else I can tell you.

39:11.280 --> 39:15.920
If you've never played a Mario Kart game before, then go to a friend's house who has it and

39:15.920 --> 39:16.920
use download play.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.600
Cause you can do download play with one cart and there you go.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.600
Instant demo.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
All right.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
One more.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
You should have brought your system.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.600
All right.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.600
One more game.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
I street pass with people at Umlaut too.

39:26.600 --> 39:32.800
They have new houses in Mario three D land, toad houses and stuff, so anyway, one more

39:32.800 --> 39:35.400
game to talk about this week, one more Unimas.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.640
And it's a game that Loki loaned to me two weeks ago that I finally got around to playing

39:38.640 --> 39:39.640
this week.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
Yes.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.440
I jumped in and I played saints row, the third, which is totally not the type of game I would

39:44.440 --> 39:48.640
ever imagine myself playing because like, I get why people like grand theft auto, but

39:48.640 --> 39:54.000
I'm always like, eh, you know what I'd rather play a role playing game or something, but

39:54.000 --> 39:57.560
I decided to approach saints row three with an open mind and I got our saints row, the

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
third season with an open mind.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.880
And I got to tell you, well, I should say this.

40:00.880 --> 40:04.840
I played the first game in the series or I played like a extended demo or some, I played

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
it at friend's house or something else.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.960
Kind of like, Oh, okay.

40:06.960 --> 40:07.960
It's grand theft auto.

40:07.960 --> 40:08.960
Huh?

40:08.960 --> 40:12.240
So when this new one comes out, I'm like, Oh, and look, he's telling me, no, really.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.680
It's it's like way over the top and it's crazy.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.680
Now it's so fun.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.680
Like it's not like the first game.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
It's kind of like, Oh sure.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
Lucky.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
Sure.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
You just, you just like this game.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
That's cool.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.680
That's cool.

40:21.680 --> 40:26.560
And I have not laughed, I have not laughed this hard at a video game in a very long time.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.620
It is so funny.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.600
And it's funny because it's stupid as hell.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.840
But in that getting together to watch a movie with your friends, that's really bad.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.640
Like a Manos, the hands of fate, mystery science theater kind of way.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.560
Like it was awful, great.

40:43.560 --> 40:50.940
And I got to say just, I am actually really impressed at how well they integrate the whole

40:50.940 --> 40:54.320
create your own character and get it into the experience.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.220
Because like, you know, towards the beginning of the game, you're allowed to create whatever

40:57.220 --> 40:58.640
kind of character you want.

40:58.640 --> 41:05.860
You can create a boy, girl, big boobies, little boobies, you know, fat, skinny.

41:05.860 --> 41:10.480
Although I would argue that their version of fat is not that fat, but whatever.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.100
And you know, you can do whatever you can have your character run around naked for all

41:14.100 --> 41:15.100
you care.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.960
You know, you could, you can design your character.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.840
It's a great creator.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
And then you get to pick a voice.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
Do you want a man voice?

41:20.840 --> 41:21.840
Do you want a woman voice?

41:21.840 --> 41:23.560
Or do you want to be a zombie?

41:23.560 --> 41:28.860
And no matter what it is you pick, you're like fully integrated into the game as the

41:28.860 --> 41:31.040
leader of this gang.

41:31.040 --> 41:37.960
So I decided to make my character, I made kind of like, like a Pam Greer from a Blackspoitation

41:37.960 --> 41:43.600
film in the 70s, if she had gigantic, well, she did have gigantic titties, but like unrealistically

41:43.600 --> 41:48.540
big titties, because I took the tip meter as high as it would go.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.040
And she's large and in charge.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.960
And at first I was going to make her a grandma, but I decided, no, I'm going to scale back

41:53.960 --> 41:55.080
the age a little bit.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.240
So she's kind of like, she's like a husky kind of Pam Greer.

41:58.240 --> 42:03.680
And it's like, what I love about it is that it flows so well with the, with the woman

42:03.680 --> 42:09.200
voice and everything, like, like the way, I know what you guys are thinking, like, what

42:09.200 --> 42:10.200
are you saying?

42:10.200 --> 42:11.200
A woman can't be in charge or whatever.

42:11.200 --> 42:16.580
But no, what I'm saying is that it's almost like they've recorded everything seven or

42:16.580 --> 42:23.040
eight times or however many characters there are to get the script to work impressive,

42:23.040 --> 42:30.280
that attention to detail on something so stupid, but it pays off tremendously.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.680
That attention to detail pays off tremendously.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.960
I was laughing so fucking hard.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.600
I was crying during that airplane sequence where my character gets sucked out the door.

42:39.600 --> 42:44.760
So her fat ass is rolling down the little shoot and then they're skydiving or whatever.

42:44.760 --> 42:48.520
And there's this whole like skydiving sequence and you're, you're literally flipping upside

42:48.520 --> 42:51.340
down to shoot people mid-air as you're skydiving.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.960
And then you're flipping right side up.

42:52.960 --> 42:56.200
And then like, you're going, are we about to fly through that plane window?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.400
And you know, there's only one way we can do this.

42:58.400 --> 43:04.080
And so you, you throw the chick off your back and she yells ASSHOLE as you throw her.

43:04.080 --> 43:08.980
And just my character stays sassy the entire time, which is so true to the character I

43:08.980 --> 43:12.740
wanted her to be.

43:12.740 --> 43:17.760
Or you got to remember, to put this in perspective, last week or the week before I was talking

43:17.760 --> 43:23.000
about White Knight Chronicles 2 on the PlayStation 3, where you also create a character, but

43:23.000 --> 43:24.620
your character never talks.

43:24.620 --> 43:26.380
Your character is a bystander.

43:26.380 --> 43:29.080
Your character isn't integrated into the story at all.

43:29.080 --> 43:33.280
I'm not saying this makes White Knight Chronicles a bad game, but when you put that side by

43:33.280 --> 43:38.080
side with the lengths that they've gone to integrate whatever it is you want into Saints

43:38.080 --> 43:42.740
Row the Third, I am like so impressed with that level of detail.

43:42.740 --> 43:48.180
And just, just the fact that my character can get into a tank and blow shit up and,

43:48.180 --> 43:51.420
and as Bobby was talking about in his show before when he was talking about the game,

43:51.420 --> 43:55.900
and I noticed this too, I was so damn impressed with that sequence where you get in the car

43:55.900 --> 44:01.260
and you're listening to the radio and Sublime's What I Got comes on the radio and you and

44:01.260 --> 44:05.240
your, your gang member that you're driving with starts singing along to the song like

44:05.240 --> 44:10.940
loving is what I got and they're, they're singing it the way people in that role would

44:10.940 --> 44:11.940
really sing it.

44:11.940 --> 44:16.340
You know, it's like there's a line in the song that goes like, but I can still get high

44:16.340 --> 44:23.480
and like my character shouts like, you know, it like it's, it's little things like that

44:23.480 --> 44:28.380
that just put this game in a caliber where it's like, you really like, I think you have

44:28.380 --> 44:29.580
to experience it.

44:29.580 --> 44:32.220
Like I Loki, you're right.

44:32.220 --> 44:34.860
It's game is hilarious and it's fun to play.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.060
But it's, I'm going to have to play it and only gets better.

44:38.060 --> 44:42.740
It's just, it's like you think that the whole airplane thing was ridiculous.

44:42.740 --> 44:43.740
Let me put it this way.

44:43.740 --> 44:47.020
Have you seen the new, the new 18 movie?

44:47.020 --> 44:48.940
You had no, I haven't seen the new 18 movie.

44:48.940 --> 44:49.940
Okay.

44:49.940 --> 44:51.660
Well there's, let me put it this way.

44:51.660 --> 44:57.020
The first skydive sequence reminded me a lot of shoot them up the Clive Owen movie.

44:57.020 --> 45:02.940
This their spoiler, there is a second skydive sequence at one point that reminds me a lot

45:02.940 --> 45:08.540
of the a team where they try to fly a tank.

45:08.540 --> 45:09.540
I can't, I can't stress.

45:09.540 --> 45:13.260
And then, no, somebody in the chat room asked, Rama Rama asked if I gave my character an

45:13.260 --> 45:14.260
Afro.

45:14.260 --> 45:15.260
No, I did.

45:15.260 --> 45:18.940
I, I gave, I gave her the long flowing hot black hair to go, you know, she's got the

45:18.940 --> 45:23.380
volume of the Beyonce luminous, no, she has voluminous hair, kind of a modern, modern

45:23.380 --> 45:25.940
day Jackie Brown, Pam Greer looking thing.

45:25.940 --> 45:30.740
But um, just my character is so sassy and that's what I wanted her to be.

45:30.740 --> 45:32.580
And it's great.

45:32.580 --> 45:36.060
I did, I did play some more Saints Row the Third this week.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.060
I forgot.

45:37.060 --> 45:41.480
I, we've been playing horde mode during our lunch breaks and that game, horde mode is

45:41.480 --> 45:43.900
pretty fun on its own actually.

45:43.900 --> 45:44.900
It's just really ridiculous.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.460
Some of the stuff that they have.

45:46.460 --> 45:49.100
Now what cracks me up, Dark Sakura, when you play through the game, what you should do

45:49.100 --> 45:54.340
is you should make a zombie because apparently if you play as a zombie, that is still integrated

45:54.340 --> 45:55.660
in the story mode.

45:55.660 --> 46:03.220
So like, you know, your characters will be talking, your characters like seriously what

46:03.220 --> 46:04.220
they do.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.220
Yeah.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.220
What you said.

46:06.220 --> 46:09.700
So you really think we should do that?

46:09.700 --> 46:11.860
I don't want to play a zombie.

46:11.860 --> 46:16.820
If I play it, I want to make a, you know, my type of character and the zombie will sing

46:16.820 --> 46:20.220
what I got as well.

46:20.220 --> 46:23.820
Travis Donovan over at under station live made me, he's been playing through the game

46:23.820 --> 46:26.100
as me and apparently I like to run around.

46:26.100 --> 46:29.740
I apparently I do this in real life with hot pink bunny slippers and a hello kitty backpack

46:29.740 --> 46:35.240
because that's what the me character in the game has, but I imagine the game is hilarious

46:35.240 --> 46:41.300
still because you're playing this guy and you know, probably still really funny with

46:41.300 --> 46:42.300
all the outfits.

46:42.300 --> 46:47.820
So just don't expect like you got to put a game like Saints Row the Third side by side

46:47.820 --> 46:54.860
with Skyrim and they couldn't, they're so different, but they're both like open world

46:54.860 --> 46:56.020
games and so forth.

46:56.020 --> 47:01.280
And I think, I think it's just one of those things where it's like, like Skyrim is the

47:01.280 --> 47:06.900
Oscar nominated picture you see at the art house movie, which is a great experience and

47:06.900 --> 47:09.700
you'll just, you'll be, you know, happy to have witnessed it.

47:09.700 --> 47:15.220
And then it's basically, it's Laura, the rings and fucking transformers.

47:15.220 --> 47:19.100
I mean, or no, it's like except transformers wasn't actually saints row.

47:19.100 --> 47:25.340
The third is like getting high and going to see, um, pink Floyd's the wall set to the

47:25.340 --> 47:26.340
lasers.

47:26.340 --> 47:27.340
No.

47:27.340 --> 47:30.740
Would it be the difference between watching Lord of the rings and Friday?

47:30.740 --> 47:31.740
Yes.

47:31.740 --> 47:33.740
That's a great analogy.

47:33.740 --> 47:36.780
Friday is also an amazing movie, right?

47:36.780 --> 47:39.140
It's hilarious, but not for the same reasons.

47:39.140 --> 47:41.780
Friday is just fucking funny, right?

47:41.780 --> 47:42.780
That's a great analogy.

47:42.780 --> 47:45.260
I would compare it to like Lord of the rings in the movie.

47:45.260 --> 47:50.860
Shoot them up, shoot them up is seriously like this game follows that movie.

47:50.860 --> 47:55.860
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that they took straight out of just ridiculous actions sequences.

47:55.860 --> 48:00.820
Um, like the whole, whole intro is seriously ripped off of that movie, but I don't care

48:00.820 --> 48:01.820
cause it's awesome.

48:01.820 --> 48:04.340
All right, let's go to one question from the chat room and then we'll, we got to get to

48:04.340 --> 48:05.460
gaming news.

48:05.460 --> 48:07.860
It's been like an hour and we're still talking about our gaming weeks.

48:07.860 --> 48:11.300
Tiger class says, makes you wonder if they were ever to make a saints row movie, would

48:11.300 --> 48:12.780
it be an action comedy?

48:12.780 --> 48:17.220
Okay, look, whoever does the saints row movie, which I am all for at this point, like I think

48:17.220 --> 48:21.820
I absolutely think they should make a saints row movie and I think it should be over the

48:21.820 --> 48:23.660
top stupid funny.

48:23.660 --> 48:25.180
Like it needs to be like airplane.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.180
Okay.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.820
So I think the Zucker brothers should do the saints row movie.

48:28.820 --> 48:32.100
I need to just incorporate Leslie Nielsen in there somewhere.

48:32.100 --> 48:33.100
He's dead.

48:33.100 --> 48:36.100
I know, but I mean, it doesn't matter.

48:36.100 --> 48:37.100
It doesn't matter.

48:37.100 --> 48:41.240
They could, you know, work him in cause it would have to have through technology these

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
days.

48:42.240 --> 48:43.240
Exactly.

48:43.240 --> 48:48.380
Well they could, if they could do, you know, what was that last, um, Bruce Lee movie where

48:48.380 --> 48:52.140
he's, you know, dead halfway through filming it.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.140
I love it.

48:53.140 --> 48:59.380
See her in our chat room says, I thought you guys were talking about the song Friday.

48:59.380 --> 49:03.100
Still an accurate comparison.

49:03.100 --> 49:04.780
Lord of the rings.

49:04.780 --> 49:08.100
Rebecca blacks Friday was 17 gazillion YouTube views.

49:08.100 --> 49:09.100
All right, look.

49:09.100 --> 49:14.580
So that was my gaming week saints row, the third hilariously stupid, hilarious.

49:14.580 --> 49:15.580
All right.

49:15.580 --> 49:19.020
And I will play more of it because I just, I laugh consistently when I'm playing that

49:19.020 --> 49:20.020
game.

49:20.020 --> 49:21.020
And I think that's so important.

49:21.020 --> 49:23.540
So, all right.

49:23.540 --> 49:24.880
Sometimes you want final fantasy.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.780
Sometimes you want Dick and fart jokes.

49:26.780 --> 49:28.060
All right.

49:28.060 --> 49:31.060
Housekeeping twitter.com slash O L R.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.260
Visit us on Twitter, uh, facebook.com slash orange.

49:34.260 --> 49:35.260
I'll show you.

49:35.260 --> 49:37.480
We are on Facebook upcoming show schedule.

49:37.480 --> 49:39.720
We will be here next week on the 18th.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.660
We will not be here on the 25th.

49:41.660 --> 49:46.580
Although some alternative thing might go on on the 25th, like online or something.

49:46.580 --> 49:47.580
I don't know.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.780
Um, we got a milkshake.

49:49.780 --> 49:50.780
Where's mine.

49:50.780 --> 49:51.780
All right.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.780
Just kidding.

49:52.780 --> 49:54.940
I, anyway, uh, I had Starbucks on the way here.

49:54.940 --> 49:58.580
If you can't tell, I'm wired on coffee today on the first.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.660
We should have a show as of right now.

50:00.660 --> 50:02.140
It looks like we will have a show on the first.

50:02.140 --> 50:06.200
I don't know if anybody who doesn't camp or whatever be here on the first.

50:06.200 --> 50:10.600
So I think we're doing a show then, which is the exact opposite of Bobby who comes on

50:10.600 --> 50:11.600
before us.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.080
Bobby's going to do a show Christmas night.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.260
So spend, spend your Christmas with Bobby here on all games radio and then spend your

50:16.260 --> 50:17.260
new years with us.

50:17.260 --> 50:19.260
We'll ring in 2012.

50:19.260 --> 50:20.260
Okay.

50:20.260 --> 50:26.020
Um, let's get into the gaming news, but surprisingly enough for this time of year when everybody's

50:26.020 --> 50:29.380
getting ready to go on holiday breaks and everything, there's a lot of damn gaming news

50:29.380 --> 50:30.380
going on.

50:30.380 --> 50:31.380
Right?

50:31.380 --> 50:32.380
Loki start us off.

50:32.380 --> 50:33.380
Yeah.

50:33.380 --> 50:36.180
We're going to be talking about this, uh, the spike video game award show.

50:36.180 --> 50:40.220
And of course with the VGA's, there's a lot of, um, do you watch the VGA's?

50:40.220 --> 50:41.220
Nope.

50:41.220 --> 50:42.220
No.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.220
Me neither.

50:43.220 --> 50:44.220
Nope.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.220
I just, I don't even have to ask Jamie.

50:45.220 --> 50:46.220
I'll just watch the trailers afterwards.

50:46.220 --> 50:47.220
Why am I going to waste?

50:47.220 --> 50:48.220
Thank you.

50:48.220 --> 50:49.220
Tiger call.

50:49.220 --> 50:50.220
It was game of death.

50:50.220 --> 50:52.740
Everything I've heard about the VGA's online was that they just like people felt their

50:52.740 --> 50:57.020
IQs dropping rapidly as they were watching it as if anybody should be surprised.

50:57.020 --> 50:58.020
It's spike.

50:58.020 --> 51:02.940
No offense, but I mean they have game trailers, TV and game trailers did a lot of the, um,

51:02.940 --> 51:08.740
you know, while they did all the trailer stuff, they have it hosted on their site, but it's

51:08.740 --> 51:13.300
just like watching GTTV, you know, because it's really late and obviously I don't watch

51:13.300 --> 51:16.860
it then, but I'll just catch it, you know, when the trailers come online the next day

51:16.860 --> 51:20.060
and that's kind of what happened, um, for the most part.

51:20.060 --> 51:26.100
Um, so one of the, of course announced, they tease and they announced a lot of games, um,

51:26.100 --> 51:27.100
during the show.

51:27.100 --> 51:31.580
So one of the games of course that's been in, you know, talked about for a while, Metal

51:31.580 --> 51:32.580
Gear Solid Rising.

51:32.580 --> 51:39.220
Well, now apparently Metal Gear Solid Rising is now Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance,

51:39.220 --> 51:45.820
which almost sounds like a made up word, but I'm, it's, subtitles are cool.

51:45.820 --> 51:47.880
It's vengeance, but revenge.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.880
It's called a portmanteau.

51:49.880 --> 51:55.280
Um, it's a combination of two words, duh.

51:55.280 --> 51:59.540
Really why I think the reason they have to add the subtitle in the first place is because

51:59.540 --> 52:02.860
it's gonna be a series, would be my guess.

52:02.860 --> 52:09.300
But yeah, it's now actually being worked on by Platinum Games, of course the company responsible

52:09.300 --> 52:18.300
for such wonderful things like Bayonetta or, um, Madworld or, um, oh what was the other

52:18.300 --> 52:19.300
one?

52:19.300 --> 52:22.940
Which, funny enough, coming off the Saints Row 3rd discussion is kind of in that same

52:22.940 --> 52:27.740
bucket, where Bayonetta, again, sometimes you just want a big, stupid action movie,

52:27.740 --> 52:30.420
and don't get me wrong, Bayonetta is great.

52:30.420 --> 52:34.740
Bayonetta would make an awesome movie, and they have to.

52:34.740 --> 52:39.340
If a Bayonetta movie ever happens, Joe Pesci better fucking be in that movie, because if

52:39.340 --> 52:40.820
there's no Joe Pesci there.

52:40.820 --> 52:41.820
He's almost too old.

52:41.820 --> 52:42.820
They gotta hurry.

52:42.820 --> 52:43.820
No, no, no.

52:43.820 --> 52:44.820
He can do it.

52:44.820 --> 52:45.820
No, they need Mark Shephard.

52:45.820 --> 52:46.820
Who?

52:46.820 --> 52:47.820
Mark Shephard.

52:47.820 --> 52:49.140
Who's he?

52:49.140 --> 52:50.140
You don't want Supernatural.

52:50.140 --> 52:51.140
He plays Crowley.

52:51.140 --> 52:52.140
Of course I don't.

52:52.140 --> 52:53.140
He plays Crowley.

52:53.140 --> 52:54.140
I'm a 30 year old male.

52:54.140 --> 52:57.580
There's nothing in Supernatural for me.

52:57.580 --> 52:59.820
He's just, he's just, he would be perfect for that row.

52:59.820 --> 53:00.820
That role.

53:00.820 --> 53:01.820
Fair enough.

53:01.820 --> 53:04.340
Except Joe Pesci is that role.

53:04.340 --> 53:08.020
Yeah, when I played the game, I thought Joe Pesci did, but if Joe Pesci was too old, then

53:08.020 --> 53:10.380
I guess whoever Dark Tiger is talking about.

53:10.380 --> 53:12.140
So but that'd be, that'd be awesome.

53:12.140 --> 53:17.260
But anyways, yeah, it's not a lot of details are released about this yet, other than the

53:17.260 --> 53:21.380
fact that, you know, New Studio is working on it now, and also it's supposed to take

53:21.380 --> 53:27.460
place now in the time period after Metal Gear Solid 4, and I guess you're gonna be doing

53:27.460 --> 53:30.420
like, mercenary work for different people and stuff.

53:30.420 --> 53:35.020
I heard, um, it's getting a lot of flack from the Metal Gear community because it's not

53:35.020 --> 53:38.680
a true quote unquote, Metal Gear game.

53:38.680 --> 53:43.980
But I'm kind of like, well, I mean, they've done a lot of spinoff Metal Gear games.

53:43.980 --> 53:48.760
And in my opinion, you know, I, I was kind of like, okay, whatever about this game.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.820
But now that I hear that the Bayonetta folks are involved, I've perked up a little bit.

53:51.820 --> 53:55.900
And I'm like, oh, they're serious about making an action Metal Gear game at this point.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.140
Because, you know, Bayonetta was a heck of a game.

53:58.140 --> 54:02.900
So I'm, I'm kind of interested in this, like way more than I was before, which is only

54:02.900 --> 54:03.980
a little bit.

54:03.980 --> 54:06.160
So you know, these things are going to happen.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.580
Are you going to be completely denied a Metal Gear Solid 5 because of this game?

54:09.580 --> 54:10.900
I don't think so.

54:10.900 --> 54:11.900
It'll happen eventually.

54:11.900 --> 54:12.900
Yeah.

54:12.900 --> 54:18.780
So, um, yeah, I mean, come on, Kojima has even said that, you know, that they're going

54:18.780 --> 54:22.380
to be doing a five.

54:22.380 --> 54:24.220
He knows that people want a five.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.660
Jack Deft in our chat room says, simply screw the fans.

54:26.660 --> 54:27.660
Rising looks awesome.

54:27.660 --> 54:28.860
I kind of agree.

54:28.860 --> 54:29.860
Yeah.

54:29.860 --> 54:33.180
If the fans of Metal Gear, whatever don't want it, then don't buy it.

54:33.180 --> 54:34.180
More for me.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.180
All right.

54:35.180 --> 54:39.720
Well, we were talking about the new Xbox live dashboard that rolled out this week and you

54:39.720 --> 54:44.460
might have not noticed this, but, uh, thankfully the internet was there to help you out.

54:44.460 --> 54:51.560
Uh, the terms of service for Xbox have recently updated where now you will not be able to

54:51.560 --> 54:55.420
essentially sue Microsoft as part of a class action agreement anymore.

54:55.420 --> 54:59.180
You might remember this conversation from a few months ago when Sony did the same thing

54:59.180 --> 55:03.100
in their terms of service, except there's kind of a difference in that is that, you

55:03.100 --> 55:08.260
know, Sony had that whole hack thing that went on a while ago and like actually had

55:08.260 --> 55:12.340
a reason that people might want to file a class action lawsuit, but Microsoft to our

55:12.340 --> 55:15.180
knowledge hasn't had anything happen.

55:15.180 --> 55:20.500
But then there's that part of me that goes, well, you know, people are getting, including

55:20.500 --> 55:25.060
yours truly are getting their Xbox is hacked yet Microsoft keeps denying that something's

55:25.060 --> 55:26.240
going on.

55:26.240 --> 55:31.060
Are they getting us to all accept this agreement here so that in 45 days, uh, they're going

55:31.060 --> 55:34.820
to announce it, you know, there was some type of breach or come be a little more forthright.

55:34.820 --> 55:35.820
Well, what's going on?

55:35.820 --> 55:39.180
Why everybody I know is getting their Xbox hacked that hasn't changed their password

55:39.180 --> 55:40.740
recently.

55:40.740 --> 55:41.740
So I don't know.

55:41.740 --> 55:47.540
I mean, would you really like go to a court and actually start a lawsuit against them,

55:47.540 --> 55:54.140
uh, or, well, I mean, I think if you're going to start a lawsuit against Microsoft, just

55:54.140 --> 55:55.140
do it on your own.

55:55.140 --> 56:00.700
I mean, I understand class action lawsuits are just so you, I think it's, it's a lot

56:00.700 --> 56:04.020
of the class action lawsuits are started by these lawyers that just want to make some

56:04.020 --> 56:09.100
money and you know, they just send out a blanket, noticed everybody and they're like, Hey, money's

56:09.100 --> 56:10.100
coming your way.

56:10.100 --> 56:14.020
And you're like, whoa, I don't have to do shit, you know, and I get free money.

56:14.020 --> 56:16.540
I mean, I think that's what happened with like grand theft.

56:16.540 --> 56:20.060
I don't even know if I ever got a check for grand theft auto.

56:20.060 --> 56:25.300
I don't really care cause I still had grand theft auto and um, I wasn't gonna, you know,

56:25.300 --> 56:29.620
San Andreas, the first issue with the hot coffee stuff in there, it's a cartridge as

56:29.620 --> 56:30.620
I am now.

56:30.620 --> 56:36.500
Um, I mean, I don't know, it's just kinda, it's kind of stupid.

56:36.500 --> 56:42.540
It's like, yeah, I can get mad about it and stuff, but if, if it really was so bad to

56:42.540 --> 56:47.380
where like I wanted to file a lawsuit, I would think that I would just do it on my own.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.860
I mean, and just go through the whole arbitration thing.

56:49.860 --> 56:53.140
And I kind of feel like a company, you know, should not be able to take that right away

56:53.140 --> 56:54.460
from you.

56:54.460 --> 56:57.140
If you really feel like you've been wronged, you should have the right to take them to

56:57.140 --> 56:58.140
a legal court.

56:58.140 --> 56:59.620
Like, isn't that granted in the constitution?

56:59.620 --> 57:04.540
If you have a excuse or if you have a settlement that's more than $20 in value, you have a

57:04.540 --> 57:06.300
right to a trial by jury or something like that.

57:06.300 --> 57:12.660
I think that they're actually, um, they're going to be doing some sort of, I want to

57:12.660 --> 57:16.940
say there has been some court cases or whatever, or places in the United States have found

57:16.940 --> 57:21.700
that those arbitration things can't be upheld in court or something.

57:21.700 --> 57:22.900
It's kind of like on both sides.

57:22.900 --> 57:28.620
I think there's been some cases that have gone in the favor of the whole, um, arbitration

57:28.620 --> 57:32.900
clauses and some against it and it's just which one has precedence or not.

57:32.900 --> 57:33.900
All right.

57:33.900 --> 57:36.100
Anyhow, um, I do want to point out, this is important.

57:36.100 --> 57:39.940
You can't opt out of this by the way, if you want to keep using Xbox live, you cannot opt

57:39.940 --> 57:40.940
out of this.

57:40.940 --> 57:43.420
There was some rumor going around at first that it kind of had the postcard thing going

57:43.420 --> 57:49.940
on, but actually what's going on is that you can reject future changes to the arbitration

57:49.940 --> 57:52.580
agreement, but you cannot decline this one.

57:52.580 --> 57:56.840
So if you don't like it, you got to stop using Xbox live and I got to get this out here.

57:56.840 --> 58:01.560
This is the one other big thing I do not like about this is that because I can't opt out

58:01.560 --> 58:06.980
to these changes or what have you, that's kind of shady to me because of the fact that

58:06.980 --> 58:09.680
my Xbox live is already paid for in advance.

58:09.680 --> 58:14.180
So they're making changes to the agreement midway through is kind of, it's just, it's

58:14.180 --> 58:15.180
just shady.

58:15.180 --> 58:17.780
I mean, am I ever going to Sue Microsoft?

58:17.780 --> 58:18.780
Probably not.

58:18.780 --> 58:22.260
You know, it would be nice to know that if I had a reason, I'm sure that they've got

58:22.260 --> 58:27.140
it in the small text or whatever before when you're paying for your, your life that we

58:27.140 --> 58:31.180
can change this at any time, you know, and without notice and blah, blah, blah.

58:31.180 --> 58:34.620
You know, they have their lawyers covering their asses for this shit.

58:34.620 --> 58:37.420
Some, some States are taking action against these things too.

58:37.420 --> 58:41.180
So you know, maybe a matter of time before these types of agreements are illegal anyway.

58:41.180 --> 58:42.180
But I mean, look at it this way.

58:42.180 --> 58:48.900
I mean, honestly, I mean, look at, are any of you really gonna just like go after Microsoft

58:48.900 --> 58:50.480
and actually file a lawsuit?

58:50.480 --> 58:55.260
I think not made for the most case if, if it really, if they do something to you that

58:55.260 --> 58:58.420
really pisses you off, here's how you take care of it later on.

58:58.420 --> 59:00.060
You don't buy their next console.

59:00.060 --> 59:05.340
You just say whatever, if you smear them on the Internet like everyone else does or yes,

59:05.340 --> 59:06.340
mirror them on the Internet.

59:06.340 --> 59:11.740
Well, I'm just like, seriously, if it's, if it's so bad that you actually have to go and

59:11.740 --> 59:17.380
file a lawsuit against, you know, whatever company maybe Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, whoever.

59:17.380 --> 59:21.820
If it's, they're pissing you off that much that you just like, I gotta go file a lawsuit

59:21.820 --> 59:25.220
against them, then just don't buy their product.

59:25.220 --> 59:26.220
That's true.

59:26.220 --> 59:27.220
Kick them where it counts in the wallet.

59:27.220 --> 59:32.140
I mean, cause a lot of people may go that route if there's something like, you know,

59:32.140 --> 59:35.940
if it comes out 45 days later, they're like, oh, you had to sign this arbitration clause

59:35.940 --> 59:40.380
and there's been this massive leak that you've been, you know, covering up.

59:40.380 --> 59:42.060
Trust me, they'll get it in the end.

59:42.060 --> 59:45.260
You know, someone will investigate and say, hey, what the fuck?

59:45.260 --> 59:48.300
You know, why are you having these people sign this?

59:48.300 --> 59:50.740
Oh, because you knew that you were going to get sued.

59:50.740 --> 59:56.900
So I mean, I mean just like, you know, people were worried about buying the 360 back when

59:56.900 --> 59:59.380
the whole red rain, you know, was going around.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.140
By the way, I was at a target the X, you get the other day with a new Xbox, one of the

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.420
newer ones, red ring to e 68, not written, not red dot, excuse me, the red dot of death

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.780
with an e 68 error.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.780
Hilarious.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.260
Problem's still not gone.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.260
Just saying.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.260
Yeah.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.260
All right.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.260
Anyhow.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.480
So, um, there you have it.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.780
Take it or leave it.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:25.020
Get off Xbox live, I guess if you don't like it at this point, but I don't know at the

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.780
end of the day, if I get pissed off enough, that agreement ain't going to stop me.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.780
And I don't think it can.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780
I think that's only about class.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.780
That's a class action waiver.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.820
If me as an individual wants to sue Microsoft, I believe I can still do that.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.520
I don't think anybody can take that right away, but they're just going to make it very

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.740
fucking difficult to do that.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.740
Of course.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.740
They just keep up in the end.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:49.800
You know, it's, it's just a, another case of the big guys, big companies trying to,

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.540
you know, corporations or people.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.500
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.780
Well, um, Epic, we know Epic, don't we?

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:04.980
Well, um, they've announced a game for the Vita, the PS Vita, sorry.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:12.660
Um, and it is a zombie game called Fortnite, F O R T N I T E. And, um, there wasn't actually

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.620
any gameplay shown in the trailer, but it said that it should all the characters picking

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:23.040
up trash and scrap metal and bringing it back and then the zombies show up.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.700
So basically from what I understand is that it's preparing for a zombie assault and then

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.040
the zombies come and you survive the assault.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.900
That would be awesome if it was like junkyard wars meets a zombie apocalypse.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:40.460
Well there's not too much else about it, like, other than, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean Vita,

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:46.060
I just saw Vita add my bad, but it doesn't say exactly, you know, when or what or that

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.620
it's going to be out, but, um, there should be more information soon.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.140
I don't know why, I'm sorry that I said it was on the Vita.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.820
More info in a Fortnite.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:04.940
Um, so there was another teaser trailer, in fact it was one that we were kind of, BioWare

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.900
was doing a new game and everyone was like, oh, it looks like, you know, it's going to

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.020
be a new Command & Conquer game because of all these, you know, website trademarks being

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.580
registered and stuff like that, and yes, it ended up being a new Command & Conquer game.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:22.420
Bye BioWare, can Command & Conquer Generals 2, I almost forgot that there was a Command

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:29.580
& Conquer Generals game, but it's set to come out 2013 on PC exclusively.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:36.300
It's going to be using the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which you may remember from Battlefield 3,

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:42.100
which looked pretty awesome, so, um, very cool to check it out.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.780
I did not play the first Generals game, but I know it was a little bit different than

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.340
the regular Command & Conquer game because I believe it was one where you're actually,

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.540
um, if I remember correctly, you're actually playing as one of the troops kind of on the

01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:01.980
ground and you can still kind of, uh, control different things as well, but it's not just

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.060
like an RTS game, like before, if I remember correctly.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.060
I could be wrong though.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:11.220
There might have been another Command & Conquer game that was also along the lines of that.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:16.380
It's very interesting to me that they are going PC only with this, especially with,

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.840
you know, some developers saying we'll never make PC games again.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.500
I think it's just mainly because Command & Conquer is not very popular on consoles actually.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.100
It's just really more of a PC game.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.660
It's just, it hasn't done well when they've brought the last few to consoles.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.660
Makes sense.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.660
So, unfortunately.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.140
It's like Civilization, maybe, that it doesn't, well, I was going to say it doesn't translate

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:42.000
well to consoles, but I actually think that Civilization Revolution game was pretty good

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.320
for a console game, but it was a scaled-back experience, so it wasn't the same Civilization

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320
you really get on PC.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.020
It would be a good game, I think, if, I mean, RTS-wise, it would be a good game for like

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.020
the Wii U.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.500
I mean, I think RTS games translate well for the Wii U with a, you know, a touch screen

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.780
and you can move stuff around that way.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.180
That'd be kind of cool, because it'd be like playing, uh, what was it, uh, there was a

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:15.660
Tom Clancy's, um, the Tom Clancy game, not End of War, but it was, uh, Rooz, where they

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:20.980
had that actually playable on Microsoft Surface systems, and you could, you know, mess around

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:21.980
with that.

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.540
It'd be kind of similar to playing it on, like, a Surface or something, but you'd be

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.820
playing it with the tablet, if you will.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:32.580
So I could see RTS is coming over there, but, yeah, it's just going to be right now PC only,

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.660
and, you know, if it does well on PC, they may decide to try it again on consoles, but

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.140
as of right now, it's just PC.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.700
And 2013 is when you can expect that.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.180
As a Command & Conquer fan, are you, uh, going to pick this up?

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.700
No, I haven't played Command & Conquer, it's the first Red Alert game.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.340
I mean, that's how long ago it's been.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.700
That is a long time ago.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.700
So.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.700
Alright.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.940
Well, um, going to one more game that was announced at the, um, you know, little thingy

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:04.260
they did last night was, uh, a game called The Last of Us, uh, which is by Naughty Dog.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.420
Those are the folks behind Uncharted and, like, Crash Bandicoot way back in the day.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.140
Um, so this is a game that's coming out, I believe they said it's exclusive for the PlayStation

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:16.060
3, and, uh, in the trailer, it even said that the trailer was, like, a live feed from a

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.020
PlayStation 3, so I guess that's kind of neat.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.900
Um, and it's, I don't know what, like, kind of game they're going for, if it was, like,

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.820
survivable horror or action, I think it's kind of supposed to be, like, a hybrid of

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.820
the two.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.340
But for me, the trailer, and I'm going to play a little bit of the trailer here so at

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.820
least you get some of the audio, the trailer to me looked a little bit, like, kind of like

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.900
a mixture between, what's that Will Smith movie where he's alone in the world after

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.300
the outbreak?

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.300
I am Legend.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300
Thank you.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.900
It looks like I am Legend mixed with, like, a father-daughter bonding thing going on here.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.220
Oh, daddy, you killed him just fine.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.460
Well, she kills one here later on in the trailer, so.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.420
There's kind of one coming up here.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.740
I'm proud of you, babies.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.580
And she looks like the girl from Juno, which is a little weird to me, so, like, is it just

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580
me?

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.180
But you know the premise of this, right?

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:09.380
It's that, um, bacteria, that fungus or whatever that they have, like, in, I think it's in

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:14.460
the rainforest or whatever, that takes over actual, like, insects or whatever and infects

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:20.860
their brain and then they eventually, um, I think die, it, like, controls their body

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.860
almost.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:22.860
Wasn't that the plot to I am Legend?

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.740
No, I am Legend was vampires.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.540
Or was that 28 Days Later?

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.540
28 Days Later was zombies.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.540
Okay.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.740
I'm sorry, it was a disease, but it, you know, it's zombies.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:38.780
Okay, okay, so it's 28 Days Later mixed with I am Legend mixed with, mixed with Juno.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.780
I guess really the best I can tell you.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.780
I guess, oh, the graphics look good.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.860
If that really is real-time rendering or whatever, then it looks really good.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.740
Now, just because it's coming from a PlayStation 3 system, I kind of go, well, it could be

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.020
just a Blu-ray movie.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.460
But if that is, like, really in real-time being developed by the engine, that's, I gotta

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.820
say, a good-looking game.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.660
Uncharted 3 is a pretty sexy-looking game, so I could believe that that's real-time.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.660
Okay, point taken.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.940
So, and this is, by the way, just referencing Bobby's show earlier this evening.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:09.260
This is why he calls the game The Last of Us, because OFIS is all one word looking there.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.260
No, it's not.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:16.460
Yeah, I, yes, I can see that the kerning between the F and the U, speaking of F-U, speaking

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.460
of F-U.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:22.740
You know what, but you did use, you did use the right term.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.860
I can, once in a while, Dark Soccer, this might shock you, once in a while, I have a

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.220
smart moment.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.620
You know what I would have done, though?

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620
What?

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.260
I would have moved the Us, actually, I would have kerned it a little bit differently so

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.460
that the space with the T and the S would have been exactly the same, and that would

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.620
have looked really hot.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.620
Hey, guess what?

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.620
Hire me, people!

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.620
I'm a good designer, really.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.620
Hey, guess what?

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.620
What?

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.620
No one kerr.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.620
All right.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.620
You know what, you know what I would have done differently?

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.460
I would have called it The Happening 2, because that's really kind of what it is.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.380
It's plants taking over people.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.380
Plants versus zombies!

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:59.060
Actually, you know what, The Happening, The Happening, if it was the fungus or whatever

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:06.820
that makes people kill themselves, much like, you know, that fungus that kills ants or whatever,

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:14.060
if it was like that instead of like, oh, it's leaf pollen that makes people murder things,

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.620
that would have been a little bit more realistic.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.420
Wait, I just said more realistic?

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.420
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.780
It's a nice Shyamalan movie, it's not realistic at all.

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:25.860
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says, every game could be better with Tim

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860
Curry in it.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.460
I don't know where that comes from, but yes, that would be absolutely true.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.640
In fact, if Pennywise the Clown was in this game, it would be the scariest video game

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.340
of all time, quite possibly.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340
You know what?

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.500
Didn't we do a list list on this, and it was determined that Pennywise the Clown was like

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.140
the number one character we want to see in a game?

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.420
I didn't know LR Historian stat.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.420
Didn't we determine-

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:50.380
That would guarantee I wouldn't play it, you know.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.540
As much as I love Tim Curry, clowns freak me the fuck out.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.540
That just means he's a good actor.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.540
I mean, think about it.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.540
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.540
Some of the scariest characters-

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.380
Tim Curry, I'm fine with.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.940
Some of the scariest characters from your childhood were Tim Curry.

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.940
Think about it.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:11.460
Pennywise the Clown, Darkness from Legend, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Rooster from Annie.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.660
I mean, he's a great villain.

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.660
Tim Curry does need to be in St. Croix.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.900
But he was also in the Littlest Witch movie, and I'm sorry, not even Tim Curry could save

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.900
that movie.

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.180
It was bad.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.740
I vote, since you know Saints Row, the character can be anyway.

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.660
I vote that he should be the head of the gang in the Saints Row movie.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.660
What, Tim Curry?

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.660
Tim Curry.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.660
Absolutely.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.660
That would be awesome.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.660
That's right.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.260
It would be so random.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.740
As part of the marketing pun, they should never show who the leader of the gang is in

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.100
any of the trailers.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.640
Just leave it up to the movie, and people find out it's Tim Curry.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640
You know what?

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.740
It's like the snazziest suit and everything, except they finally show his feet and its

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.740
nine-inch heels.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.740
All right.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.740
Look.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.740
Moving on.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740
We got another story.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.220
I do want to tease this, though, because we're getting towards the end of part eight, and

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.420
this is important.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.260
If you have Mario Kart 7, get your 3DS out.

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:05.540
Go to twitter.com slash O-L-R, or maybe somebody in chat will yell it out again.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.900
Add us to your community list, because we're going to try.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.620
I don't know how this is going to work, because I haven't played games online, but we're going

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.620
to try during the break.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.780
I'm going to try and do a community race with you guys during tonight's break.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:18.860
So get out your 3DS, get on Mario Kart 7, and add the oil army community so you're ready

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.660
to go in about 20 minutes when we get there.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.660
All right.

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.700
So meantime, Dark Soccer's got some more news for us.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.700
Right, Dark Soccer?

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.700
Yes.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.700
About the Doctor.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.380
There's a Doctor Who game coming out.

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:37.900
BBC let out a leak of the Doctor Who game for PS3, Vita, and PC.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.080
I'm totally going to play the hell out of this.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.580
It's called Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:49.300
And you can basically play as the Doctor and River Song, and they go through the universe

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:54.860
in different time periods, and hopefully there are some Cybermen and Daleks in it, because

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.580
it's not a Doctor Who thing without Cybermen and Daleks eventually showing up in some form

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.580
or another.

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:05.020
Actually, I bet it's going to have the silence in it, even though the silence did get totally...

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.020
Oh!

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.100
Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.420
But it's being built by Supermassive Games.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.740
They're the ones who did Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves for LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.940
And if there's a PC version, I really hope they do it for Steam.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:27.220
Wouldn't that be awesome if they had a LittleBigPlanet 2 download content pack that was the Doctor?

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220
That would be awesome.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:34.860
But then he'd just walk around Sonic screwdriver-ing everything and doing his timey-wimey stuff.

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.860
I want a TARDIS.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860
I have a TARDIS.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860
Nice.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.460
I totally want this game.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:43.380
You know, one of our listeners in the UK sent me a Doctor Who game a while back.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.380
Yeah, I remember that.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.300
And it wasn't very good, from what I remember.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.140
It was Top Trumps or whatever the card game is.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.140
It was pretty fun.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.460
It actually was really fun.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.180
I had no idea how to play when I first played it.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:59.820
It was so foreign.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.820
It was so, so un-American.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.260
No, I'm kidding.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.580
It was actually pretty fun, but it had Martha in it, so I had to gag a little bit.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.780
Alright, we're going to travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.980
Although we're getting to that time of year where if it was going to come out, it's out.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.700
But there's some coal at the bottom of the stocking if you dig enough, right, Loki?

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.620
Yeah, let me see if I can do this all in one breath, because it's very, very small.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.900
Alright, here we go.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.900
US States, here we go.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:33.860
Alright, we have Outdoor Unleashed Alaska and Africa on the 3DS, Dr. Lork and the Forgotten

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.260
Knights on the 3DS, and I Heart Geeks on the Nintendo DS.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.380
Well this is a big week for DS people.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.500
That was it.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.740
What's I Heart Geeks?

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:49.580
I Heart Geeks is something that's from, remember Mark Echo and the crappy Getting Up game?

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.660
Well Mark Echo is now providing some stuff for this I Heart Geeks.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.220
It's like, I think, The Incredible Machine or something.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.780
That was an epic game on the end.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.900
Yeah, yeah, it was an epic game.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.740
They kind of beat it into the ground.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.980
It's just not quite as cool anymore.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:04.980
I like the box art.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.980
It's cute.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:11.420
I don't even think they even have a trailer for it, but yeah, it's got some artwork by

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.740
Mark Echo and that's about it.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.220
Alright, well let's go over to Japan and check out some release dates in Japan.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.220
I gotta say it's-

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.060
Oh, and I'm sorry, the Oregon Trail 3DS, because I got delayed a week.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.060
Ha, you screwed up.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.060
That wasn't one breath.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.060
Alright.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060
Well I said it last week, so that's alright.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.940
I gotta say, for those of you that like to import your games, especially, we'll get to

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:34.020
PlayStation 3 in a minute here, because PS3 is a region free and all, it's a much more

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.740
exciting week, if you can understand Japanese, because I'll tell you what.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.420
On the Xbox, we'll start with 360.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.900
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Final Fantasy XIII-2, I think there's a few people

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.020
excited about that.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.080
That comes out on the 15th of December.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:51.060
Also this week in Japan, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend comes out this week in Japan,

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:55.020
and Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, if you're into those fitness games.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.020
Final Fantasy XIII-2 here in the States will be coming out on the 31st of January, and-

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.860
Not a bad delay, all things considered.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:10.900
And BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend would be on the 22nd, I believe, of February.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.180
Now PlayStation 3 in Japan has some of the similar stuff.

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:19.060
They also have Final Fantasy XIII-2, but they're also getting a whole darn console in the Final

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.200
Fantasy XIII-2 style, which is weird to me, because they did one for Final Fantasy XIII,

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.180
and I would think any Final Fantasy person probably already bought it back then, but

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.180
maybe I don't know.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.900
I guess this one's a slim, so maybe, I don't know, you need a twin-Z for your other PlayStation

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.900
3?

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:34.900
I don't know.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:35.900
But there's that this week to look forward to.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.060
There's also a couple other games, BlazBlue on the 17th as well, but there's a couple

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.740
other games as well coming out specifically on the PlayStation 3.

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:49.380
One of them is called Rayofu no Melt comes out this week, and that's an adventure game

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.860
that stars anime chicks, so there you go.

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:58.940
And then also Umeneko no Naku Koro ni San Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasuyoku comes out

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:03.420
this week, which is, I'm reading the description here.

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.540
Take another step closer to the truth.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:12.100
The game Battler plays with Beatrice is coming to an end in Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasukyo.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:16.340
I'm trying to think if this is something that exists here.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.880
Oh, it's another racing game, another sim.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.900
That may very well be, oh what the hell, they just announced a sequel to it too, it was

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.420
a PlayStation 3 only game.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:32.560
There's chocolate cake involved, I can see from one of the screenshots here.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560
Chocolate cake.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.340
This game actually has cake, unlike Portal.

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:41.940
Well it's described as having vivid character illustrations and atmospheric music, soundtrack

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.620
with 80 pieces of music in the game.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.660
So there you go.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.180
That is coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.060
So a more exciting week over Japan.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.940
I thought it was the game with the Soul Breed system, I can't remember what the hell it

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.940
was called though.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.180
I had just set up the item too this week, but yet that really stuck in my mind.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180
Can I get this out though?

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:03.020
Do you know what else makes this week exciting in Japan, way more exciting than here?

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.140
The PlayStation Vita is unleashed on December 17th.

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:10.420
So before we have our next show, the Vita will be out somewhere in the world.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.300
And of course, lots and lots and lots of launch games.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.980
I don't really have time to read through them all, but the Vita and all its games are out

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.980
this week.

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:21.300
It's called The Augurist War, but I don't know if that was a record of The Augurist

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:25.500
War 2, which is technically the third game, because the second game was a prequel.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.820
Alright, I'll tell you some of the games that are jumping out at me on the Vita.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:34.180
BlazBlue has a Vita port as well, which would explain why the release of the console ones

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.580
has staggered a little bit.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.580
Katamari Damacy has a Vita game coming out.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:42.660
That I would recommend at launch because it's cheaper and it also has new levels and apparently

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.060
it's pre-fun play.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.980
Michael Jackson, the experience.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.540
Not getting that over here at launch.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:49.540
Ridge Racer.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.420
Don't buy that.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.100
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.780
That's supposed to be pretty good.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.500
And Uncharted Golden Abyss.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.780
That's obviously really good.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:02.220
So Vita's got a really strong launch in Japan, so it'll be interesting to see how...

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.780
Even stronger over here too.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.020
Also a Squeenix game called Lord of Apocalypse.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020
But that's like...

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.440
That's supposed to be awesome looking.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.980
That's like half the games coming out, so it's gonna be interesting to see how the launch

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:18.900
compares to the 3DS launch when 3DS didn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's a

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.580
lot stronger now.

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.940
The PSP is not forgotten.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.180
Just for Dark Sakura, they are releasing on the PSP.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.180
It's actually the Dark Sakura edition.

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.260
No, I'm just kidding.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.660
But it is Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd, low price edition.

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.660
Yay!

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.660
Budget bin edition.

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.660
Woohoo!

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660
Yay!

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:43.220
Trying to look at the Nintendo systems real quick, seeing what the 3DS is countering with

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.220
this week against the Vita.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.100
Puyo Puyo Anniversary Pins Collection.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.800
And Inazuma Eleven Go, dark version and shine version.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.460
Both are out this week.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.940
From level 5.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.140
So that's a sports game.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.140
Puyo Puyo.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.140
Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.500
So a very busy week in Japan.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.980
Not so busy in the UK.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.260
On the 12th we have Gears of War 3 Ram Shadow.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.980
On the 13th is Flat Out 3 Chaos and Destruction for PC.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.900
And also on the PC on the 15th of December is X3 Albion Prelude.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.900
That's about it.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:27.660
I can't tell you what's coming out the week after that though.

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:28.660
The Old Republic.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.660
Alright, we're going to get into some more news here in just a minute.

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.740
We're actually, just for the podcast folks, we lost our live feed.

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:37.740
Winamp crashed.

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.780
That happens a lot lately around here.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.300
I can't figure out what's going on.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.940
If it's not Comcast, it's Winamp.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
I think they're in Kahoots.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.940
If you needed to upgrade a copy of Winamp.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.660
They're in Kahoots!

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:48.660
Perhaps.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.660
I love that word Kahoots.

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.340
Are they making new versions of Winamp?

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.340
I think they do still make versions of Winamp.

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.900
But anyway, we should be reconnected.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.900
So apologies to the live listeners and hopefully we didn't lose you guys during the week.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.260
I don't know how long we were down.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.720
I was so into reading those Japanese releases that Winamp could have been down for 5 minutes

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.720
for all I know.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.720
So I apologize.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.020
I was really looking at it with such intensity on his face that I thought he was going to

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.020
pop a vein.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020
Seriously?

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.020
Alright, wow.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.740
I think it was down for some time.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.740
Sorry guys.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740
Rob Vail.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:18.740
Fired.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.740
No, you're not fired.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.060
Or you're rehired.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.980
I could fire you once and then rehire you.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.980
Alright.

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.020
Let's move on with some more gaming news now that we have our live listeners back.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.580
Sorry, you just missed the release dates.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.580
Sorry.

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.420
Yeah, there's like not much coming out.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:34.060
No, there's a shit ton in Japan.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.300
U.S. and U.S., U.K., not so much.

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:41.300
Japan has the Vita release and a bunch of other stuff to go with it.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.540
People in Japan, send Jamie a Vita so she can review it and talk about you.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:49.540
I thought about buying a Vita from Japan and I thought it was $600 and I'm like, fuck that.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.540
No way.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.540
Sorry.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.340
Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Classic Game of the Week

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.380
and of course our Mario competition soon.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:04.020
So Capcom is actually bringing over some Japanese indie games to PC for North America and Europe.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:07.420
And they're going to be doing some cool stuff.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:14.860
This is with a partnership deal with New Media, NYU, not new.

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:21.120
And I guess they're going to be doing some neat, like a lot of, they call them retro

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.500
chic arcade shooters.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:33.180
For example, they've got, looks like Satsa, Satsa, I can't even pronounce this, Sat-tazu-ts,

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.180
yes.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:43.340
That's going to be coming out, that's available I guess as well on December 20th via Steam

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:49.620
direct to drive Gamers Gate and other major digital distribution services for $6.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:58.180
And then coming early 2012, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, Ether Vapor remaster, Fighting

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:06.100
Fairy, Exceed 2nd, Vampire Rex, and Exceed 3rd, Jade Penetrate Black Package.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.220
I'd play Fighting Fairy.

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:13.980
And I'm going to take a wild guess and say those probably the last two there are shmup

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:19.500
games because that kind of sounds very, you're a shmup, shmuppy.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.420
And yes, I would be accurate on that.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:29.740
Probably very complicated titles and Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, if that's a shmup I'm

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:30.740
going to laugh.

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:31.740
Nope, of course not.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.100
But that would be a funny name for a shmup.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.820
Fighting Fairy is the best name ever.

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.860
It makes me want to kill Navi.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.980
Hey, listen, Squish.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:46.260
Yeah, Fighting Fairy is a fighting game, so they look pretty cool.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.260
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing some of that stuff localized.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:54.140
I mean, it's nice to see that they're bringing that over, even though they don't want to

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:58.220
do a Mega Man game, but whatever.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.180
All right, moving on to just one more story here and then we're going to get to the classic

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.180
game of the week.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:08.820
But first I want to talk about dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, OMG, a Microsoft

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:13.100
app on an iOS device that makes it look like a Windows Phone, sort of.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100
What?

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.100
Here's the deal.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.640
My Xbox Live is a new app that is on the iOS App Store and it's a way for you to integrate

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:23.180
with the new Xbox, you know, um, and this is nice because there were some like fan created

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.460
apps or whatever, or unofficial apps that were decent.

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.060
But now we have something kind of official and you can get on this app and you can see

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.220
what friends are online, what they're playing, compare achievements, all that stuff.

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.180
And what I think is kind of neat, you can send messages.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:38.620
You can actually send messages through the app to people on their Xbox.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.920
Can you play with your avatar?

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.700
So like if Loki isn't listening, I think you can actually customize your avatar.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:44.760
You can, you can.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.720
So like if Loki isn't listening to you because he's too busy throwing carrots in Skyrim,

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.340
you can actually pop it up on his screen through your iOS phone.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.340
Stop throwing carrots, dammit!

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.420
Stop the carrots and pick up the phone and call me or something, you know, something

01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.420
like that.

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.540
So that's pretty cool.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.380
And you can also delete friends from your phone.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.380
Woohoo!

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.380
Yay!

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.420
All these people I don't know.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.420
The app is free.

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.420
So there you go.

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.160
I should go download it now.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.540
And the app is also available on Windows Phones.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.740
Of course, of course.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.980
But it was just kind of funny that it made its way to the iOS app as well.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:23.100
And I believe the Windows Phone app will do slightly more.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.580
I think you can actually look through the catalogs of movies and apps and all that.

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.540
You can queue up movies and control your Xbox using that.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:33.020
Right, which you can't do on iOS because if you sell things to the iOS store then Apple

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.780
gets a cut and Microsoft's not having any of that.

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.660
So you can only do that on the Windows Phone.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:41.260
Well no, I wouldn't see that they wouldn't be able to do that.

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:45.180
It's just they probably, it's a little harder to, well actually I don't understand why it

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.700
wouldn't be harder for them to do that.

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.620
Because you can do that with like Comcast and stuff.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:53.940
I know I could, before when I was paying for like a DVR box and stuff like that, you could

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.820
control the DVR using the iOS app.

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.380
Now as Bobby Blackwolf says in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrager.com, Blackwolf says

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.740
it's sluggish even on an iPad 2.

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.740
Makes me sad.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:05.740
No voice messages.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.740
That's true.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:07.740
You can't do voice messages.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.420
I do realize though, like I just realized this recently, but the Kinect wires your whole

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.400
damn room as a microphone.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.180
Like I can't find the charger for my little wireless headset.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.500
I had it for my Xbox so I have like no headset right now because the cat ate Alan's.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.400
So all we have is the Kinect and like when I'm playing apples to apples I can just talk

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.400
to people.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400
You can't find the charger?

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400
My normal voice, yeah.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400
I can probably find it.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400
I think I have a spare headset too.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400
Woohoo!

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400
That'd be awesome if you have it.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.400
It's a crappy headset.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400
I don't like those wireless ones.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.500
The cats apparently live on a diet of headphone wires and treats.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:37.500
Don't they?

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.220
They do it when we go to Disneyland and don't take them.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.580
That's how they act out.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.940
My cat likes to eat our artificial tree.

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.980
She's just gnawing on it with the cords and stuff.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:50.820
It reminds me of like Christmas vacation with the cat chewing on the cords and plugging

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.820
in.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.820
Hey, the Christmas tree's off.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:57.100
I don't think they chewed on anything when I cats sat last time.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.300
Well that's because you were coming over and giving them pettings.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.300
Yeah.

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.300
And they were like, person, meow, meow, meow.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.940
Now they're being butt heads to me again.

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.860
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.820
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to take a stroll down memory lane.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.420
Dark Soccer will dive into the vault headfirst and find a classic game that she says, hey,

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:21.340
listen up you kids with your Skyrim and your I can't believe it's not Microsoft on an Apple

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.340
phone stuffs.

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.260
You need to go back to simpler times.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.460
We didn't have no cell phone to manage friends lists.

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.420
We didn't have friends lists.

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.260
Yeah, we just had friends.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.740
Back in the days of the Genesis.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.460
Yeah, we didn't play online.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.980
We just had people at our house and they ate all our pizza.

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:39.940
So Dark Soccer, if the kids today want to know what life was like back then, she's going

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.900
to hand pick one game that she thinks she kids should play.

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.940
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.580
The classic game of the week is Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Say Saturn.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.580
Yay.

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:52.740
Now, am I playing the intro here or just the...

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:53.740
Okay, play, okay.

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:54.740
This is what I have to do first.

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.740
Okay.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.920
The game came out in Japan.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.660
It was based off of, it was based off the anime and they had to redo the intro.

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.820
So I want people to hear the difference between the two versions.

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.820
Okay.

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.820
So play the English one first.

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.820
Okay.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.980
Here is the English intro to Magic Knight Ray Earth.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:23.620
A bold, daring dream built of hope, found my chance into the deep end.

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.620
Okay.

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.620
That's enough.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.620
Play the Japanese one now.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:27.620
My music's going to make me poop.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:32.220
All right, here's the Japanese one.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.100
Come on.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:43.540
Here you go.

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.380
Isn't that better?

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.380
Not really.

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.780
She sounds more like a cat in that one.

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.260
Well, okay.

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:55.780
But anyway, they had an even worse version and people complained so much.

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.780
What, the German one?

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.780
No.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.700
Just play music from the game.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.700
All right, fine.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.500
Here is music from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.100
Well, anyway, there was a big anime series called Magic Knight Ray Earth, which was really

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.100
awesome.

01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:13.580
The game was one of the pet projects of working designs and it was the last Saturn game that

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.660
was released in the United States.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:20.300
It actually did not get localized for Europe.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:25.740
So this was a really, really big deal when it came out.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.380
Especially since working designs put so much effort into everything.

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:35.380
But at any rate, you know, as far as an RPG goes, it was actually a very fun little RPG.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:40.300
You have different puzzles and you had, you sort of played as a tag team of your three

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.760
main characters.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.420
You had Hikaru, Umi, and Fu.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:51.060
And basically they just, you know, they got kidnapped into Sephiroth to save the world

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.680
as the Magic Knights and yeah.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.580
If you haven't seen the anime, then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:59.580
it's based off the anime, of course.

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.500
So you upgrade through story progression.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:10.420
However you do get HP and MP, you know, your hit points and magic points are increased

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.420
by finding items.

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:18.020
But most of the character progress is done through story progression.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.660
It had really decent voice acting, I thought.

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.020
It was all people from Redding, by the way.

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.020
Did you know that?

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.300
Because working designs is based off of Redding.

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.300
Really?

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.300
Yep.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.300
There ain't shit in Redding.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.300
You know what else?

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.300
What?

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.900
Our Twilight Zone Pinball was owned by the head of working designs.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:36.900
Oh, awesome.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.700
We got it from him, that's why we have one of the Goemon dolls from the game that never

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700
came out.

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.700
Anyway, back to this.

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.180
Yes.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.580
They have different weapons, usually the Magic Knights does.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:52.220
Hikaru has fire magic and she has a sword.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:57.540
Umi uses a fencing foil and her powers are all water and ice.

01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:01.100
I mean, her name is Umi, which means sea.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:04.660
And Hu is a bow and arrow and wind and healing power.

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.500
So pretty cool.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.900
Fu actually, I think, is probably one of the most useful, you know, because once she gets

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:15.740
her upgrade, she has this lock-on arrow thing, so that's pretty cool.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:20.620
So anyway, with the game that came out, working designs put a lot of effort into it, as they

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:24.420
do with most everything they put out, because they've done a lot of treasure games, they've

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:31.120
done a lot of Sega CD RPGs that we never thought that we would get.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:36.260
So when they did this, they actually, for the whole opening sequence, they did, for

01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:39.780
anyone who's seen the anime, the logo was formed out of these gems.

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:46.240
And so they had a new logo made in English that came the same way, except Media Blasters

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.140
had the rights to rare at the time they designed their own logo, and so they had to use that

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.040
one.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:00.540
The other problem, too, is that most of the source code for the Japanese version was lost

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.540
due to a hard drive crash.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.540
They had to rebuild the game.

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:05.540
Wow.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.540
Yeah.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:12.940
So the code that they were missing had to be completely rebuilt, like I just said.

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:16.320
They did three different versions of the opening song.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:24.180
They were not allowed to use the original for the English release, so they had one with

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:28.340
like completely different lyrics, they had the one that's in the game, and then there

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:36.820
was an instrumental, but the CD that came out with everything had all the different

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.820
versions on it.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:41.980
There was one that was just really hideous, by the way.

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:42.980
So yeah.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.700
There weren't other Rayearth games for the record.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:51.740
There was a Game Boy one that was Rayearth II, The Missing Colors, Mahokishi Rayearth

01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:56.980
II, The Missing Colors is what it was, the Super Famicom, and two for the Game Gear.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.660
And the second one was called Making of Magic Knight, but the only one that came out in

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.300
the US was the Saturn game.

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:11.100
And there, I have to say, because I've seen, well, I've played through some of the Japanese

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:15.160
one, and I've played, of course, the entirety of the US one, and there was a big improvement

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.100
made, and I'll tell you what it was.

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:21.900
In the Japanese one, every time you walked up to a play, and it does this in the US one,

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:26.260
you've got dialogue, they make a comment on everything, except in the Japanese one, they

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.060
said their comment too.

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:31.900
It was like, wait to load, wait to load, wait to load.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.180
They really fixed some of the loading time issues.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:40.380
And on top of that, the packaging was amazing, and each of the discs, well, I would say that

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.620
they had three different variations of the discs, one with Hikaru, one with Fu on it,

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:51.820
and I think I have the mean one, I think my friend has the Hikaru one, Hikari, sorry.

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:58.540
But anyway, it was really good, I mean, there were a lot of people who just thought it was

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:03.460
kind of dull, you know, because it was a three year old game when it came out over here.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:09.340
But I think that if you're into a classic and fun RPG, this one's definitely one to

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:12.060
check out, if you can find it.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:16.780
That's the other thing, it was the last Saturn game released in the US, it might be hard

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.780
to find.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.780
Slightly.

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:19.780
Slightly.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.780
Alright.

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:21.780
It wasn't bad.

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:26.060
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.180
It wasn't bad.

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:31.020
Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Saturn.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.380
I did not know that they were all based in Redding.

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.900
You know what else is in Redding?

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.900
Trees.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:37.460
And lots of them.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:42.540
Alright, we are gonna take a quick break here, and it's gonna go down in Mario Kart right

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:43.540
now.

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:48.300
Get your DS's open, connect to the OL Army room, hopefully you've already added it there,

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.300
and we're gonna get it started.

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:53.580
We're gonna start it live here in just a minute, but I'm gonna break for the podcastees, put

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:56.900
in a quick little break, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.140
Don't go anywhere though guys, we've got plenty more coming up in part B tonight, we've got

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.700
The Last Story is coming to Europe, and we're gonna talk more about that and what it could

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:10.100
possibly mean for America, and of course, a long time coming mailbag, and plenty more

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:20.620
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:24.220
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:29.900
We are live with the second half of our 438th episode for this December the 11th of 2011.

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:34.720
Alright, I know you're all dying to know how the Mario Kart matched with the whopping four

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.060
people that joined in time went.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:45.500
Okay, so first race, I got last place, and I wasn't about ready to commit seppuku live

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:51.500
on air because of it, but it happens, I just wasn't getting, and Loki's like, why aren't

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.500
you drifting?

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.340
I'm like, I'm trying, shut up.

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.540
I redeemed myself a little bit in the second race, I was first place for most of the race,

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:03.700
for most of the race, but then I did a stupid thing, and I tried to take the detour over

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:08.860
to the big ramp, but you really, we were in the Kalamari, or was it Kalamari, Kala something

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:15.980
desert level with the train, it's from the Nintendo 64 one, and I tried to take the shortcut,

01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:20.460
but the shortcut only works if you have a mushroom, and Black Wolf pulled ahead of me

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.300
by mere inches and won the whole thing.

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.860
Curse you Black Wolf!

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.860
Curse you!

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.140
So, but I got second place at least, although somebody, I think it was Zethur, somebody

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:35.780
damn near took over right there at the end, but I was able to just inch out a second place,

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:38.900
so that's much better than the last place I did the first time, so.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.180
Alright, so there you have it, there's your Mario Kart wrap up, we'll try that again next

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.180
week.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.960
Loki's gonna bring his 3DS next week, right Loki?

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.580
And then hopefully some of you guys can chat some more, you'll be able to purchase one

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.580
next week.

01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:49.580
I had to get the game.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.900
I don't think you can do online play with download.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.900
Probably not with download, no.

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.900
But that's alright, I'll play it.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:54.900
You'll have the game by next week.

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:58.180
I've been planning on picking it up, but I was gonna do it this week and I just didn't

01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.180
get around to it.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.140
So, there you go.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:04.540
So I was like third place overall, with the fourth place and second place.

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.140
So I wasn't last, I think Tiger Claw was last, sorry buddy.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:11.540
Might have been Zethur, I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.820
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.700
We're gonna get back into the show here, we got plenty more news to talk about, and of

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:24.220
course we have your calls, your emails, lots of emails tonight, and plenty more to come.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.220
So let's get back into some news.

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.220
Loki.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:30.100
Alright, well let's talk a little bit about Grand Theft Auto, because we haven't done

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:33.620
enough of that since I stopped playing.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:40.260
Grand Theft Auto 3, coming out on mobile devices next week for $5.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:46.580
And of course that will be out on iOS and also Android marketplaces, and is supported

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:56.120
by most of the recent devices, including the Apple iPad 1 and 2, iPhone 4 and 4S, and the

01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.320
fourth generation iPod Touch, which thankfully I have.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:08.220
And also Android phones, the HTC ReSound LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Droid

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:15.660
X2, Motorola Photon 4G, Samsung Galaxy R, and T-Mobile G2X, and of course some of the

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.380
more recent tablets.

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:23.960
And it looks fun, hopefully the controls work out pretty well, and definitely worth picking

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.540
up if you've, you know, I don't know if it supports any Bluetooth controllers, that'd

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.020
be pretty awesome.

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.380
But I'm kinda curious to see how the game looks.

01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:38.140
But $5, so that'll be out on the 15th.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:44.660
And there's a neat rumor going around for the circle pad that's coming out for the 3DS.

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:50.220
Apparently it's gonna run on a AAA battery for 480 hours.

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.140
That's some interesting...

01:36:53.140 --> 01:37:01.260
Yeah, that's a long time, and shit, you know what, Nintendo, you need to learn something

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:07.100
about battery life, because man, those Wii remotes eat batteries like nothing.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:13.500
And this thing, I mean, I guess it just has like an IR relay in it, so maybe it just doesn't

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.220
take that much.

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.640
But beneath that's true, even half that would be pretty good, so.

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:28.020
Nice to know at least I want to replace batteries like crazy, because I'm not buying it.

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:34.460
And finally, Grasshopper and Digital Reality, they have a game coming out called Symora,

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.420
or Cine Mora, I'm not sure how they're pronouncing it.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.060
And it's now gonna be an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive.

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:45.120
It was supposed to be kind of a horizontal shmup game that was with 3D graphics and stuff,

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.540
and kind of a little bit different than Grasshopper, I mean, it's not strange, like, you know,

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:52.420
a lot of the stuff that they normally put out.

01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:56.060
So that's kind of cool that it's gonna be coming out exclusively, though, on Xbox Live

01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:02.140
Arcade, and not sure now if this is gonna be a timed exclusive, or if it's gonna be,

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:06.980
you know, exclusive permanently, but it's still neat, it looks like a pretty awesome

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.340
looking game, especially if you're a shmup fan.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.140
And then of course, they also have another exclusive game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.140
called Diabolical Pitch, which is really weird, I don't know if you remember seeing it, it's

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:23.260
like a zombie survivor horror game, kind of thinking House of the Dead with baseball,

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:30.340
where you're throwing baseballs at zombies, and hitting stuff, and I mean, okay, that's

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:34.860
kind of more of the Grasshopper stuff, where it's just really weird, but uh, that'd be

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.860
pretty cool.

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.940
They need to adapt Battlefield Baseball, because that was a fucking awesome movie.

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:47.020
All right, oops, I'm not ready for that story yet, be quiet, all right, moving on with some

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:50.580
more news, some rapid fire news, well I guess I'll start with that, since the music popped

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.740
up in the background here, what you're hearing there, that's the music, I think this is music

01:38:54.740 --> 01:39:00.860
from the port, it's a Commodore 64 port of the game Cannibal, which to me looks a lot

01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:06.160
like Bit.Trip Racer, or the, what is it, Magic Unicorn game, Comedy Central, that's

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160
on the iPhone.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.500
Yeah, this was kind of the first of that series, I think.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.540
Yeah, but the music kicks ass, listen to this.

01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:23.380
I mean, that kicks a lot of ass, now I don't think that's actually the Commodore 64 rendering

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.580
that, I think that's an MP3, but that's, that's, I mean, the type of stuff that 64 would make,

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.820
and that's a pretty badass sounding song, but yeah, somebody has actually ported the

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.540
game to the Commodore 64, that is awesome.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.980
So you can Google that to find it, because the link's a little bit complicated, but it's

01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:43.860
C64ANABALT, and you can, it's being distributed pretty much as freeware, so you can play it

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.020
in an emulator or what have you.

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:49.220
Or just look at the YouTube, it's YouTube user HeavyStylus, and you can just hear that

01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.020
sweet music that's playing there in the background.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:57.380
All right, some other news for you guys, somebody dared to sue Beyonce last year, remember this?

01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:02.260
A $100 million lawsuit against Beyonce, there was supposed to be a music game that was gonna

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.660
be created all around her, but I guess for whatever reason she stopped it, and 70 people

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.700
lost their jobs over the whole thing, well, you know, think about it, they have that Black

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.180
Eyed Peas game, there's an ABBA dance game, I mean, it's not, there's Michael Jackson,

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:19.140
so it's not unheard of that Beyonce might have her own dance game, but it was stopped,

01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:24.620
and they're now suing Beyonce for $100 million, and I think a lot of people went, hahaha,

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620
that'll be a laugh.

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:31.100
Well, guess what, the lawsuit was around, allowed to move forward, it was not thrown

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:37.740
out of court, so, interesting to see what happens with this as it moves further.

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.580
Sounds like it might have been a breach of contract kind of thing, huh?

01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:43.860
This whole thing started a year ago, just to give you an idea how slow the project's

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.860
moving, so, anyhow.

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:51.020
One other thing that'll be of note to our longtime music game fan folks that, you know,

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:56.020
have listened to the show for a long time, there is a new cell phone, smartphone version

01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:00.200
of Dance Dance Revolution that's going to come out here next year.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.180
It doesn't have a name yet, but they're saying it's gonna be DDR, and it's supposed to have

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:08.260
an emphasis on social gaming, which is ironic, because this whole show started because Dark

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.100
Soccer Loki and I all met playing DDR, it was a very social thing when it was in arcades.

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:16.920
I don't know how you're gonna play DDR on your phone, I think it'll be more like a response

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.420
to Tap Tap Revenge, which is clearly inspired by this title, if you know what I'm saying.

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.820
Inspired by, with quotes.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:28.500
Anyhow, yeah, they're saying it's gonna be more of a social game, and it's in Konami's

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:35.060
social thing such as Dragon Collection, Sengoku Collection, Professional Baseball, Dream 9,

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:39.440
and they're saying it does very well on social networking sites, so we'll see how it does

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.980
over here.

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.620
So that'll be coming out next year.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:45.620
Dark Sakura!

01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:49.260
Well, we have some Tekken Tag Tournament 2 stuff.

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:54.420
The field tests are going on in the US for an arcade version.

01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.100
So five different arcades across the US, that's Next Level Arcade in New York City, Round

01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:03.800
One Entertainment in City of Industry, California, Super Arcade in Walnut, California, Thudworks

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:09.460
in Honolulu, and Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas.

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.820
Also, it's supposed to be coming to consoles, it says Holiday 2012.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.820
There's a bunch of holidays.

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.020
So this is probably gonna be Arbor Day.

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:26.460
Also Mario Kart 7 sold 420,000 units its first week in Japan, and Iwata said that it did

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:29.260
even better across the world.

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.960
So that's pretty good, huh?

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:31.960
Very nice.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.420
Good news for the 3DS.

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:39.660
Last bit, we have some good news for Rock Band fans.

01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:40.660
Rush!

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:41.660
Yay!

01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:46.660
It's the Rush Pack 01 that has Fly By Night, Caravan, and the Spirit of Radio, the live

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:52.060
version, and then individual songs, Rebel Love Song by Black Veil, Brides, and Warriors

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.340
Call by Volbeat.

01:42:54.340 --> 01:43:00.380
And there is a pro bass and guitar expansion available for Fly By Night and the Spirit

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.620
of Radio.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.620
I like Rush.

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.620
Rush is a good band.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.340
You know, that was one of the songs that I was using to test out everything, was Tom

01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.340
Sawyer.

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:12.340
Nice.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.340
I was like, I can't sing that high.

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:16.780
It was pretty funny.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.780
All right.

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:21.220
Well, we're gonna get back into some long gaming news here with Loki, but I wanted to

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:25.540
plug this first because I promised in chat earlier, Derek, one of the other hosts here

01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.620
at All Games Radio does his own show, Dead Pixel Live, wanted me to plug this.

01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.620
And I said, sure.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:34.640
Because I said last time when we didn't participate, because none of us had the game, we would

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.640
try to do the next one.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.380
And I think the prospects for us participating here look much better.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.660
It is the big battle beat down.

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:46.740
It is a fighting game tournament that's gonna take place against a bunch of like radio shows.

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.420
I don't think it's just restricted to all games.

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.340
I think Derek's gonna try and get whoever he can to be a part of this, but certainly

01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.300
we would like the OL army to be a presence.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:57.820
If you want more information, more information is available at thebigbattle.net.

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:00.460
I haven't had enough time since I just kind of found out about this tonight.

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:04.300
I haven't had enough time to go through and look at all the specifics, but I can see that

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:06.780
there are several games that will be involved here.

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:11.620
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat as in the new one, Street Fighter III

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:16.740
3rd Strike Online, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, so a couple Street Fighters and a couple

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:17.740
Mortal Kombats.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:18.740
I kind of like the way that was done.

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.860
You have like the new one and you have the classic one.

01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:25.340
So whether you're a new gaming fan or a classic gaming fan, there's something for you here

01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.960
where you can represent the OL army.

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:28.960
So that'll be fun.

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.500
I don't know what platform the games are on, or if they're gonna do it multi-platform style

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.140
somehow, or if it's like gotta all be on 360.

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.180
But we'll try to get Derek on in the coming weeks, and I think this is not starting until

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.900
next year.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.140
So soon.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.140
But check it out.

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:48.580
You can sign up in advance at TheBigBattle.net.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:53.700
I'm gonna sign up and participate at least in probably the two Mortal Kombat games.

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.780
I think I could do Super Street Fighter IV.

01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.820
Here's my problem though.

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.660
All of them I own on PlayStation 3.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.660
Well, no, I have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox, so I might be able to do some of

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.660
these.

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.660
We'll see.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.420
So we'll figure it out as time gets closer.

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.180
Derek might be in chat too to clarify some of this later.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.860
But I wanted to give a plug for that, because I do want to participate.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:16.300
So prepare to get your ass kicked, DarkSakura.

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.300
Alright.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.300
What?

01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.300
No.

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.300
No, leave my ass alone.

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.300
Yes, I am.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.300
Alright.

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.300
Let's get back into some other gaming news.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.100
Lowkey.

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:31.060
It's been announced that the last story is coming to Europe.

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:37.380
Another one of the Project Rainfall games ported over to English for European players.

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:45.380
It's coming out February 24th, and of course no announcement about a North American release,

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:49.980
but hey, at least you get another game, Europeans.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.380
Another Mistwalker game.

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:53.500
And that's fantastic.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.660
Apparently it's pretty good.

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.860
That means there will be an English translation ready for America to pirate.

01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.020
Very soon.

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:05.460
Which is what I plan to do if they don't announce this anytime soon for the US.

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:10.540
If they're willing to put the US version out within three months or so of the US release.

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.540
I'll wait.

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.540
I don't understand why they can't announce that.

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:19.140
I mean, they could say, hey, they're doing the English translation already, once again,

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:24.340
it requires either no translation or maybe one person working on it for maybe a week

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:32.140
at the most to translate English to US English or American English.

01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:38.940
And honestly, it's fine to replace, I mean, it's so stupid that you know what a jumper

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.940
is.

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:41.660
Do I know what a jumper is?

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.660
Do you know what a lift is?

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:43.660
Yes, I know.

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.660
Do you know what a lorry is?

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:45.660
A lorry?

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.660
A lorry.

01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:47.660
A lorry?

01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.660
I don't care.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:49.660
It's a truck.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:50.660
I thought it was a Hue lorry.

01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:55.380
Well, how many lorries are in the last story, which is a story that took place a long time

01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:57.220
ago, even though it's the last one.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.220
I don't know.

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:02.340
Hey, they can have the last story if we can have the final fantasy.

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:08.040
Seriously, how many final fantasies have we had a bajillion?

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.340
This is the final fantasy we're up to as of right now.

01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.340
We're up to 13.

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:13.340
Two of them put out.

01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:14.820
Oh no, wait, we have 14.

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.740
We have 13 to zero and we have 10 too.

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.740
And we have mystic quest and crap.

01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:23.540
We have a lot of spinoffs.

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.200
It's just what you counted.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.540
Mystic quest.

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.740
You played it.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:30.060
Actually, I ain't even going to lie.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:33.780
I loved mystic quest, but a majority of that was the music was really good for not having

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:34.780
been done by Nobuyomatsu.

01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.460
The music in mystic quest is great.

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:42.400
But yeah, like, you know, I'm not going to beg and plead for the last story.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.940
And if honestly, if it's on something that they just decide, Hey, we're just going to

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.020
put this out, you know, I got, I'm hoping that there's an announcement within like a

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:56.320
week or two because it's ridiculous otherwise, I mean, all you're going to do, I mean, unless

01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.020
are they just going to wait and see how, no, they can't wait and see how the sales are

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:07.480
of, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles or whatever it is because it's not coming out until April.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:09.300
So, you know, I don't know.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.420
I mean, yeah, it may come out over here, but once again, I'm not, I'm not going to rush

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:21.500
out and go get this because I don't know, like it's so easy to import via piracy.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.740
I mean, so yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to just be straight up real.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.540
This is my real answer.

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.580
Again it goes that whole kicking them in their wallet thing.

01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:33.400
Like the ultimatum, if you want to call it is if you don't release it here, I will find

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.180
a way to obtain the Europe one, whether it be legal or more nefarious means in three

01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:44.220
months, you get three months to localize it, then I'm done and pirating it if I have to.

01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.820
That's honestly how I feel about it.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:48.360
Like if you don't want my money, then fine, I won't give it to you.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.980
But I'm sick of this whole, like what they're doing with Xenoblade is just, I mean, I still

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:55.460
don't know what to do about that whole thing.

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:59.900
Like I really want to buy it and support it because it's a great game, but I'm really

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:00.900
irritated.

01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.180
And I think ultimately the end of the day I'll buy it while I'm irritated at two things.

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:09.340
One, I'm irritated that it's this whole exclusive thing with the evil G, which I hate.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:12.000
However, I do understand you can order it from Nintendo.com.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.700
So if, if it's Nintendo shipping it to me and not evil, it's still stupid.

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:18.220
Why is it exclusive to a retail?

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:22.980
I mean, I understand that they may have ponied up money to help import it over fine, whatever

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:23.980
that, that's fine.

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.620
That should have been an issue in the first place.

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.140
Yeah, actually you're right.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.140
It shouldn't have been an issue.

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:31.720
They, uh, a company shouldn't have had to say, hey Nintendo, we're going to pay you

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.300
money to localize it over here.

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:34.740
You don't have to fucking localize it.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:39.100
You have to bring it over here and you know, you, you send a copy of the ESRB so you can

01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.820
get rated, which is just standard.

01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:46.540
And you just put it out over here cause you're publishing, it's first party publishing.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:49.700
Case in point, and I don't think anybody can talk me out of this one.

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:53.100
Dark soccer is on the orange launch tumblr right now, orange launch radio.tumblr.com

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.460
looking at a game called magical jewel pet or something like that.

01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:01.320
If this can be, if somebody is paying for this to come out on the DS, then somebody

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:07.140
can pay for Xenoblade and you can't convince me that Xenoblade, there's something to it

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:12.620
that makes it a bigger, more expensive to do because it's already been translated.

01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:14.460
I don't understand.

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.060
Like there's so much shovelware that comes out on these systems.

01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.980
There's no room for Xenoblade in this.

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:24.580
I don't understand what the, if you've got it translated in English, I mean, I understand

01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.900
if it's a Japanese game that they're just not going to translate into English.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:28.900
Okay.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.900
Yes.

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:33.260
There's an issue there that, you know, bringing it over here may be unrealistic, but if they're

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:39.500
already translating it to English and releasing it in a different part of the world, I don't

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:40.500
understand.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.840
There's no work you need to do.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.840
It's done.

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.180
It's English already.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:52.940
You don't need to translate anything you can't, I mean, last time I checked when you put translate

01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:56.800
English to English and like Google translate, it comes out the same.

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.780
So I don't, I don't understand what they would need to do.

01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:01.180
Can I ask this too?

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.000
What's just, what's wrong with a region free system?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.960
Like for real, like what, why can't our system just be region free?

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:11.620
Like has Sony PlayStation three been hurting because it's region for three free.

01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:16.840
Are we having like rampant issues, like just tons and tons of people getting all their

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.900
games from Japan because of, of the region free thing?

01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:23.220
No, I think the big fucking, I would think if anything, it helps them out.

01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:27.140
The only time that they may have issues where they're maybe losing out a little bit and

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:32.100
not everyone's going to go import stuff because, uh, you know, it's expensive to import some.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:35.940
You're paying almost twice the amount of money that you had paid to buy it locally.

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:40.780
Um, and just for, you know, gain, but a lot of times people are buying like stuff that's

01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.780
not going to come out over here or, you know, RPGs that they want a special edition of or

01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:45.780
something like that.

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:49.220
It's not coming out in the United States or North America or whatever.

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.060
Um, and I mean there's some European games that get released over there first, you know,

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:58.960
like there's maybe some IOS games or a little Square Enix games that are going to be released

01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.960
over there.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.900
You know, I'm fine with Europe getting the game a little early.

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:07.460
I mean shit, they, they get screwed with stuff for us all the time and for them this is a

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.460
great thing.

01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:11.540
So I get it, but it's just kind of one of those whole things where it's like, you know,

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.380
at some point they have to realize, thanks to the internet, we live in a global world.

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:24.140
I mean, so far all the Sony systems from like the PSP, the PS3, and now the Vita is supposed

01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:25.140
to be region free.

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:31.220
I mean, DS was region free and then they decided, eh, let's poo poo on that.

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:35.900
And now, you know, the 3DS, I'm just waiting for them to come out with something to, you

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:38.820
know, like a card reader for the 3DS.

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:43.960
I'm sure there's one out there already, I haven't looked, but, um, cause I mean, that's

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.220
the only way you're going to get stuff.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:48.300
And then you get homebrew and stuff and people modding games, which is kind of cool.

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.940
And I can go have, you know, a good and bad thing.

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:54.940
And then the Xbox 360, believe it or not, is actually region free for a lot of games.

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:58.700
You just have to do your research to find out which ones, but there's some games that

01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.700
you can play.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:04.220
Like, uh, there was the Conan game that came out a few years ago.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.420
That actually came out in Europe a lot earlier than it came out over here.

01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:10.900
Not necessarily a game that you would want to get early, but, I mean, if you wanted to

01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:16.060
play like a God of War knockoff game, and it was pretty fun, um, earlier than you would

01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:20.760
get it here in the States, you could, if you wanted to pay the money to have it imported.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.660
I mean, I don't know, I've done that before with, uh, some of the other Final Fantasy

01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:27.420
games, but not necessarily on PS3.

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:30.980
Alright, I feel like it's just another week and it's the same old rant.

01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:32.060
When will Nintendo learn?

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:33.060
I don't know.

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:36.420
Because it seems like Nintendo's also the biggest offender when it comes to Europe getting

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:37.420
things late too.

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:40.660
Yeah, and here's my problem though with this.

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.580
I don't want to buy this game because, one, it's, I understand if I buy the game that's

01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:50.840
supporting the fact that niche games like this do have a place in the United States,

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.400
but at the same time it also supports the fact that I'm okay with them making us beg

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.300
for this game and then having to jump through all these hoops to get the game over here.

01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.240
So it's kind of like a double edged sword there.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:06.180
I don't know if I should do that or not, and honestly my choice is I don't play my Wii

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.720
very much so I'm just not going to buy the game.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:16.140
And I have a feeling though a lot of these other publishers are kind of doing this, Capcom,

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:20.100
and they're just making people jump through hoops to get a fucking game out of here.

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:24.420
For a franchise, not necessarily a franchise right here, but I mean this is a game that's

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.500
going to do well with the RPG crowd.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.020
I mean you can't expect this to be, Final Fantasy, I mean hell, a Final Fantasy game

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:35.460
or something like that is not going to appeal to everyone, fuck, Skyrim is not going to

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.460
appeal to everybody.

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:40.820
I mean, mom and, your people that are playing Wii Sports and stuff like that don't give

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:41.820
a fuck about Skyrim.

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:45.380
They're just like, they would blow their mind, they're just like, I don't know what to do

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.380
with this.

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:47.380
Too many buttons.

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.380
Exactly.

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:49.380
It's like my wife trying to play it.

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:54.260
I can't look, I can't adjust the camera and move the character at the same time.

01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:55.420
So I mean it just blew their mind.

01:54:55.420 --> 01:55:02.300
So you can't look at it doing as well as like a, you know, a Mario game.

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.900
I mean it's just not going to appeal to everybody.

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.060
But you have to look at the RPG crowd.

01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:10.060
It's got to do better than like Princess Jewel Pet or whatever, you know?

01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:11.740
Yeah, I know, it will do better than that.

01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:14.900
And there's a lot of like Wii games I think that sell based on like box art.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.820
It's like people are like, oh that's a game my son would like or my grandson would like

01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:20.820
and I'm going to buy it.

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:24.700
And I, yeah, there's a lot of crap out there.

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:25.700
Alright.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:26.700
Let's move on.

01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:27.940
We've got to move on with more stories or we're going to be here all night.

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:31.760
So I want to talk about a story about the PlayStation Vita.

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.780
It's not about region free and all that stuff.

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.780
Is the Vita region free?

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.780
I can't remember.

01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.780
It's not.

01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:37.780
It's supposed to be.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:38.780
It's supposed to be.

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.780
They're saying that it is but I don't think anyone's really gotten one.

01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:41.780
We'll find out soon.

01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:44.860
Obviously there's, it's only out in one region and no one's really confirmed either way.

01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:45.980
I think it is.

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:47.900
Alright, we'll find out soon.

01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:52.420
Well some of the rabble that was going on this week, thanks to a NeoGaf post, because

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:56.700
NeoGaf has huge forums and a lot of people post there so sometimes there's some interesting

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.780
leaks and things that come out there.

01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:04.300
And apparently one of the posters was at a PlayStation Vita event in Japan this week and

01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:11.400
apparently the information said that only one user account can be used on the system.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:17.140
So if you tend to share your gaming systems, like say Alan and I do, or Jamie and Dan share

01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:20.860
all their gaming systems, I'm sure, or Loki and Nellie share their gaming systems.

01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:21.860
We do.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:25.620
Well, what system did you try to teach Nellie?

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:27.780
Was it Nellie's copy of Skyrim you tried to teach her?

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.860
No, I don't share portable systems.

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:36.700
Oh, see, well, Alan uses Netflix on the 3DS all the time.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:40.380
Like he uses Netflix more than I do because he really gets a lot of use out of the 3DS

01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:41.380
thing.

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:47.540
But then he'll also play my copy of Mario Kart on my save file, which is okay, it's

01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.540
fine.

01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.540
He's unlocking some stuff.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.900
Like it works great for a game like Super Mario 3D Land where you have three save files.

01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:54.900
I'm number one.

01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.900
He's number two.

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:59.420
And if I ever let a friend come over and play the game, they can have save file number three.

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.420
It works out great.

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.420
Oh, that's right.

01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:02.420
He told me to write over save file one.

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:03.420
Shut up.

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.420
It's true.

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:09.500
But anyway, my point is that some people do, especially couples and stuff will tend to

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.580
share these systems a lot.

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:18.300
So when they heard that only one user per system, it was a little bit of an alarm.

01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:23.580
However, there was a follow up article that came out very quickly afterwards.

01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:28.760
And that is the official line from Sony America quote, your PlayStation network ID is bonded

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.220
to your memory card and your memory card is bonded to your Vita.

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:40.340
So in other words, you can have multiple PlayStation network accounts, each tied to a memory card.

01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:45.460
But if you try to move the account from one card to another, it's going to get more interesting.

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:49.060
And we just had the story last week about all those memory cards now freaking expensive.

01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.060
They are.

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:51.060
Yeah.

01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:52.060
So it's yeah.

01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.060
Like good news and bad news.

01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.060
Good news.

01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.060
Yes.

01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:56.060
You can't have more than one account.

01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:57.060
Bad news.

01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:58.460
You're gonna have to buy more memory cards to do it.

01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.700
And then you can't just move them from one Vita to another.

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700
It sounds like.

01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:02.700
Yeah.

01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:06.460
I mean, honestly, I don't like the fact that they're tied to your to your Vita.

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:10.740
I don't see how that's necessary because what's the point in having a memory card then?

01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:16.340
I mean, I guess someone was saying, well, I can't take my memory card from, you know,

01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.300
one Vita and play it on my friend's Vita.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.580
But it's like, why would you do that?

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:22.420
Just take your Vita with you.

01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:25.540
But I don't know if it's really a problem that a lot of people have.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:30.940
It sucks that they're doing this, tying it to the system and stuff because and it's just

01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:37.480
bad for Sony because this is a problem that will be solved by hacking, unfortunately.

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:44.940
And only creating these problems creates people that want to find the solution for it.

01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:49.900
And the solution is not good for Sony, unfortunately.

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:53.220
Allen's in chat right now, and his feathers are a little ruffled at what I said about

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.220
Mario Kart.

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:57.780
He says, Salacious Pops in chat saying, well, I always win and unlock shit.

01:58:57.780 --> 01:58:59.500
So, you know.

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:02.100
Maybe he's better than better than you at drifting.

01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.540
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps.

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:04.540
Shut up.

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:08.060
I almost considered asking you if I could play your second match.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.140
Oh, I wouldn't let you.

01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:11.140
I could.

01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.140
Oh, man.

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.140
We got to maybe next week, if you don't have your own copy by then I'll let you race during

01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.140
the midpoint break.

01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.140
All right.

01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.140
Anyway.

01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.800
Also, I want to point out what the Rob D is saying in our chat room and chat that orange

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:21.800
on Twitter.com.

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.800
Yeah.

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:25.340
Japan has a totally separate set of standards when it comes to this sort of thing.

01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:28.140
They don't care whether lots of people buy their stuff.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.780
They care about making money.

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:33.100
They will not price niche media and aim for the most sales.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:38.940
They will price niche media for the passionate people and gouge them.

01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:39.940
I mean.

01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:40.940
Okay.

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.940
Listen.

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:42.940
Ironic.

01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:46.180
This is coming right after the Xenoblade last story stuff about gouging niche people.

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:47.180
Listen.

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:49.420
I understand that, you know, the memory cards.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:50.420
Okay.

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:51.420
The memory cards are what they are.

01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:56.420
You're either going to just buy one and just get over the fact that they're fucking expensive

01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:58.500
and just buy one because guess what?

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:04.140
The PSP Memory Stick Pro Duos were fucking expensive when they came out and that shit

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:09.460
came down in price once, you know, other peripherals and stuff were using them.

02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:10.460
Yes.

02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.580
It's a proprietary card.

02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:12.660
Just get over it.

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:15.380
Buy your fucking four gig card or whatever the hell.

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:16.380
Trust me.

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.940
You're not going to need more than four gigs for the system unless you're downloading a

02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:23.960
ton of games online, in which case you can, you know, think about maybe getting a bigger

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960
one later on.

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.100
But, I mean, for me, if I was going to get a Vita, whatever, I'm going to be the only

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:30.100
one using the thing.

02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.460
So, it's not a big deal for me and yeah, it sucks for people that want to share.

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:39.860
It's not the end of the world, in my opinion, is that, you know, as far as, you know, let's

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:43.220
say at Alan and I's house where we're both, you know, big gamers and nerds and stuff,

02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.020
I can kind of say, obviously, I'm getting a Vita.

02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:48.940
I mean, no question because I have to have all the nerd stuff and, you know, it's going

02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:52.020
to be, I think, a good system, got a lot of good games coming on it.

02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:55.620
As far as the save file goes, I at least like the fact that, you know, we could get Alan

02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.060
a cheap little memory card for his saves and then he can have his own PlayStation Network

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.060
ID.

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:04.520
Or, at the end of the day, if it's really just save files, I mean, if a game will still

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:08.940
give you three save slots or something on one memory card, then, you know, or a lot

02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:11.980
of Sony games kind of let you save an unlimited number of files.

02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.900
Like I have like seven saves on White Knight Chronicles 2 just because it just keeps adding

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:16.900
to the list.

02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:18.180
Skyrim, I think I have six or seven saves too.

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:19.180
These are all on PS3.

02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:23.740
So, he can just have his own saves and I don't think he's going to really care about trophies

02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:24.740
on his own account.

02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:25.740
Maybe he will.

02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:29.380
Well, here's what I'm worried about and here's why I think the reason why they're doing this.

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:33.780
It's like on the PlayStation 3, if you download, say download content or whatever, everybody

02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.540
I think on the console can use that.

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:36.540
Oh, no.

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.340
I know where you're going with this.

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:41.700
And so, now, they're going to get you, oh, hey, you like that download content.

02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.700
Well, fuck you.

02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:45.540
You're going to have to buy it for yourself instead of sharing it.

02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:46.780
That is kind of shitty actually.

02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.300
So, that's kind of what they're doing I think with this.

02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.420
But like once again, you know, listen, it is what it is.

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:57.260
You either either just get over yourself.

02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:58.260
You either support it or you don't.

02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:01.220
Yeah, you either get over yourself and buy the system or not.

02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:05.500
I mean, is that really going to hold you back that you got to buy an expensive memory card?

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.100
I don't have to like it and I can complain on the internet.

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:11.900
I mean, just deal with it and that's it.

02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:16.620
I mean, it sucks and I'm sure there will be a third party work around.

02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:21.020
But, I mean, unless you really want to wait for that, and you know what, hey, there's

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.460
nothing wrong with waiting.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.980
Yeah, everybody's going to be buying, well, not everybody, but a lot of people are going

02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:26.980
to be buying it at launch.

02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:27.980
But guess what?

02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:30.820
You know, prices come down, there's bundles that come out later on, you get a bunch of

02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:31.820
free shit.

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:35.220
So, just wait if you're unsure about it.

02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.660
Wait until the following holiday season and stuff and you might score it even cheaper

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.660
than it is now.

02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:44.200
We're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute here, but I want to read one more

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.300
comment from chat from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.

02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:48.300
He's trolling.

02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.300
Listen to this.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:55.180
Bobby Blackwolf says in chat, you mean I could have beaten both Sky and Loki at Mario Kart?

02:02:55.180 --> 02:03:00.200
I think he's throwing down the gauntlet there a little bit.

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:06.580
Could have if you were good enough to beat me.

02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:07.580
It's on.

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.720
It's already been brought in.

02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:09.720
I like this.

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.620
I think we need to do more of this where we play games either right before, well, I don't

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:16.500
want to say before because we don't want to step on Bobby's toes, maybe right after OLR

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:17.620
during the midpoint break.

02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:20.380
I like the idea that people can kind of play games or even during the show.

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:23.540
Shit, I don't care if you're playing Mario Kart right now and like listening to OLR.

02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:27.540
We'll have to play after his show because we don't want him crying during his show.

02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:36.420
Uh oh, uh oh, alright.

02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:42.660
Moving on, on that note, let's get to the mailbag.

02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:43.660
Thousands and thousands of emails received.

02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:48.080
You have to remember, this is the first mailbag since all the website outage stuff.

02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.140
So our emails have been piling up.

02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:52.300
So unfortunately Dark Sakura can only pick a few.

02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.780
Dark Sakura has sifted through the mailbox like it was kitty litter, has sifted through

02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:00.900
the mailbox and pulled out a few nuggets for you.

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:01.900
You know what?

02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:06.060
There's this one Caturday picture that I kept seeing on the web of a cat standing up looking

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:13.060
super surprised, saying, someone keeps coming in and stealing my poop!

02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:15.060
And you just made me think of that.

02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:18.980
So let's see who's poop we've stolen.

02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:23.220
The first one, hi OLR, it's me again, your friendly, catastrophic Moggy.

02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:25.820
I know it's been a while since I last emailed.

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:29.780
After listening to your last show and Rob Stark contrasting with Skyrim and Final Fantasy

02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:35.620
13, the two show clearly the difference between western and Japanese RPGs.

02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.860
Western RPGs mainly focus on character creation.

02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:41.060
You're lucky if you get to even pick a name in a JRPG.

02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:42.060
And world exploration.

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:46.780
While JRPGs focus on story and character drama leading to a much more linear affair.

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.180
Also Rob, have you played either of the first two Elder School games?

02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:52.220
They're both now available as freeware.

02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:55.860
If you think Skyrim is big, you should check out Daggerfall, which boasts a game world

02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:00.140
twice the size of Great Britain that would take over two full weeks to cross in real

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.140
time.

02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:02.960
Yeah, but it's all just an algorithm generated thing.

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:08.500
Of course it is all randomly generated, so it's quite, all quite samey.

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:11.620
Before I go, I just wanted to pass on some preview footage of a game to you because I

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:13.100
know how much you love the series.

02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:16.220
I bet it will be 20% cooler than any other game.

02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:17.220
Hear you later, Moggy.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:22.060
And it is Silent Ponyville, the game.

02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:23.060
Nice.

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:24.060
Oh, can you send me the link for that?

02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:27.940
I want to, I want to, just copy paste and chat so we can, I want to see this Silent

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:28.940
Ponyville.

02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:29.940
Silent Hill.

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:30.940
Hold on.

02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.940
But with my little pony or something.

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:36.860
Um, and just real quick on the whole, uh, um, earlier Elder Scrolls games.

02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:40.180
I haven't really played them a lot in depth, but I'm kind of familiar with them.

02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:45.420
And I especially know the older like PC RPGs, how they used to be like they'd be vast, but

02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:49.540
the dungeons weren't quite as visual as they are now.

02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:53.540
Like people like Skyrim because not only is it big, but it looks real.

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:55.460
Like the, the graphics are getting so good.

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:56.460
All right.

02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.020
Um, I'm going to fast forward here a little bit.

02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:59.020
Silent Ponyville.

02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:01.620
It's exactly what it is.

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:06.780
It's a silent Hill meets my little pony.

02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:07.780
Is there a pyramid head in this?

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:11.180
It comes out and chops her head off.

02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:14.460
This is like some of these art project that they spent a lot of time making.

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.660
Not sure how to feel about this.

02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:19.660
Next email.

02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:20.660
Hi, OLR.

02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.060
Doesn't seem to be anything going on there.

02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:24.540
Brave about ready player one.

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:29.260
I was all ears being myself, rather old gamer started with the C64.

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:33.700
So I bought myself a copy and I've just started, but it really is a page turner.

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:36.100
If you have the chance, do get the author on your show.

02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:40.700
I'm certain that that will result in a very interesting podcast.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:43.260
Best regards from the UK, Mark.

02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:45.540
Uh, so we'll try.

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:47.700
I forgot to look into that, but we will.

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:48.700
Our listeners can read.

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:49.700
Yes, of course they can read.

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:52.100
How dare you insult the listeners from the UK.

02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.340
So I'm assuming you can read.

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:59.060
Therefore he's more well educated, more, more, more better, more smarter, more smarter, more

02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:00.780
better, gooder reader.

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.420
Um, okay.

02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.860
Hey guys, this is blade three, AKA Sam one.

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.860
Well, what are you blade three or Sam one?

02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:08.500
Oh no, Sam.

02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.320
He's not using any punctuation.

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.320
So whatever.

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:17.140
I just wanted to say to Loki that Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly

02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:18.140
like Rob.

02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:20.660
It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.

02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.580
Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.

02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:23.580
Keep up the good work.

02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:24.580
The show is fantastic.

02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:25.860
I've been listening since I five thanks to you guys.

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:29.700
By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut

02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:30.700
some slack.

02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:31.700
Oh, exclamation point.

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:37.460
Seriously, that's the only, okay, I'm going to reread this email the way it's written.

02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:38.460
All right.

02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:41.400
Hey guys, this is blade three AKA Sam one.

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:45.740
I just wanted to say that Loki Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly like

02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.740
Rob.

02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:47.740
It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.540
Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:50.540
Keep up the good work.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:51.540
This show is fantastic.

02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:52.540
I've been listening since I five thanks guys.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:55.840
By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.840
some slack.

02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:57.840
Go.

02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:58.840
So cut some slack.

02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.840
Oh yeah.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:00.840
Why aren't you cutting some slack?

02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:01.840
Oh, all right.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.840
I don't know what the fuck's like.

02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:05.900
Oh, I have heard the, um, Laszlo comparison before.

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:06.900
Actually.

02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.900
You're not the first to mention it.

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:08.900
Funny enough.

02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:11.420
I haven't played enough grand theft auto where I know that.

02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:14.220
I know it's like the one game series I don't play enough of.

02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:16.300
So um, I'll just have to take your word for it.

02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:21.100
I would love to loan my voice to a game sometime though.

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.060
Maybe when they do legend of the magical pony too.

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.060
All right.

02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:27.060
Yeah.

02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:28.060
I want to be in a game.

02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:29.060
Rob.

02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:30.060
I'm going to do voice acting.

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.060
I think it would be fun.

02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:33.340
I think that we would be awesome voice actors.

02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:35.260
I think so too.

02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:39.620
So um, we should do, we should get a video game script and reenact it live on OLR.

02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:40.620
We could do that.

02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:45.380
You know, if we wanted to get someone with the fun voice just on the show randomly, we

02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:47.500
should get agro on here.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:52.620
We should get, do dramatic reading of eight bit video games, strip scripts, but we should

02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:54.740
get agro on here sometime to do his announcer voice.

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:55.740
Oh God.

02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:56.740
Oh God.

02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:57.740
That guy from wow.

02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:58.740
Oh God.

02:08:58.740 --> 02:08:59.740
So cool.

02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.740
Why?

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.740
Hello.

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:02.740
Hi everyone.

02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:07.020
I just finished listening to November's internet outrage ridden podcast and it's one time I'm

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.420
glad I don't listen live.

02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:09.420
Oh yeah.

02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:10.900
Well I'm not going to read it.

02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.220
No, sorry.

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.780
Anyhow, being an avid Android gamer, I wanted to chime in with my suggestions for your Twitter

02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:22.300
topic poster all reviewed in 140 characters or less ish so dark soccer can read them without

02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:25.180
having kittens because that just makes sure me feel inadequate.

02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.180
Well, that's okay.

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.180
Cause sure.

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.180
Me can't have kittens anyway.

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:29.180
She's too old.

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:30.180
Her uterus fell out.

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.700
No, that got yanked out when she was a kitten.

02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:33.700
Okay.

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.700
Angry.

02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:35.700
She's looking now.

02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.700
She heard her name.

02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:37.700
She heard her name.

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:38.700
She's like, you talk about my uterus.

02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:41.860
She's like, girl, I haven't had a uterus since.

02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:45.180
What's uterus talking about Willis?

02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:49.100
How many times can we say uterus in one radio show?

02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:50.100
Angry birds.

02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:54.340
If I had my eggs, I'd go after them too, so have a fling and smash those pigs asphalt

02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:57.940

02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:02.860
You have a study rests asphalt HD graphics update for higher end devices and tablets.

02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:07.880

02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:11.980
dragon attack action with challenging battles in a variety of party and equipment options.

02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:13.980
Not much of a story though.

02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:16.700
You getting her on the radio?

02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:18.740
I'm trying to get sure me to review the games.

02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.220
You hear me?

02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:21.220
Hey baby.

02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.220
All right.

02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:23.220
No.

02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.220
Okay.

02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:25.220
Yes.

02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.220
That's how I talk to my cat.

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:27.220
Um, bonsai blast.

02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:31.380
Japanese Zen flavor Zuma clone with high replayability value for those five minute potty breaks for

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:33.500
peace and calm are oh so important.

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:36.620
Dr. Stanley's house one and two point and click mystery game.

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:38.420
You misspelled mystery by the way.

02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.500
With a twist ending ported from a flash game.

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:41.500
Duck hunter.

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:44.780
Think SNES classic minus the dog with really funny foul play.

02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:46.260
Ah, I see your pun.

02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:47.260
Haha.

02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:48.260
Fruit Ninja blah.

02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:49.260
Yeah.

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.780
Care for fruit salad and have a minute to lose.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:53.060
Flick at your screen and get as many fruits before the time runs out.

02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:54.060
You'll have a blast.

02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:57.700
You're still trying to make my cat talk.

02:10:57.700 --> 02:10:58.860
I'm rubbing her belly.

02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:00.300
She likes it.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.900
Hexa dictus hexagonal match three puzzle game.

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:03.900
No, really.

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:04.900
That's about it.

02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:05.900
Kid mode.

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:09.300
Great for parents with kids two through 10 with edutainment options galore activity reporting

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:12.060
family muffin night.

02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:13.900
What the crap game is that?

02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.480
Pumpkins versus monsters.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:16.480
It's a clone.

02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.480
Um, you know what?

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.180
I'm not reading the rest of this.

02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:23.140
Um, well hopefully at least one of them sparked your listeners or your interest.

02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:24.140
Listen to you next week.

02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:25.140
Dr Noir.

02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:29.660
Well, I wanted to hear more about pumpkin whatevers, but our soccer was like, no smiley

02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:31.660
pops.

02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:38.780
PSS email is written at 5am while waiting for a delayed flight back to Mexico at a Colombian

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:40.420
airport with no coffee available.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:41.980
I know ironic, right?

02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:43.620
After four straight 15 hour workday.

02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.700
So if I misspelled something, blame it on the exhaustion.

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:51.420
Okay, I forgive you this time and I'll, I might go post your list later.

02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:54.500
I'll put it on the tumbler eventually.

02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:57.860
Xbox has followed in the footsteps of PSN network.

02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:00.140
That's redundant, isn't it?

02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:01.140
PSN network.

02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:03.300
That's like ATM card or pin number.

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.100
Are you thinking ATM machine?

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:06.100
Yeah.

02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:07.500
ATM machine and pin number.

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:08.500
Yeah.

02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:13.580
Um, I've linked an article though I actually didn't hear about it from them.

02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:18.300
My husband is in law school and he actually reads the terms of service before he agrees.

02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:22.460
Anyway, the overall impression he gave me was this is a crappy backhanded move, but

02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:25.780
as far as crappy backhanded moves go, it's not so bad.

02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:29.260
Essentially while they block you from class action, they agreed to pay all fees associated

02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:34.420
with arbitration and formally agreed to pay a thousand dollars or what the arbitrator

02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:37.500
decides is fair, whichever is greater.

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.500
It's still crappy though.

02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:41.540
And that's from Holly D.

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.700
It's still crappy.

02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:43.700
It's still crappy.

02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:44.700
But I agree.

02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:45.700
Less crappy.

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:48.220
Uh, this is from Robobobobobobobob.

02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:51.860
I sent the following email to my state's consumer protection division of the attorney general's

02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:52.860
office.

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:53.980
I'll let you know what they reply.

02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:58.940
I did discover that my mandatory arbitration can be disputed if you feel treated unfairly.

02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:02.900
Oddly enough, it would take something extraordinary for me to want to sue a game system manufacturer.

02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:03.900
And it's from Robobobobob.

02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:05.460
Like I just said.

02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:06.980
And this is the email.

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:11.220
I give this guy massive props for actually doing something about it though.

02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:17.340
Lately, video game console manufacturers are updating their EULAs for operating their game

02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:19.860
systems with mandatory arbitration clauses.

02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:26.900
Are there sources of information on what clauses are allowed in EULAs and what clauses are

02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.940
invalidated by Maryland law?

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:33.420
As for my own opinion, it doesn't seem wrong, no, it seems wrong that an expensive electronics

02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:37.340
device can be rendered useless if you don't agree completely with the EULA.

02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:40.860
Thanks for any response, Robobobobobobob.

02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:43.620
That's not how he signed it, but I'm still saying it.

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.660
I still want to see what reply.

02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:46.660
Okay.

02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:48.660
And, um, that's it.

02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:49.660
All right.

02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:50.860
I mean, that's not it.

02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:54.180
Of course, for emails, we got a bajillion emails.

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:55.500
It's been building up for like a month.

02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:56.500
Keep in mind.

02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:57.500
But I ain't reading anymore.

02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:01.220
But if you would like to be considered for next week, we read them all at least mailbag

02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:03.580
at orange lounge radio.com.

02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:08.140
And by the way, you have a better chance if your email is like concise, just so you know,

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.860
because the run on ones are a little harder to read.

02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:11.580
So there's one more I want to read from Robobobobob.

02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:12.580
All right.

02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:13.580
It's older.

02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:15.460
The Peeta Tanooki suit thing is still topical.

02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:17.780
I'll show you my thesis on this.

02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:19.460
I love how he writes, though.

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:21.940
Peeta is intentionally grabbing negative attention for donations.

02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:24.460
It has nothing to do with what they are trying to protect.

02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:29.020
How better to get attention by being negative publicity about a beloved icon?

02:14:29.020 --> 02:14:30.020
Peeta's logic is this.

02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:33.100
An imaginary character wears an imaginary suit with special powers.

02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:37.940
This Tanooki suit resembles a Tanooki fur, which a Tanooki is a mythical creature burglarized

02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:39.900
as a raccoon dog.

02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:44.380
So the imaginary prospect of killing an animal is bad slash evil, so send money.

02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:48.940
Peeta is pretty famous for flinging fake blood on real furs to demonstrate the cruelty of

02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:51.300
the fur industry and equating fur with murder.

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:54.660
So their fake blood is that of a fake animal or worse, of a fake human.

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:57.940
By their own logic, they are advocating animal slash people slaughter.

02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:01.140
I think Jamie said it best, which she said a few weeks ago, Peeta is crazy.

02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:04.060
Of course, that's why people love picking on Mickey Mouse, too.

02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:05.940
Okay, that's it.

02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:06.940
All right.

02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:09.700
We're back at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:12.780
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because it's our show

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:15.980
and sometimes we have angst and we have to get it all out in a segment called The FUs

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:33.220
of the Week.

02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:40.580
A big FU goes to the increased militarization of national police forces and to there not

02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:46.580
being enough change in the way people vote to where we still have assholes in office

02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:53.060
and also to assholes running for office who like to wear the same jacket from Burbank

02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:54.060
Mountain.

02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.060
Uh, Logie.

02:15:55.060 --> 02:16:03.940
Fucking in my radio in my car because apparently the track skip forward button is starting

02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:09.900
to break and so sometimes it thinks, or actually most of the time now, it thinks I'm hitting

02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:17.380
track backwards and then sometimes it thinks I'm also changing the mode of my, you know,

02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:20.140
player to play the radio or something like that.

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:23.100
Or sometimes it will actually work and go forward.

02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:28.700
So that fucking sucks because now it's making it very difficult to pick the song I want

02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:29.700
to listen to.

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:35.540
Alright, my FU, uh, first one goes to Rick Perry because he's such an assbag and I have

02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:36.540
a right to say that.

02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:39.100
I believe that Rick Perry is an assbag.

02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:40.100
And you know what?

02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:45.620
I imagine when you said assbag, he was actually the bag that attaches to a colostomy.

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:51.900
That's pretty much what he is and just, just discussing and gross and insulting the way

02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.260
he's pandering people.

02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.380
It's just insulting.

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:58.180
So just, I don't know, barf barfy barfs.

02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:03.620
Did you see the thing that Santorin said, Oh, that guy, he's even bigger of an idiot.

02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.700
Oh my God.

02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:05.700
So many.

02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:11.580
And like, I'm really trying not to be like all one side or the other, but like, let me,

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:17.260
here's the nice thing I can say about the dog and pony show that's going on over there.

02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:23.460
Some of them know when to keep their mouth shut and that's, that's a good compliment,

02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:26.540
but some of them need to learn such humility.

02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:32.740
It's just, so anyway, um, without getting too political, whoops.

02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:37.560
But my other FU, I will say that's a little sillier is FU to, um, FU to the fact that

02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:42.660
in looking for raid in world of Warcraft, um, that only one piece of gear has dropped

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:43.660
for me.

02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:47.540
Can I add to that too FU to that pug last night.

02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:51.140
You need, you need to do what I do and start writing down their names and servers and reading

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:52.380
it on the Horde house.

02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:53.380
John wrote them all down.

02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.380
Oh, did he?

02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:55.380
Yeah.

02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:56.380
We were going to email you.

02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:57.380
Oh, you should.

02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:58.380
You should do that.

02:17:58.380 --> 02:17:59.380
They were all from the same server.

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:00.380
All right.

02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:01.380
Dick faces.

02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:02.380
So, all right.

02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:03.380
Uh, there you go.

02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:04.540
That's, that's it for the FUs of the week.

02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:07.460
Just a few more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at one eight seven

02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:12.240
seven game O L R or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio at us on Skype.

02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:14.780
If you haven't already, but we'll get to that in a minute.

02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:15.780
First more stories.

02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:16.780
Lucky.

02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.780
Yes.

02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:24.100
Uh, this is kind of neat on live is finally coming to the iOS platform as well as Android

02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:30.740
and uh, it's really, you can actually use it to, um, play games on your tablet or phone

02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:31.740
device.

02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:36.660
Um, they also are going to be selling a wireless controller that comes with the free app download

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:42.660
as well for about, I want to say 50 bucks, uh, which also is the same price as the streaming

02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:44.460
console if you really want to.

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:50.180
Um, and it is Bluetooth and allows you the, you know, basically use your tablet as you

02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:56.540
know, a screen instead of having to use the on screen touch sensitive buttons and stuff

02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:00.100
that they have, which they have that option if you don't want to do that.

02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:04.700
Um, and apparently also some of the games that they're, they're actually converting

02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:07.660
over to work with the touch controls on these tablets.

02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:12.260
Like for example, LA noir was something that rockstar games is actually going back and

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:17.460
um, you know, fixing that up so that you can use, you know, touch controls with the game

02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:18.460
as well.

02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:24.100
Um, and I want to say there was a kingdoms, uh, was a kingdom of keffi limbs, uh, that

02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:27.900
was also going to be getting the kind of the same treatment as well.

02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:32.940
Um, it just looks kind of neat and I guess it works pretty well.

02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:36.900
Um, I actually thought about downloading this to try it.

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:40.780
I don't know if I have to actually purchase the app to check it out, but obviously you

02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:44.300
need an online subscription and stuff, but it'd be neat to check out.

02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.300
Not necessarily.

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:50.460
I like, I would not want to play on my iPod though with the screen controls cause I can

02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:53.260
imagine my, my hand would cover the whole damn thing.

02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:56.200
Um, but it's still kind of neat that they could do this.

02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:01.580
You know what would be really cool, I guess, I don't know if that, if it has the power

02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:07.100
to do that, but, um, the Apple TV, you know, if you could do an app like that, but you

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:11.280
know, with the rumors around the corner that, you know, Apple is actually creating their

02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:16.260
own TV set soon, this very well could be integrated into something like one way to get more Apple

02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:17.260
TVs sold.

02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:20.780
Like I'm talking about the actual set top boxes, just build it into an actual TV.

02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:21.780
Yeah.

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:27.620
So, um, make them in cool colors and everybody will want one that it's an interesting prospect

02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:31.340
that, you know, this is gonna, if it worked, I mean, it works pretty good.

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:36.740
Um, of course the only downside is obviously it's not going to work as good as your, you

02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:42.780
know, streaming console because, you know, those are normally wired connections versus

02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:43.780
this.

02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:48.220
You probably want to be on wifi to be able to play the games, you know, full resolution

02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.580
without any lag.

02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:53.220
Um, although from what I was reading, like, you know, games are normally 60 frames per

02:20:53.220 --> 02:20:58.660
second, it was 50 frames per second and you know, maybe the resolution's a little lower,

02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:02.020
um, than it would normally be, but, um, overall, not too bad.

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:07.660
I actually saw some gameplay footage of someone playing, um, saints row the third on an iPod

02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:09.060
or something like that.

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.060
Wow.

02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:15.140
So that was kind of cool looking saints row third on the go as tempting.

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:20.740
But uh, um, yeah, I don't know, it's a really neat, neat idea.

02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:24.340
So it'd be interesting to see, you know, what games are support right now.

02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:29.420
They don't have all of the games obviously supporting this, but, um, they're launching

02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:36.840
with about 18 games and, um, you know, I guess they launched originally with 21 games when

02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:43.180
the streaming console came out and, um, you know, they're going to be adding more as they,

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:47.940
you know, convert some over and, um, get them to work a little bit better with the portable

02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:48.940
systems.

02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:49.940
All right.

02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:50.940
Very interesting.

02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:53.060
The way this technology is going, I think this could be a pretty huge in the future

02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:57.140
because even if it's not on live itself, people are going to see what on live is doing and

02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:01.300
think, Hmm, how can we do that for our gaming experience?

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:04.420
It's just a matter of time before developers just cut out on life completely.

02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:09.340
I mean, especially on something like I asked why the only thing you need on life for is

02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:13.740
their bandwidth and maybe I don't think the technology is particularly proprietary because

02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:14.740
there are competitors.

02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:18.620
Like there was that whole FIFA streaming to YouTube thing that was not, that was Genkai

02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:19.700
or whatever.

02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:22.500
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:24.780
Anyhow, uh, I want to move on to another story.

02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.940
This had the game world talking this week.

02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:32.460
This is huge news this week because a wired had a, uh, interview with Miyamoto and they

02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:37.660
ran the headline is the headline quote Nintendo's Miyamoto stepping down, working on smaller

02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:41.820
games and everybody took that and literally this around the rest of the internet and intent.

02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.380
Uh, Miyamoto is quitting.

02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:48.540
Nintendo Miyamoto is retiring because people read into that saying Miyamoto stepping down

02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:53.140
and they kind of missed the hidden subtext and, and granted this headline is a little

02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:57.900
bit sensationalistic, but that's the way headlines are kind of written to be, um, is that Miyamoto

02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:02.580
stepping down from the Mario and Zelda games that he's been working on.

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:08.060
And and of course, Nintendo followed this up with an official quote where Nintendo is

02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:11.460
basically like, no, no, no, Miyamoto is not retiring.

02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:15.540
Uh, video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto's role in Nintendo is not changing.

02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:19.160
He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts in discussing

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:23.480
his priorities at Nintendo in a media interview, Mr. Miyamoto explained how he is encouraging

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:27.180
the younger developers of the company to take more initiative and responsibility for developing

02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:28.180
software.

02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:31.300
And in fact, if you kind of go back to the original interview, here's what the wired

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:36.540
article says, quote, inside our office, I've been recently declaring I'm going to retire.

02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:37.740
I'm going to retire.

02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:40.860
I'm not saying that I'm going to retire from game development altogether.

02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:44.720
What I mean by retiring is retiring from my current position.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:48.720
What I really want to do is be in the forefront of game development once again, myself probably

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:53.040
working on a smaller project with even younger developers, or I might be interested in making

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:57.040
something that I can make myself by myself, something really small.

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:01.140
In other words, I'm not intending to start from things that require a five year development

02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.740
time when all is said and done.

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:06.900
The internet was making this sound out to, uh, out to sound like bad news.

02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:09.620
I think this is great news.

02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:11.300
I think this is fantastic news.

02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:15.820
I don't think Miyamoto should be taking all this time to work on Zelda and Mario games

02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:18.580
when the, um, outlines are pretty much all laid out.

02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:22.660
I mean, I think he should be there to give creative input and so forth, but, but that's

02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:23.660
really it.

02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:27.580
I mean, these, these things are in kind of capable hands now, you know, Miyamoto ain't

02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:28.960
getting any younger.

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:33.460
He's been making games since the original NES, which just celebrated his 25th anniversary.

02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:38.500
So I would like to see before he really does have to retire, I mean, all good things must

02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:44.180
come to an end folks, someday Miyamoto is going to die.

02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.340
So I hope it's not for a long time.

02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:51.700
I'm not saying anything rude, you know, I'm just saying inevitably someday orange launch

02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:53.900
radio will end.

02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:55.780
It has to end at some point.

02:24:55.780 --> 02:24:59.140
I'm not saying it's going to end next week and we're going to try to go as long as we

02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:00.660
possibly can.

02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:04.320
Someday grandma will grab Pogo to die.

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:08.020
But my point is, you know, maybe Miyamoto is like, do I really want to spend the rest

02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:12.100
of my years in Nintendo working on another Zelda game?

02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:14.700
You know, no, let's, let's, let's somebody else kind of do what they want with Zelda

02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:18.900
and I want to try something new or I want to go back to the way we used to do it and

02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:23.260
I'm going to try to do a game on myself because remember a lot of those Atari 2600 games back

02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:25.940
in the day were programmed by like one guy.

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:30.980
So I would like, I think Miyamoto should spill out more of the contents of his brain for

02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:31.980
us to consume.

02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:32.980
You know what?

02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:39.620
I'm stuck, but what if in that brain of his is the next Mario or the next Zelda?

02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:42.420
I mean, aren't you all complaining at the same token?

02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:45.500
I'm kind of sick of Nintendo putting out the same shit over and over again.

02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:48.060
Then let Miyamoto develop something else.

02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:52.160
This is fantastic news.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.860
You get limited when you're stuck with the same thing over and over again.

02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:57.540
It's the same reason why actors don't want to be typecast.

02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:59.420
Don't you think?

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:00.420
Yes.

02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.420
Same thing.

02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:04.580
And of course now the chat room is running with this act deft.

02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:05.940
Miyamoto will never die.

02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:07.700
Don't say such cruel things, Rob.

02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:08.700
Alpha-canonogram.

02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:09.700
Miyamoto, die.

02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:10.700
Kill the non-believer.

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:12.100
Well, I will say this.

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:13.100
I will say this.

02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:15.740
This is a high compliment.

02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:20.040
When the inevitable happens and Miyamoto passes away, think of it this way.

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:26.080
The work that he's created in some ways kind of defines this generation.

02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:28.740
It defines a part of our culture.

02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:34.140
And some of us could only be so lucky to have really made that kind of impact on the world.

02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:37.600
I mean, Miyamoto made an impact on the world.

02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.580
So in that sense, Miyamoto is immortal in that sense.

02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:45.140
You want to take this to a weird deeper level.

02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:50.020
In some ways, what we've done here at Orange Lounge Radio has had an impact and that makes

02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:52.260
me feel really good about what we do every week.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.260
Not nearly the impact.

02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:57.880
I wouldn't say we've been a cultural revolution, but if you're tuning into this program and

02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:00.940
spending your night with us, then we've had a little impact.

02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:02.900
We've had a little impact.

02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:06.380
So that's pretty cool.

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:07.380
Right Darsakra?

02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:09.380
You haven't been listening to me at all, have you?

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:13.460
Yeah, no, I was, but I actually just had a Brush with Celebrity moment.

02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:14.460
Oh?

02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:18.360
One of my favorite people ever who's been on a reality show.

02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.580
And I'm not a big reality show person, but I love MasterChef.

02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:28.740
Ben Star, the guy who has fourth place on the season before last, just said that he

02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:30.900
thought that my dish sounded delicious.

02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:35.760
I asked him for advice when cooking a butternut squash.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:37.700
Just because I was like, I'll ask a pro, why not?

02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:42.540
And he seems to reply to people, but he gave me his method, but he gave it to me 20 hours

02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:43.540
late.

02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.980
So he's like, so what did you end up doing with it?

02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:49.480
And I said, oh, I cooked it and it was still firm, so I saved it to microwave.

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.560
And I said, I mixed this, that, and the other, and he said, that sounds really yummy.

02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:56.720
So I was like, I got a compliment.

02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:59.920
It's always a little bit fun when a quote unquote celebrity, no matter if it's A-list

02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:01.700
or F-list, kind of interacts with you on Twitter.

02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.700
That's why Twitter is so popular.

02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:04.340
Well, no, not on Twitter, on Facebook.

02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:06.380
Well, still, same idea.

02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:10.780
But he's actually one of the people that I learned the most from watching that show on

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:13.700
cooking dishes, because he's traveled and been to places.

02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:15.140
Okay, let me put it this way.

02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.660
When I followed George Takei on Twitter, he sent me a direct message.

02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:20.380
You know, it's like, thanks for following me and all that stuff.

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:21.380
Like I know he didn't write it.

02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:23.440
I know he's got people that, you know, probably do that stuff.

02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:24.700
He's not sitting there at his computer all day.

02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:27.360
He's got better things to do.

02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.020
And probably a lot of that stuff he posts to Facebook too.

02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:33.320
Like some of it might get his approval, but he probably has a whole team of people that

02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:34.320
maintain his public image.

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:37.500
And I'll tell you this, they do a damn fucking good job.

02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:41.920
George Takei's people team is probably some of the finest in the industry, if you think

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:42.920
about it.

02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:45.540
I mean, like George Takei's stuff is all over Facebook.

02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:48.020
His tweets get retweeted all the time.

02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:53.220
He's like, he's even more legendary than Betty White in social media, dare I say it.

02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:56.340
Which brings me back to the idea of, didn't we have a sitcom idea this week where it was

02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:58.900
like George Takei and Julie Andrews raising you?

02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:04.180
Yeah, no, I said, I said that I, that I wish that I, I love my family, but I wish that

02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:08.340
I had been adopted by George Takei and Julie Andrews or, you know, if they were really

02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:13.980
my parents and I would be half Japanese with an amazing singing voice, you know, and probably

02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:14.980
raging lesbian.

02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:16.980
All right, let's move on.

02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:18.340
Just a few more news stories for you guys.

02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:19.340
Dark Sakura.

02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:20.340
Oh yeah.

02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:21.340
I do have another story, don't I?

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:22.340
Yes, you do.

02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:25.580
How about a little bit of technical comparison?

02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:33.040
Batman, Arkham City, the PC versions and the console versions, they're actually saying

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:40.980
that they really, really wanted to bump it up and make it look really good.

02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:46.960
They had it set to run for DirectX 11 so that it was as clean and perfect as it could even

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:50.620
though for the smoother gameplay, they said, keep it to nine as it would be comparable

02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:52.420
with the consoles.

02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:58.820
But they apparently just had it to look amazing for the PC players that had the best systems.

02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:02.300
So I was looking at some of the comparisons on here.

02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.500
And Arkham City's already a gorgeous game.

02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:05.500
Good lord.

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.500
Yeah.

02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:11.380
Well that, that at least makes the delay between versions a little more worth the wait if they've

02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:13.220
managed to tweak it to look even better.

02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:16.900
I mean, granted, you probably need the highest of high end systems to be able to really see,

02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:18.780
but it's still pretty cool.

02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:23.940
But see, they're showing it versus the PS3 and the PC, some of the difference in the

02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:27.620
shading effect and the textures.

02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:36.380
It actually, and I have to say, cause we have the PS3 one here, as clean as it was, I mean,

02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:43.740
it's really hard to compare a console with a PC when the PCs are consistently upgradable.

02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:52.780
You can get the best stuff for it, but as beautiful as the textures and the lighting

02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:58.620
and everything in the PC one was, it actually really makes me appreciate the PS3 version

02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:05.120
because it really is pretty close, even though, I mean, yeah, tech spec wise, the PC one will

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:11.600
blow it out of the water, but the PS3 version really keeps up.

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:12.600
It's a gorgeous game.

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:13.600
Absolutely gorgeous game.

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.600
Yours is best.

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:18.900
But there are also some other improvements too, just in the PC one, other than the higher

02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:26.180
resolution textures, they actually, it's all the stuff that you see up close, like pores

02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:27.500
and indentations under the skin.

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:28.500
You can see veins.

02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:34.300
I mean, they really put a lot of effort into making it look realistic.

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:35.300
I want to go back to chat.

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:39.220
The chat room's a little bit delayed, but there was a great quote here from chat on

02:31:39.220 --> 02:31:40.220
the Miyamoto thing.

02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:43.540
I want to read this real quick here from Midori in our chat room at chat.orangesonshreddy.com.

02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:45.580
I love your drinks.

02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:51.020
He, meaning Miyamoto, will be immortal, but I understand that if I had the choice, I'd

02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:55.820
want to be known for making the most favored characters over how many games I could develop

02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:58.180
for a few loved characters.

02:31:58.180 --> 02:31:59.540
That's a really good way to sum it up.

02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:02.660
So I just wanted to throw that out there because that mirrors my thoughts very closely.

02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:06.220
All right, just a couple of quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line is going

02:32:06.220 --> 02:32:07.220
to open up.

02:32:07.220 --> 02:32:08.220
So, Loki.

02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:10.260
All right.

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.640
So this is neat, I guess.

02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:20.060
They're going to be giving a little bit of bonuses for fans of Final Fantasy XIII-2 or

02:32:20.060 --> 02:32:21.460
even the original Final Fantasy game.

02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:25.100
If you play the original Final Fantasy XIII game and you have a game save, you're going

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:30.300
to be getting some special features, including special monster decorations and a higher success

02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:31.300
rate at the games.

02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:32.820
I guess they have a gambling area.

02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:37.980
I wonder if it's anything like, what was that in Final Fantasy VII, like the golden something

02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:38.980
or other.

02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:39.980
I can't remember what it was called.

02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:44.180
Time of lucky hit.

02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:47.700
Also I guess they're saying that the game's going to be broken up in the episodes and

02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:50.300
each episode will be about three hours long.

02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:54.580
Also going to be adding an auto save system as well as the ability to save in different

02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:55.900
places.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:33:01.740
Plus there's going to be a new game plus mode that adds, I guess, unlockable items and also

02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:05.340
new monster decorations as well.

02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:09.900
And neat, I mean that extra stuff is good.

02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:13.540
I know that they're going to be doing some DLC though for it and I think that's kind

02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:16.460
of ridiculous as far as what they're adding with the DLC.

02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:21.260
I think more monster decorations, but remember it's optional, you don't need to buy it.

02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:28.340
Well that's good as long as it's extra frilly stuff and not necessary to the game's completion.

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.060
But the game's sounding better and better, I can't wait to play it.

02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:33.740
I really need to actually finish the last chapter of Final Fantasy XIII.

02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:38.100
I was digging through my bag the other day and I saw Final Fantasy XIII there, I'm like

02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:41.140
oh yeah, I need to finish that.

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:44.140
By the way, chat room to the rescue on the gambling thing of Final Fantasy VII, Gold

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.140
Saucer.

02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:47.380
Yeah, it is Gold Saucer.

02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:51.420
Alright, and one more Final Fantasy related story for you guys this week and it has to

02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:53.940
do with Final Fantasy XIV.

02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:54.940
Guess what?

02:33:54.940 --> 02:34:00.940
They are going to charge service fees for Final Fantasy XIV.

02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:02.940
I'm not playing.

02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:06.020
Final Fantasy XIV, here's the deal.

02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:09.780
They will be implementing the fee change on January 6th.

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:14.660
This has been pushed back a little bit, it was supposed to start by now essentially.

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:18.960
So on January 6th they are going to start the new pricing structure.

02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:23.660
So what will happen is that the subscription fees, this is weird, the basic service is

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:32.500
$6.99 for 30 days and then the real subscription fee when the new version starts will be $9.99

02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:34.020
for 30 days.

02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:37.140
That's kind of weird the way that's set up, but there you go.

02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:41.060
And if you want extra characters, that's the other weird thing, it's $3 a character.

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:45.740
So it's definitely cheaper than $14.95 but still, I mean that monthly fee, it's going

02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:47.940
to be very interesting to see the impact that has on the game.

02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:49.500
I think it's going to kill it.

02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:52.900
I think it has those diehard fans that still support it but now that they're going to ask

02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:55.800
money out of pocket every month, that's going to be rough.

02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:57.300
I know I won't pay for it.

02:34:57.300 --> 02:35:02.700
I'll go back and check it out when version 2 launches or if there's some huge content

02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:06.220
upgrade but yeah, I think Zethur summed it up in chat.

02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:08.940
Well, there it goes Final Fantasy XIV.

02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:10.740
Bye bye.

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:13.300
Nice knowing you.

02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:19.060
Let's go to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:22.260
I'm going to check the Twitter too to see if we have any tweets.

02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:25.660
I forgot to ask for those earlier because I was so involved in the Mario Kart thing

02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:31.060
earlier but I'll look for those if I can find them amongst the new Twitter because they've

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:34.020
changed the look of Twitter again.

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:35.220
Why?

02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:36.220
Because they can.

02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:38.220
Although I will say it's not terrible.

02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:42.420
Alright, let's go to the Skype line.

02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:45.860
Meanwhile while we wait for the Skype line, Loki, do we have last minute stories?

02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:48.580
I'm sure there's got to be a few tonight because I think there were some big things I skipped

02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:49.580
over, right?

02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:50.580
Umm, maybe.

02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:58.020
I didn't look them up so I'm trying to think here if there's anything really major that

02:35:58.020 --> 02:35:59.540
I can think of off the top of my head.

02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:01.380
Well, I have a couple tweets while you're looking alright.

02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:02.380
Alright, sounds good.

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:09.660
Mishiro Chan, Mishiro Chan or Gamer Girl says, I just picked up the Oregon Trail game for

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.540
the Wii and it's pretty fun.

02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:14.260
I'm working on doing a write up to post on site.

02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:15.260
Awesome.

02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:16.260
I would like to hear more about it.

02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:18.320
I hope it's better than the Facebook one, that's for sure.

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.800
I think it looks, well, I think it looks very similar to the Facebook and the phone version

02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:23.800
that they add out.

02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:28.100
In fact, I would be surprised if it wasn't the exact same.

02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:30.420
I hope it will not die of dysentery.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:35.460
Umm, YYR tweets us saying, remember, boom!

02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:36.700
And sends us a YouTube link.

02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:41.460
Usually I don't play YouTube links on the show but I'm hoping that it's a link from

02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:44.620
umm, uhh, Bungee Ferret Cat.

02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:47.820
Oh no, this is from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:48.820
Cliff.

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:49.820
Amprecias.

02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:52.580
Oh, I love these.

02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:56.300
Mysterious Sepro lecture number three.

02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:00.580
I've just mastered the skill known as the pulverizing bash.

02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:02.080
Indeed.

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:07.980
By running to increase your speed, the power to throw yourselves increases as well.

02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:13.220
You can destroy places with weak foundations or small cracks with incredible ease.

02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:20.180
But, be sure to give yourself plenty of room to run so you can increase your speed.

02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:21.180
That's right.

02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:24.260
Make a good approach, start running and then boom!

02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:27.380
That's all for today.

02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:28.380
Yeah.

02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:29.380
Let's go to the phones.

02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:30.380
I love the voice acting in that game.

02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.380
And then boom!

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.380
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:33.380
Who's this?

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:34.380
Hey, it's Zether from the chat.

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:35.380
Hi.

02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:36.380
Zether from the chat.

02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.380
What's on your mind?

02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:38.380
Oh, not much.

02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:42.460
I enjoyed playing Mario Kart with you guys, it was pretty fun.

02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:44.780
I know, Mario Kart's an awesome game.

02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:45.780
Yeah.

02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:52.380
Umm, well yesterday I recently beat umm, well yesterday I beat umm, Snatcher yesterday.

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:53.380
It was really fun.

02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:54.380
Freakin' love Snatcher.

02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:56.380
Gosh, that's old school.

02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:57.380
Nice.

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:02.380
Yeah, it's, I, I didn't think I would be able to finish it, like to finish all of it, but

02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:07.060
I finished like the second, by the time you finish the second act, the game pretty much

02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:13.140
becomes like, pretty much just goes automatically for you, but there is this one final shooting

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:17.100
segment that's actually very difficult.

02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:24.140
It was the umm, the super Insector things, and they start like swarming around the screen.

02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:29.000
And then umm, I kept dying repeatedly at that part, and then umm, it came up to the, then

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.420
I didn't realize that there was a second part where you had to shoot Snatchers, and I died

02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:38.560
during that, and it kicks you back to the first part again with the Insectors, so it's

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.880
a little annoying having to keep doing it over and over.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.480
But I beat it, it was pretty good.

02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:48.360
It's always a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a game.

02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:52.620
It's one I haven't felt in a long time because I have such gamer ADD I never finish anything.

02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:58.620
Yeah, I, I actually did finish umm, Saints Row the Third a couple, like a month ago I

02:38:58.620 --> 02:38:59.620
think.

02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:01.300
Now what'd you think of Saints Row the Third?

02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:03.920
Cuz I just played it for the first time this week.

02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:05.660
I think it was really good.

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:12.240
It was pretty over the top, insane, definitely, I, I preordered it on Steam, full price, and

02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:14.440
I, I definitely got what I paid for.

02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:15.880
It was really good.

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:16.880
Nice.

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:20.640
It's, I love, I love how over the top it is, what kind, did you make, did you try to make

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.840
a character who was kinda like you, or did you make a character who was over the top

02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:25.840
too?

02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:31.120
I actually downloaded a character from the umm, from like the online thing.

02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:35.640
They had a guy who looked like Gabe Newell, so I used him for the whole game.

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:36.640
Nice.

02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:41.280
And it was hilarious just seeing this guy running, who looks like Gabe Newell running

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:45.440
around like being all snarky and blowing stuff up.

02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:53.320
It's like, oh, oh wow, Gabe Newell's blowing up a helicopter, now he's killing these furries

02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:55.320
in this umm, game show.

02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.240
That sounds like something Gabe Newell might actually do.

02:39:58.240 --> 02:39:59.760
Yeah.

02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:00.760
It was pretty good.

02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:01.760
Awesome.

02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:04.280
Well it sounds like I've barely scratched the surface of the game.

02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:05.280
Furries on a game show?

02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.920
I haven't come across this yet, so it sounds pretty awesome.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.080
Yeah, it's the umm, it's one of the side missions you play in umm, Genki's little

02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:13.760
ridiculous game show thing.

02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:18.440
I keep doing the missions like one after another, should I just say screw it and kind of drive

02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:19.440
around and look for stuff first?

02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:24.320
No, because they're gonna take you through those, all the like uhh, diversions basically

02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:28.600
by actually playing the missions because they kind of, it goes through the whole tutorial

02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:32.280
mode a little long, but it's good because you've never played any of the games, so you

02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:35.920
know, you don't know how to play insurance fraud or anything like that.

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:36.920
Right, right.

02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:42.360
So umm, but they'll take you through like the Genki show and Tiger Escort and stuff

02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:43.360
like that.

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:44.360
Oh yeah, that one's good.

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:45.360
I can only imagine.

02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:46.640
The tank one is the best.

02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:51.400
I think the tank one where you have to rack up the most umm, money and damage is the best

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:56.840
because you can literally just go through, just keep pressing forward, holding down both,

02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:01.720
holding down both fire buttons for the minigun and the main cannon, you can pretty much just

02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:03.320
keep racking up the points.

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:04.320
It's all about the fences.

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:09.160
No, my, my favorite thing so far has been the little computer that my chick picked up

02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.080
and she can use it to just fire guided missiles at tanks on a whim.

02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:19.760
Oh yeah, that's awesome, the umm, it's kind of like a umm, missile launch, yeah the missile

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:20.760
drop thing.

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.040
Yeah, it's like a little computer you use to launch missiles and I guess it's like a

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:27.160
regular weapon you can use to just launch guided missiles at your foes.

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:28.960
That's pretty impressive.

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:32.880
And I gotta say the environments, like I love the whole like downtown LA looking environment

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:37.760
is, it's very neon and I love purple so I'm glad it's the ganks color.

02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:41.640
Just wait until you get to the Tron world, the Tron world is amazing.

02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:44.800
I'm sure I'll have a huge boner over to the Tron world because I love Tron.

02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:48.920
Yeah, it's pretty awesome, I was enjoying like every minute of it.

02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:49.920
Awesome, awesome.

02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:54.200
Alright well Zethyr, any other final thoughts to get out there before we let you go?

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:58.920
Not much, I finished Snatcher and I'm actually playing the MSX version like the, because

02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.160
somebody translated it.

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:01.160
Old school Snatcher.

02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:06.600
Yeah, even older than the Sega CD one so, and then I'm probably gonna go play Policenauts

02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.080
which is the follow up of sorts and it got translated to you.

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:14.440
I have Policenauts on Playstation.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:15.440
Check out the original Metal Gear.

02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:18.000
Yeah, it's the one that got translated actually.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.800
And the real Metal Gear 2 that's on MSX.

02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:24.000
Well no, I mean I've got it in Japanese and it was a pain in the butt trying to play through

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.000
it in Japanese.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Oh yeah it is.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Yeah.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Lots of text.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.600
Alright well Zethyr, enjoy your Kojima-thon, okay?

02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:31.600
Alright.

02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:32.600
Alright, later.

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:33.600
Later.

02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.720
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, AkumaJP in chat says, human rights for furries

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:39.720
too.

02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:42.960
Well you know what, if I'm not mistaken, you could make your character a furry and you

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:44.880
could just revenge of the furries.

02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:48.800
So if you want to blow everything up as a furry, you have every right to do so and you

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:53.520
could lead this notorious gang of criminals if you want that everybody stops and asks

02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:54.920
for the autograph.

02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:58.600
So like, I just remember in the very beginning of the game, some girl asked for some guy's

02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:01.680
autograph and then I walked up and she didn't want my autograph so I shot her.

02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:05.800
I was like, how rude, bang.

02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:08.240
Game makes me sound like a terrible person but it's really fun.

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:11.600
That's because you are a terrible person, heart.

02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:12.600
Hey!

02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:14.000
I'll shoot you too.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.160
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:18.160
Alright.

02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:21.160
More last minute stories-ish things going on over there.

02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:25.760
Yeah they announced that the VGAs that they're doing, Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, it's gonna

02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:30.960
blend I guess the first two Tony Hawk titles and be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and

02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:33.120
PlayStation Network next year.

02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:35.520
Gosh, the recent Tony Hawk games haven't been selling.

02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:36.960
How can we get the game to sell again?

02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:39.720
I know, let's go back to when the games did sell.

02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:42.880
You know what, that's not a bad idea and it looked pretty good based on the trailer.

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.000
I liked Pro Skater, I thought that was pretty awesome so I would look forward to playing

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000
this actually.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Alright, let's go to another call.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
It's Legend of Zaku here.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Zaku, what's up?

02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.040
Nothing much, just kicking back, making sure I stay calm and sane before tomorrow's work

02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:01.040
week.

02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:02.040
Well good luck.

02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:06.040
But yeah, it's been a while since I called, so I got through actually.

02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:07.040
It's been a little while.

02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:08.040
What have you been playing?

02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:09.040
What's new?

02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:15.480
Let's see, Forza 4 having to tackle the wireless steering wheel that Microsoft released for

02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:18.000
the 360.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:25.880
But all in all it's been mostly that and just playing my PC, but nothing new on that end.

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.840
Do you use head tracking in Forza 4 at all?

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:28.840
Do you have Kinect?

02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.840
I don't have a Kinect.

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:31.480
I don't have enough space in my room for a Kinect.

02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.740
You could get one of those little Zoom things, but I kind of bought one and it kind of sucks

02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:36.740
for me.

02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:37.740
I didn't like it.

02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:40.400
It's smaller than the dorm rooms I was in in college.

02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:42.320
Well, you do live in New York City.

02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:45.160
Yeah, but it's a house.

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:52.640
Anyways, I noticed yesterday, I know it's almost like gaming related, but one of the

02:44:52.640 --> 02:45:01.160
best DDR freestylers in the country, you know, frequency, I know him in real life.

02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:05.520
He had his little going away party yesterday and pretty much all the old school DDR players

02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:06.520
came out.

02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:07.520
Where's he going to?

02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:11.160
Moving back to Long Island.

02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.760
So yeah, that was pretty much me just getting drunk.

02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:20.800
I think I should have gotten a DDR dollar bill into the mix, but I didn't even notify

02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:21.800
him.

02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:22.800
Oh.

02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:26.120
How rude of us.

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:30.160
But anyways, shifting on real quick.

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:35.920
Video game awards were yesterday and I noticed that Battlefield 3 got shafted.

02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:40.320
It came empty handed.

02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.880
The way I see it is that the winners were pretty much like, I know they're picked by

02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:50.760
the people, but boy do they have like, aside from Skyrim and Uncharted and Arkham actually

02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:57.240
getting the words they deserve, they actually had the gall to put Modern Warfare 3, you

02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.760
know, put them up on the pedestal for anything.

02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:04.840
It's well, without getting into the whole Modern Warfare versus Battlefield thing, because

02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:08.960
honestly I have no authority whatsoever to speak on that subject.

02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:14.500
But just in general, it's a tough year for game awards and all that because there's so

02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:15.880
much good shit this year.

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:18.080
It has really been a great year for games.

02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:19.080
As it should be.

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:21.280
I mean, the systems have been out how long?

02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:24.160
This is the years where they're really perfecting these systems.

02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:27.840
I expect that next year should kick a lot of ass, too.

02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:29.840
I mean, yeah, you're right.

02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:32.880
Mass Effect 3 is like, what, a month away from now?

02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:33.880
That's right.

02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:35.800
Yeah, those games aren't afraid to release in January.

02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:37.840
Yeah, of course.

02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:42.480
They have very little competition for movies since that's a dumping ground for those films

02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:43.480
anyways.

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:47.400
Yeah, it's a smart time to release a game.

02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:53.800
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yeah, this was a pretty good year for video gaming,

02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:54.800
you know, in recent memory.

02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:57.240
Oh yeah, pretty much so.

02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:04.080
And hopefully next year, whatever they release, whatever they come out with, at that point

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:08.520
they're gonna start, you know, I'm more concerned about Nintendo.

02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:12.640
Like they better start pulling rabbits out of their hat to replace their aging Wii.

02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:14.480
Well, Wii U next year.

02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:15.480
And now it's...

02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.600
Yeah, if they can pull it off, if the rumors aren't true that their dev units are even,

02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:22.760
are just like, not even up to par yet.

02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:27.840
Well, keep in mind too, 3DS, thanks to the two strong releases, has gained a lot of steam,

02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.320
which you know, I think we all saw coming.

02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.760
Like you know, we knew they had to pull it out this holiday season and I think they've

02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:36.480
succeeded to an extent with the two big releases.

02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.960
I don't know what the final word is on how much it's sold, but I think they're saying

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:43.640
already it sold more than the DS did in its first year.

02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:49.280
Now granted, it's a little bit apple to oranges because, you know, the 3DS should have the

02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:56.360
DS's inertia to piggyback on, but you know, I think all in all, the 3DS is not going away

02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:57.680
anytime soon.

02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:03.220
Right, and then obviously it still has to contend with the Vita and then all the new

02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:05.840
powerful smartphones are coming out within the next year.

02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:08.760
I kind of think there's room for both the 3DS and the Vita.

02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:12.240
I don't think they're going to bite from each other that much.

02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.540
What about the third one, the mobile game market?

02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:20.600
The fact that the smartphones out there are pretty much not only matching, but exceeding

02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.120
their specs.

02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:33.600
I have yet to play a game on a cell phone that also exists on a 3DS or Vita or any handheld

02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:35.440
system that outshines it.

02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:41.680
I wonder if Angry Birds would count since they already have it on PSP.

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:43.400
I'm not big on Angry Birds.

02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:46.760
It's not to say mobile phone games are bad because there's a lot of good ones out there,

02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:51.560
but most mobile phone games are kind of developed for mobile phones and they kind of, like,

02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:57.040
the handheld game and mobile phones are kind of two separate worlds for me, but I get how

02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.440
the two can cannibalize from each other as well.

02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:03.320
I get how mobile phone is kicking Nintendo in the pants a little bit.

02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:05.600
Why do you think they're...

02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:10.440
Because Angry Birds is 99 cents and Mario Kart's 40.

02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:15.120
I mean, alright, on one hand you have a system that's basically, you're right, it's touch

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:16.120
screen.

02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:22.240
It's the best thing for hardcore gamers, but at the end of the day, they have, you know,

02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:27.440
the platforms that they're running on, not only iPhone and Android, they're just, like,

02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:31.000
they're getting out these systems for about the same price, but it's something that you're

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.420
going to carry with every day and going to use in an emergency, in addition to just playing

02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:38.680
Angry Birds or any other, you know, game right now.

02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:44.840
Like, even me, for example, I bought, like, SimCity for 10 cents today from the Android

02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:48.320
market when they had that little sale, and I actually, I'm kicking myself because I missed

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.000
out on Minecraft earlier last week.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.680
Mirror's Edge was free on iOS this weekend, by the way.

02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:00.480
I don't know if it still is, I grabbed it when it was, so yay me.

02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.720
But it's like, there are certain games I would play on the Android market, it's just a matter

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:13.000
of like, the ones that I'm willing to shell out money for, and those are pretty much like,

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000
they're rare.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.120
Like, from Angry Birds and Tap Tap, it's like, if they had something like SimCity or maybe

02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:26.000
like a strategy game where you move around units, not like a castle defense game, but

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.680
something where you're just like, like a Starcraft or a Command and Conquer clone, then I could

02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:34.000
definitely see myself playing that on the subways.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.000
All right.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.920
All right, well, Zaku, I gotta wrap up, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your

02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:39.920
call.

02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:40.920
Yeah, definitely.

02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:41.920
All right, take care, buddy.

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:42.920
Have a good night.

02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:43.920
You too.

02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:47.400
I'm gonna do it for the phone lines tonight, because we're well after midnight on the East

02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:50.320
Coast now, so I think we need to wrap up the show, so sorry to those who didn't get through,

02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:54.800
but please consider sending us an email, make DarkSakura work for next week.

02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:57.560
Hey, I work really hard all the time.

02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:02.960
One eight, it's, excuse me, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com.

02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:07.040
Quickly with these last few tweets, and then Loki left the room for a minute, but we'll

02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:11.920
get him to do the last few last minute stories.

02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:17.560
Tigerclaw wanted to send us a link that talks about layoffs at THQ's uDraw division.

02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:20.440
Yep, it looks like some layoffs have happened over there.

02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:25.440
30 employees were laid off on Friday, and layoffs are never good news, but at the same

02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:29.120
time, it sounds like they might have put too many eggs in the basket of uDraw, because

02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:33.560
I think it was, like, doing really well at first, but it's really funny.

02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:35.320
I went to a family event today.

02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:41.240
My grandma's 95th birthday was today, so happy birthday to my grandma, of course, but some

02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:45.400
of my family was there, including, like, you know, some people that don't play a lot of

02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:48.600
games, but like families, you know, they're like, they don't really watch a lot of TV,

02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:52.600
but they're like, yeah, we own a Wii, and they actually mentioned, she actually said,

02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:58.240
oh, we just bought last Christmas this uDraw tablet, but we never play it, so it's kind

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:02.720
of one of those, you know, oops, the inertia wasn't strong enough to keep the uDraw thing

02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:08.400
going, so, ouch, yep, so there it went, goodbye.

02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:15.520
And from Rama tweets us, on the hooves of the popular cartoon, we have My Little Pony

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:16.880
Fighting is Magic.

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:21.200
I don't know how I feel about your My Little Pony obsession these days, but sure enough,

02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:27.200
at main6.com, they have this little trailer for My Little Pony Fighting Game.

02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:36.040
You know what, I used to watch the original My Little Pony.

02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:38.440
These new ones just look derpy.

02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:41.080
Well, they do have a character named Derpy, actually.

02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:43.720
Yeah, but I mean, everyone looks derpy.

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:48.960
All right, one more tweet, I'm gonna sneak in one more tweet here from Ziba.

02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:54.000
I like Ziba, and she's psychic, because she knew from my teaser tweets, she knew about

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.960
the whole Umlaut thing, she guessed it.

02:52:55.960 --> 02:53:00.200
Ziba says, O-L-R, I recently downloaded Snoopy Street Fair on the App Store.

02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:01.200
It's really fun.

02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.560
If you are a Snoopy or Peanuts fan, get it.

02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:04.560
I like Snoopy.

02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:08.440
I wonder if it's like an action-y game or a puzzle game, I'll have to find out more

02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:09.880
about it.

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:12.800
So there you go, that's gonna do it for tweets tonight, let's see if there's any other last

02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:13.800
minute stories.

02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:14.800
Loki?

02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:20.400
Uh, yeah, there's actually one thing here, well, a couple things.

02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:26.880
First off, Q Entertainment has revealed 99 Nights Online.

02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:33.760
So if you want a game that's kind of like, it's not exactly like 99 Nights, the regular

02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:43.080
one that's sort of like a Dynasty Warriors knockoff almost, but this is a 2D action MMO.

02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:46.300
It's interesting that this game refuses to go anywhere, yet we have such a hard time

02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:48.240
getting Xenoblade over here, just saying.

02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:54.000
It looks very much like, I don't know, like a lot of the 2D games that come over from

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.520
like Vanillaware and stuff like that, Neat, I guess, I don't know if that's actually coming

02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:04.460
out over here though, I think that's only in Japan, but pretty cool.

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:15.960
And then, I mean, this is just annoying, but apparently there's been a quote from Capcom,

02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:22.760
Christian Svensson, who is the Vice President of Strategic Planning and Marketing Development,

02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:32.320
of course, commenting on Mega Man Legends 3, saying that, you know, what was the actual

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:41.560
quote here, that Mega Man is still a key brand for them, and that, you know, I guess basically

02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:50.640
promising that there are fans that, no, there will be a Mega Man game possibly coming out.

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.240
They're considering Mega Man's future, so...

02:54:54.240 --> 02:55:00.520
How nice of you to give it some thought, to take pittance on us commoners, to allow us

02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:02.480
an audience with the king.

02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:06.360
We're considering it, even though there's this big fan campaign to get another game,

02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:09.880
we're considering, you know, being nice and giving you...

02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:12.920
How bad do you want it, boys?

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:19.560
Seriously, and with that, as much as Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome, I can't support

02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:23.800
that kind of thing, so I don't know if I'd buy it.

02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:25.480
I don't know.

02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:26.480
And then...

02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:30.680
It's a shame how that has all been ruined, but anyway.

02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:36.880
Now, I'm sure you're aware of Just Dance and how it's a popular franchise, and a lot of

02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:41.760
these smaller developers out there like to, you know, knock off this game and put out

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:44.000
their own dancing game.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:50.840
So one of these companies, Oxygen Games, I believe, or OG International, which sounds

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:57.920
a little bit funnier, they have a game called Get Up and Dance, and it's really hilarious.

02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:06.560
Actually, I got to show you, I forgot to pull up the other screenshot, but basically, the

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:11.880
game looks almost exactly, I mean, straight down to the art style like Just Dance 3.

02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:17.920
But anyways, there was this court case from Ubisoft suing the company, saying that, you

02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:25.480
know, you guys can't release this because this is violating copyright, and basically

02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:28.720
you're just creating a game that's exactly the same as ours.

02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:30.560
And apparently, though, the judge...

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:33.560
Wait, wait, did you say the game is called Get Up and Dance?

02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:34.560
Get Up and Dance.

02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:35.880
Because there's a total Bimani joke in there.

02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.880
Did you get it?

02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:52.760
Anyway, so the court, though, has allowed, because Ubisoft, one of the things they wanted

02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:58.440
to do was put a temporary restraining order on the publisher to not be able to put this

02:56:58.440 --> 02:56:59.440
game out.

02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.040
So they have been denied.

02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:06.240
Ubisoft cannot restrain the release of this game.

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:09.880
It's supposed to be published in North America on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:13.560
Of course, you know, the PlayStation 3 being the move version.

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:18.960
But yes, the game looks exactly, I mean, straight down to the artwork exactly like Just Dance.

02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:25.160
Of course, it will not sell as well as Just Dance.

02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:31.120
Alright, that's it for last minute stories.

02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.640
Alright, like, there's at least three people who get the joke.

02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:37.840
At least, I can count at least three people in chat who should understand that joke.

02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:38.840
At least.

02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:39.840
Alright.

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:44.680
Anyhow, that's going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:46.080
Aw, sad face.

02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:49.960
Alright, but thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:50.960
We really appreciate it.

02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:51.960
We appreciate the support.

02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:52.960
We do.

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:53.960
We're com...

02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:54.960
Yes, we do.

02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:55.960
Girl.

02:57:55.960 --> 02:57:57.040
We're commercial free.

02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:58.040
We appreciate it.

02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:01.220
All we ask, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:02.960
Help us spread through word of mouth.

02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:04.920
We really appreciate it.

02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:07.800
Now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:09.000
Dark Soccer, we'll start you tonight.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Your final thought.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:15.080
Um, I really have an obsession with fab.com lately, but I can't afford anything there

02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:18.000
except for my Helveta cards.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.880
My final thought is, um, I won at least one piece of tier 13 Looking for Raid by this

02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:25.280
time next week.

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:27.320
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.120
My final thought is I've been looking for some good cage match songs and I found one.

02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:34.560
All right, that's going to do it.

02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:36.280
Thank you guys once again for listening to our show.

02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:39.080
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:42.200
Have a wonderful night, everybody, and thanks for listening.

02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:43.200
