Tonight, December 18th, 2011, Square Enix experiences a hack, Nintendo offers free games

00:20.080 --> 00:29.920
for loyalty points, and the PlayStation Vita appears to abandon the instruction manual.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.860
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.860 --> 00:41.960
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with the 439th episode

00:41.960 --> 00:50.080
of our show on this December the 18th of 2011. We're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

00:50.080 --> 00:54.520
where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

00:54.520 --> 00:58.200
after the Bobby Blackall show. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the

00:58.200 --> 01:02.940
next few hours to talk about video games, gamer culture, gamer lifestyle, and so forth

01:02.940 --> 01:09.920
with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. You're like that video of Rick

01:09.920 --> 01:15.920
Perry where they replaced him with a butt. That one was great. How are you? I'm okay.

01:15.920 --> 01:24.160
Yeah? It's been a long day. It's been a long day. Been packing up stuff. Mm-hmm. Been...

01:24.160 --> 01:29.640
big changes coming. Preparing to abandon ship. Yeah, there's some big changes coming. We're

01:29.640 --> 01:33.760
saying goodbye tonight, so we'll come back to that in a minute. Yeah. So let's also go

01:33.760 --> 01:38.640
to the one and only Techmaster, Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? Fine. I see you brought

01:38.640 --> 01:43.240
your 3DS tonight. Yes, I did. And I brought my 3DS. You know what that means? Mario Kart

01:43.240 --> 01:48.200
Break Time! Hell yes! So live listeners, get your 3DSs because we're going to try and do

01:48.200 --> 01:53.160
at least one track, if not two, of Mario Kart during the break tonight, so be ready for

01:53.160 --> 01:58.440
it. The official OLRME 3DS code. It's on Twitter. It's on our forums too over at orangelawnsradio.com,

01:58.440 --> 02:02.680
and I'm sure it will be pasted in chat momentarily. Tiger Claw will have it pasted there in three

02:02.680 --> 02:07.640
seconds. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to join our chat room, of course, and

02:07.640 --> 02:13.440
talk with us there. All right. In fact, Jim Salley is in our chat room tonight starting

02:13.440 --> 02:18.440
us off talking about the intro to the show, saying, Jim Salley, OLR's intro is great.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.120
It always pumps me up. It is a great little song. That was by Midihead. If you don't know

02:23.120 --> 02:27.600
who did our intro, his name is Midihead. He did some of the songs in DDR, Beatmania, kind

02:27.600 --> 02:32.280
of like around when the Xbox version, original Xbox versions were big. He's a great guy.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.240
We had him on the show. And then Jim Salley says, then Rob's soothing voice brings me

02:36.240 --> 02:41.680
down and I get all snuggly in bed. Not sure how to take that, but all right, sure. Whatever

02:41.680 --> 02:48.480
floats your boat. Whatever gets you to listen live with us. Anyhow, so usually we start

02:48.480 --> 02:51.880
off the show with how is your gaming week, so I think we'll get into that and then we'll

02:51.880 --> 02:54.280
come back to the housekeeping thing we want to talk about. So let's talk about our gaming

02:54.280 --> 03:01.040
weeks. DarkSakura, how was your gaming week? I played shit. I really haven't done a whole

03:01.040 --> 03:06.040
bunch of console stuff just because we've been packing up stuff. More coming later.

03:06.040 --> 03:12.820
We do have the GameCube out so that we could play the Game Boy Advance player. So we had

03:12.820 --> 03:22.360
some run-throughs of the Final Fight that's on there and I played some P.O.P.O. and I

03:22.360 --> 03:26.720
think Dan played some Metroid Fusion. But I mean we were just bopping through a few

03:26.720 --> 03:29.720
games here and there. It's like Game Boy Advance made a comeback this week between that and

03:29.720 --> 03:35.600
the 3DS news, which I know is coming up later, but everybody knows those games came out.

03:35.600 --> 03:42.960
So we actually put the Saturn up because we're tired of Christmas nights. Oh well. Christmas

03:42.960 --> 03:51.320
is cancelled. Da da da, da da da, I don't care to play this anymore. No other holiday

03:51.320 --> 03:55.960
games to get you in the mood? Um, no. You don't want to dance to Silent Hill in D.R.?

03:55.960 --> 04:01.760
Wow. Wow? Winter Veil? I've been doing stupid Winter Veil shit. No, finally, thank you Shane

04:01.760 --> 04:07.240
for making me an orc DK so I can throw snowflakes at you. I don't even know if he's listening.

04:07.240 --> 04:13.120
If you're listening. If you're not. There's Rick Perry again. He made a drawn-eye priest

04:13.120 --> 04:20.560
for me to throw snowflakes at named poor Jamie. I think when I, and just so people know, like

04:20.560 --> 04:24.280
what this is, there's certain achievements in WoW where you have to find characters of

04:24.280 --> 04:28.800
a certain, like around the holidays, like for instance the Easter one or whatever they

04:28.800 --> 04:34.440
call Easter in WoW, I can't remember. Noble Garden. Noble Garden, that's it. You have

04:34.440 --> 04:41.780
to find female characters of each race level eighteen or over and it's called Shake Your

04:41.780 --> 04:45.560
Bunny Maker. And you have to turn them into bunnies. And they have to be level eighteen

04:45.560 --> 04:49.400
or older. I can tell you this because I'm a female dwarf which is like a freaking unicorn

04:49.400 --> 04:53.920
in WoW and I can't tell you how much I get turned into a freaking bunny when that holiday

04:53.920 --> 05:00.720
comes around. Freaking goats are easy to find. So I made a rogue for whatever the last holiday

05:00.720 --> 05:03.920
was. You had to do something with a blood elf rogue. I don't remember why I did it,

05:03.920 --> 05:09.360
but I did. And I named it Oops I Pooped. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that one. You made it for

05:09.360 --> 05:13.200
me to find. Cause I still haven't deleted it. I thought you had a troll. I did, but

05:13.200 --> 05:16.280
I deleted the troll so I could make the rogue. No, that's right. Cause I had to go, I had

05:16.280 --> 05:23.280
to go run to you. Yeah. Stupid silver moon. Um, but yeah, so I've actually been playing

05:23.280 --> 05:27.960
Peggle in WoW too now that it works again. Nice. But right now the thing that I'm trying

05:27.960 --> 05:34.640
to get is I have to kill ten more people while dressed as a gnome in a, uh, Santa costume.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.720
Oh yeah. I don't like how it kind of forces you to do PVP if you want to get all the achievements.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.440
I know. And then like you get killed and you don't and you lose the disguise. All I have

05:43.440 --> 05:48.960
to say when that stupid kids holiday comes up, you are going to want to kill, kill something.

05:48.960 --> 05:55.000
I mean it's just, I actually, I want to do BB King. That's, that's not too bad. BB King

05:55.000 --> 06:00.440
is where you go to, to the major hoard cities and you have to shoot the leaders with a BB

06:00.440 --> 06:05.880
gun. Like, like I'm going to go shoot Sylvanus in the ass or something. Anyway, I saved the

06:05.880 --> 06:11.920
WoW talk for the other show. Hoardhouse.com. Well have me back on. We might. Episode 50

06:11.920 --> 06:16.000
is coming up very soon. When? I just have to convince Extrofer we should tape more often

06:16.000 --> 06:20.080
than every other week. But that's another, that's another story. Well, um, I also got

06:20.080 --> 06:24.880
some games on steam cause I got the humble indie bundle thanks to Rob and I started cave

06:24.880 --> 06:29.080
story and then Dan's like, I was like, I'm kind of tired of playing cause we've had a

06:29.080 --> 06:34.400
busy day. Dance like, Oh, play more. So he's watching me play cave story. That doesn't

06:34.400 --> 06:38.980
usually happen. Usually you're watching him play stuff. So he's like, he gave, okay, check

06:38.980 --> 06:45.980
out this elder thing. Rob. Nice. My old school game pad controller. You should put a picture

06:45.980 --> 06:50.320
of that on olr.com. I might. It's actually not the one. It's not the one that I used

06:50.320 --> 06:54.800
when I played. What brand is that? Is that like a gravis gravis? It's not the one that

06:54.800 --> 07:00.360
I used when I played a final fantasy 11 in my, the older one that kind of to me looks

07:00.360 --> 07:04.680
like what the PlayStation three controller was going to look like. Like it kind of has

07:04.680 --> 07:10.200
that boomerang thing going on a little bit, just a little bit, but it's not quite as tacky

07:10.200 --> 07:14.480
as that other controller was. It's actually fairly comfortable. I mean, cause you know,

07:14.480 --> 07:19.640
my hands all fucked up. Yeah. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm kind of high. The pro you

07:19.640 --> 07:28.640
are, I had had half a beer and I've been allergies all day. So cause all the dust we've kicked

07:28.640 --> 07:34.880
up. So yeah. Um, I played cave story and then I got another game just randomly. I happened

07:34.880 --> 07:40.280
to see it up on steam and I was like, that was kind of pretty. I'm going to get it cause

07:40.280 --> 07:46.200
it's pretty. It was a game called fractal that you have to, um, you have these little

07:46.200 --> 07:55.080
hexagon shapes on and for those who don't know their roots, hexagons are six sided polyhedrons.

07:55.080 --> 08:01.920
What's a polyhedron? Your butt. Um, so you have to form, attach something of the same

08:01.920 --> 08:09.440
color to all sides of it and then it'll explode. But you have a push. So say you have to push

08:09.440 --> 08:14.640
in the spaces around them and you get a certain color that you'll push with and like say that

08:14.640 --> 08:19.080
you're only on one side. We only push in one side, but say that you push in the dead center

08:19.080 --> 08:24.880
of a circle of them, it'll push them all out all in that color. So you have to make the

08:24.880 --> 08:30.440
little all six sides of one touch and sometimes you can get multiple, they're called blooms

08:30.440 --> 08:34.000
and you see you get point multipliers and you also get little ones that if you hit them,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.380
they destroy everything around them and all this stuff. But it's really hard. Like I'm

08:37.380 --> 08:45.880
only on the 10th stage and there's a bunch of them and you have to get like 320 breaks

08:45.880 --> 08:51.800
done and like the most I can get is 240. It's tough. But you were telling me the music kind

08:51.800 --> 08:56.800
of adds to the game, right? The music is very trancey. It's very ambient trance. And, um,

08:56.800 --> 09:02.620
as you do better, as your score goes up in that level, it's like, like for example, when

09:02.620 --> 09:09.280
you break one blossom, that's seven points. If you get like a double, you get 14 awesome

09:09.280 --> 09:18.800
blossom. If you get anyway, um, what was I saying? Oh yeah. So you get the, as you get

09:18.800 --> 09:23.320
more points, the music gets more complex. But when you run out of pushes, like when

09:23.320 --> 09:30.580
you get down to like five pushes, the music starts going really slow and it doesn't change

09:30.580 --> 09:38.840
in pitch. It just changes in tempo. So it's just like, you know, really slow. And then

09:38.840 --> 09:45.200
you're on your last push and then it just stops. And one thing that I really like about

09:45.200 --> 09:50.760
is actually the type design in this game. It's really pretty. Of course. Well, it like

09:50.760 --> 09:55.540
your, your levels come out on a diagonal. Um, your, when it gives you all your level

09:55.540 --> 10:01.560
information and your scores, like I'll try to go in and do a screen cap of a level so

10:01.560 --> 10:07.680
that I can show people what it looks like, but it's really gorgeous game. And like when

10:07.680 --> 10:13.200
you choose your graphics settings, you have like good, bad, but when you start going better,

10:13.200 --> 10:18.520
you have beautiful, you know, so it's pretty cool. And it starts off asking if you want

10:18.520 --> 10:24.200
to play it windowed. Cause you look pretty from the two seconds I saw you playing it.

10:24.200 --> 10:31.560
Yeah. Um, I'll uh, I'll put some screen caps. It's like it's six bucks right now on steam.

10:31.560 --> 10:36.520
So go, go get it. All of you go get it so that they'll make more and maybe they'll make

10:36.520 --> 10:42.240
a tutorial so that it's not so freaking hard. It's one of those games that's so hard that

10:42.240 --> 10:48.000
it pisses you off until you have to beat it. I'm so mad. I will conquer you. All right.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.800
You, you whore going on to a Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, it was okay. I played

10:54.800 --> 11:04.640
a lot of Skyrim. Um, been exploiting the Dawn star, uh, hidden Khajiit treasure chest. Um,

11:04.640 --> 11:09.040
actually did that for quite a bit last night. It's very rewarding because you get a lot

11:09.040 --> 11:16.600
of loot and money and you get to kill somebody in their face over and over and over again.

11:16.600 --> 11:22.960
So I like that phrase, kill someone in their face. Yep. You win the award of choice of

11:22.960 --> 11:30.120
words today. Um, and then, uh, so I spent last night trying to take all the loot that

11:30.120 --> 11:39.760
I got from Dawn star back to, um, uh, winter hold and what else did I do? Oh yeah. And

11:39.760 --> 11:45.240
then, um, a little bit more in the quest of, uh, a night to remember, which is funny because

11:45.240 --> 11:51.540
it's like a, this big long chain of random things that you did while you were drunk one

11:51.540 --> 11:58.320
night cause you blacked out and can't remember. So it was kind of fun. And then I got a Mario

11:58.320 --> 12:02.460
kart seven and Mario or super Mario three D land for the three DS this week. So I played

12:02.460 --> 12:07.280
lots of Mario kart seven. I finished all the tracks, um, where all the circuits, I guess,

12:07.280 --> 12:16.200
in a 50 CC and I started to play some one 50 CC stuff, but man, I mean, seriously, Nintendo,

12:16.200 --> 12:20.960
I understand you got to ramp up the difficulty for one 50 CC, but the rubber band AI is just

12:20.960 --> 12:28.320
so retarded. It's just ridiculous. The amount of it's like, do I really need to be hit with

12:28.320 --> 12:33.000
like two blue shells, five red shells and you know, lightning all at the same time.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, and thank you for doing lightning right as I'm jumping over a cliff. It's like I'm

12:37.000 --> 12:43.040
playing with fucking assholes in, you know, Mario kart seven. I mean, it's just the computer's

12:43.040 --> 12:47.920
like, ha, suck it bitch. You're over it. You're in the worst spot possible for a lightning

12:47.920 --> 12:52.800
bolt and lightning bolt. That's what you're going to get. It's like, I hate that too.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.680
They just, they always seem to know right when you're going over like a big jump and

12:55.680 --> 12:58.960
that's when they're going to hit the lightning bolt or right before you get there. It's just,

12:58.960 --> 13:02.680
that's irritating. You know, it's like, I can be way ahead of everybody else. And you

13:02.680 --> 13:08.800
know, here comes Mario. It's like, Oh, I'm sorry. Mario got like five, uh, five superstars

13:08.800 --> 13:14.160
in a infinite boost all at the same time. Oh, and he's a dragon. It flies now for some

13:14.160 --> 13:18.920
reason. Um, but yeah, it's, it's a fun game. It's Mario Kart. I mean, we expect, um, I

13:18.920 --> 13:23.880
did like some of their choices though for the retro courses. Although I got to say this,

13:23.880 --> 13:29.080
um, my least favorite course in that game has to be probably the, uh, Neo Bowser city.

13:29.080 --> 13:34.480
It's just such a waste. I mean, it could have been cool, but it's just like, you know, I

13:34.480 --> 13:38.520
don't know. It's such a waste of course. I like this black Wolf in our chat room. Of

13:38.520 --> 13:42.540
course the, the man Bobby black Wolf who comes on before us here at all games radio, uh,

13:42.540 --> 13:48.400
says Mario Kart is the original asshole Mario. You ever seen that mod for super Mario world

13:48.400 --> 13:53.840
asshole Mario? That's, that's a very good comparison. I don't remember like the AI being

13:53.840 --> 13:57.480
that bad and like the original game and stuff. I mean, what for the CC was pretty hard, pretty

13:57.480 --> 14:02.200
bad in the original game. It was pretty, maybe the rubber banding was infuriating. Like that's

14:02.200 --> 14:05.440
just all they would do. It wasn't so much the shell cause there was no blue shell in

14:05.440 --> 14:09.600
the original Mario. I fucking hate the blue shell. I seriously think it's the worst thing

14:09.600 --> 14:16.880
ever. It's just like, it's the, the lightning. It's like the participation award of Mario

14:16.880 --> 14:24.200
Kart. It's like, I suck. I need a show that kills first place. The honorable mention.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.520
That's the ribbon. But no, no, the lightning bolt was supposed to be your, that was in

14:27.520 --> 14:30.680
the original Mario Kart and the lightning bolt was supposed to be the like, fuck everybody

14:30.680 --> 14:35.080
up thing, you know? And that was like the, I am in control. I'm powerful, you know, pass

14:35.080 --> 14:39.320
everybody. Blue shell too much. And I don't like it. All the items aren't, I mean, it

14:39.320 --> 14:43.280
gives you better items obviously in the further back that you are. Fuck that. It should be

14:43.280 --> 14:50.080
even all around. Why shouldn't I be getting green shells and banana peels for being in

14:50.080 --> 14:54.800
first place? I will say though, online I got one of those seven power ups that gives you

14:54.800 --> 14:59.320
just seven fricking items and bam, bam, bam, just firing them all. That was pretty awesome

14:59.320 --> 15:03.880
and I, I made up a lot of space with that one and I know people didn't like me. But

15:03.880 --> 15:08.080
here's the thing. I think that power up sucks. I think in most of it's useless. It's just

15:08.080 --> 15:15.520
like whatever. Are you kidding? I fucked some people up with that. It was awesome. All right.

15:15.520 --> 15:21.840
So there, yeah, Mario Kart. It's pretty awesome. Looking forward to playing it online. Um,

15:21.840 --> 15:24.960
what else? Oh, Super Mario 3 Land. I can't really say too much about it cause I really

15:24.960 --> 15:28.360
didn't get a chance to play it much cause I've been playing mostly Mario Kart. I did

15:28.360 --> 15:32.840
try a little bit of it and I got through maybe a quarter of the first stage in the, you know,

15:32.840 --> 15:38.080
the very first level and then I had to quit. So, I mean, it looks pretty and it plays like

15:38.080 --> 15:43.360
a Mario game. Um, I don't know. That's really all I can say right now. It kind of reminds

15:43.360 --> 15:49.480
me a lot of, you know, Mario 64 I guess. Um, but in the, the setup's kind of a little bit

15:49.480 --> 15:54.400
like Mario Galaxy. But, I mean, that's it. I mean, I'm looking forward to playing more

15:54.400 --> 16:02.960
of it. Although, I'm looking forward to playing more Mario Kart than I am Mario 3 Land. Um,

16:02.960 --> 16:07.720
and then, uh, what else did I play? Oh, I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 3

16:07.720 --> 16:16.280
the 10th anniversary edition on my iPod. And it looks nice. But damn, I really wish there

16:16.280 --> 16:20.320
was like Bluetooth support for some sort of controller because it sucks trying to control

16:20.320 --> 16:24.320
that on the... I knew the touchpad was gonna be terrible for that. Well, I mean, it's,

16:24.320 --> 16:29.160
it's, it's good for touch controls, I guess. I mean, but, I mean, there's not a lot you

16:29.160 --> 16:34.840
can really do with touch controls on a game like that. I mean, they have it set up, it

16:34.840 --> 16:40.280
may make sense, but it's just, touch controls suck all the time for a game like that. I

16:40.280 --> 16:45.280
mean, I even tried playing like some of the Gangstar stuff, um, before and it's just,

16:45.280 --> 16:51.240
it doesn't work. But, it looks nice. I just hope that someday Apple will, you know, wise

16:51.240 --> 16:55.360
up and actually have, you know, some sort of controller that would work with some of

16:55.360 --> 16:59.680
these games. I know that some third party companies have done that, but obviously most

16:59.680 --> 17:03.080
of the games don't support that. Yeah, that thing for the iPad's pretty awesome. The little

17:03.080 --> 17:06.560
arcade machine that you can put it in. Well, that's not so bad. A coworker of mine had

17:06.560 --> 17:11.240
this awesome, like, keyboard looking thing that the iPad kind of plugged into the top

17:11.240 --> 17:15.720
of the flat keyboard and it made it look like a laptop that you could touch the screen on.

17:15.720 --> 17:21.480
It was, it was nice. Hmm. I mean, so, it would be kind of neat if they did something like

17:21.480 --> 17:26.240
that because, damn, I mean, it really sucks that some of these games, just the touch controls

17:26.240 --> 17:33.240
are not good. Alright, anything else? Uh, words of friends, because my wife wants me

17:33.240 --> 17:39.320
the player, and so I'm playing a little bit of that. Uh, and please, you know, I've been

17:39.320 --> 17:44.120
getting invites to SimSocial, I am not fucking playing the SimSocial, so you can just save

17:44.120 --> 17:48.400
yourself some time. I deleted it and blocked it. Do not send me any more invites for that

17:48.400 --> 17:54.920
game. Yep. I'm over it too. Alright, um, quickly, getting into my gaming week, um, not a whole

17:54.920 --> 18:00.960
lot. Call of duty. Shush, you're done. Not a whole lot of new stuff in my week. Uh, still

18:00.960 --> 18:05.840
more wow, still more Saints Row the Third, which is, uh, fun. I, I'm loving all the little

18:05.840 --> 18:08.960
activities in that game, it is so over the top. I never thought I would enjoy this game

18:08.960 --> 18:12.640
as much as I do, but Loki, I hate to say it, you were right, you were so right, this game

18:12.640 --> 18:17.760
is great. I love it. And I did, I played one of the Tron things, like the, the bike thing

18:17.760 --> 18:21.800
that, it's kind of like light bike mixed with the Sonic 2 bonus level. Yeah. I think it's

18:21.800 --> 18:27.240
kind of, well, let me put it this way. It's kind of basic, but it does Tron better than

18:27.240 --> 18:32.360
the Tron PS3 game did bike racing, which was awful. The bike racing, like, killed that

18:32.360 --> 18:39.200
Tron game. It was so bad. So. I thought it was, it was weak, but it's still better than,

18:39.200 --> 18:45.800
yeah, yeah. It's better than Yaris. Um, but not by much. Uh, let's see. Uh, also some

18:45.800 --> 18:49.720
new games I've been playing, not really a new game, but like Dark Soccer, I bought the

18:49.720 --> 18:54.560
indie bundle and I can't stop playing Cave Story, which is like a years old game, came

18:54.560 --> 18:59.080
out in a new one on the 3DS and dah, dah, dah, but Cave Story Plus to be specific is

18:59.080 --> 19:03.240
the one that you get with the bundle. If you pay more than the average, I love it. Like

19:03.240 --> 19:07.640
if you haven't played this game, you should definitely, I mean, for one, this indie bundle

19:07.640 --> 19:11.800
that's out right now is amazing. And I know there's a story coming up on the show later.

19:11.800 --> 19:17.800
We'll tell you all the games that are in it, but it's, it's just such a great cause, great

19:17.800 --> 19:21.720
deal, great games. And especially the games you're getting this time around, like what?

19:21.720 --> 19:25.960
Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner. Yeah. You convinced me with Bit.Trip Runner. Oh,

19:25.960 --> 19:30.200
Bit.Trip Runner is a great game too. So, um, yeah, but Cave Story, it's kind of like, it

19:30.200 --> 19:34.320
reminds me of an old NES game, obviously with the graphics and the music, the music's great.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.880
And I guess now you get the soundtracks, which is awesome. Uh, and it kind of reminded me,

19:37.880 --> 19:42.560
I wanted to say, I don't know why, but like Fashanadu, you remember that game? Uh, it

19:42.560 --> 19:46.120
kind of reminded me of that a little bit, even though it wasn't really the swords, but

19:46.120 --> 19:50.160
it was kind of like that exploring the different multiple screens and kind of the music reminded

19:50.160 --> 19:56.200
me of it a little bit. So yeah, Cave Story's awesome. I like that game. And, um, otherwise

19:56.200 --> 20:01.760
been playing some old school Game Boy advanced games as a 3DS ambassador, namely WarioWare

20:01.760 --> 20:05.360
is the one that I can't stop playing. The original WarioWare was so good. And I'm so

20:05.360 --> 20:09.880
glad that that's a part of the, uh, ambassador package. Cause that, that alone is worth it.

20:09.880 --> 20:15.720
So yeah, that's pretty much it for my gaming week otherwise. Um, so we're going to move

20:15.720 --> 20:19.680
on into some housekeeping before I get into housekeeping. I want to talk quickly. Uh,

20:19.680 --> 20:23.920
we're going to have an interview in a little bit and it's with my friend Justin. He's going

20:23.920 --> 20:28.800
to call in in about five minutes or so after we get through some other announcements here.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.440
And he's going to talk to us about his Xbox hack experience. And, um, I know you guys

20:33.440 --> 20:36.920
have heard about mine and I came on here and I bitched about it and how I couldn't play

20:36.920 --> 20:43.400
my Xbox for 20 days and it was pretty bad and all this, but like my story has got nothing

20:43.400 --> 20:48.280
on what you're about to hear Justin talk about. And I thought it was important to get it out

20:48.280 --> 20:53.580
there that this is happening because when you guys hear like the, the hoops he's jumping

20:53.580 --> 20:56.740
through and what's going on, your jaw will be on the floor and like, he's not making

20:56.740 --> 21:02.520
it up. It's all legit. Like I trust Justin. Justin, uh, met at E3 and, and, uh, you know,

21:02.520 --> 21:06.920
we hung out and stuff, so I know it's all legit and it's, um, you're going to be shocked.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.640
So we'll get to that in a little bit, but first, um, some important housekeeping we

21:09.640 --> 21:14.240
wanted to cover tonight. Um, there will be no show next week. Uh, most important, uh,

21:14.240 --> 21:18.360
our show happens to be on December 25th, which, uh, you know, it's kind of a big deal for

21:18.360 --> 21:24.260
some people. Um, and, uh, so yeah, no show that night. Bobby will still be live. So if

21:24.260 --> 21:27.360
you're at all games radio and you're like, I'm lonely, I want to party with somebody

21:27.360 --> 21:32.120
on Christmas. Bobby will still be here at five o'clock Pacific. We will not. And, um,

21:32.120 --> 21:37.620
even also, uh, I'm kidding. Love, love. I said on Twitter and I said on Facebook and

21:37.620 --> 21:44.800
I wasn't lying. Um, we have to say goodbye tonight. And, um, things change. And, um,

21:44.800 --> 21:49.560
Dark Sakura, uh, well, do you want to tell the listeners what's going on? I don't know

21:49.560 --> 21:59.720
how much you don't want to say, but I'm leaving. I'm moving. It's been coming for a while and

21:59.720 --> 22:04.120
it's finally happened. And I know I've brought it up before, but the move is actually happening.

22:04.120 --> 22:14.160
Um, we had pack up and be out and so we are moving down the street. So we're saying goodbye

22:14.160 --> 22:20.320
to the orange lounge radio studio five. Bye. But maybe you made someone's heart skip a

22:20.320 --> 22:24.720
beat there a little bit, but unfortunately that was so awesome. That was a, it was, it

22:24.720 --> 22:29.080
was looking pretty scary there for a minute that you might have to move. Yeah. Dan still

22:29.080 --> 22:34.640
wants us to go to Washington, but I'm like, so, um, so this is the fifth. You will still

22:34.640 --> 22:39.040
have a show me at your feet. Yes, I will. That'll be great. Uh, this is the fifth studio

22:39.040 --> 22:44.000
that we've taped to orange on radio in. Um, the first was that house that I had with Brian

22:44.000 --> 22:47.560
back in the day. I don't think ever came on the show, but that was, that house was the

22:47.560 --> 22:52.240
first studio. The second studio was when Loki and I lived together. Uh, the third studio

22:52.240 --> 22:55.840
is when the extra for and I lived together and that was a lot of change to the station.

22:55.840 --> 23:00.120
That was the studio where the news came out and filmed us. That was a studio where we

23:00.120 --> 23:05.680
switched to all teams radio. By the way, what's that? They also came to your guys's place

23:05.680 --> 23:11.320
to yours and Loki's. Oh, that's right. The paper did. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I got a foot

23:11.320 --> 23:19.380
on there. Fantastic. So, uh, let's see. And then, um, the news did come here. The net,

23:19.380 --> 23:24.040
the fourth studio was when I was in the house in the garage, in the garage, the cold, the

23:24.040 --> 23:31.000
jet, the one that's on Justin TV, super hot. Sometimes the garage with no steady temperature.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.160
And then we've been in this studio for well over a year. It's been at least, yeah, probably

23:36.160 --> 23:41.960
almost two years, but my house is comfortable and has a heater. And sure me, you've got

23:41.960 --> 23:46.920
sure me to keep your feet warm. So, um, and by the way, there's a, our chats finally catching

23:46.920 --> 23:50.600
up with a buffer and everything. Just reading a, some of our chat room chat that orange

23:50.600 --> 23:55.840
on twitter.com red said, you guys had me for a sec. Uh, bochi Kawa says, OMGs. I was scurred.

23:55.840 --> 24:00.520
Uh, catastrophic. Moggy says, yeah, my heart did skip a beat. Rob and Darth spasinator

24:00.520 --> 24:05.700
sums it up best. Damn you. Dark Sakura making us think you're leaving OLR. That was good.

24:05.700 --> 24:10.240
You did that very well. Orange rice said, oh, you trolls, but no, I mean, but it is

24:10.240 --> 24:14.320
still, I mean, obviously the studio is a big part of the show and, and here's the interesting

24:14.320 --> 24:20.120
thing. Um, you know, we're, we had a planned week off next week. Anyway, we're going to

24:20.120 --> 24:26.760
be back in two weeks. Hopefully it's looking like 90% sure we'll be back in two weeks.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.080
There is a strong possibility though. We may not, we may not be set up in time because

24:30.080 --> 24:35.160
we are now unexpectedly having to move the studios. Um, the, the office is going to be

24:35.160 --> 24:38.760
a little smaller. I can tell you that, but we'll, we should be fine. We also don't exactly

24:38.760 --> 24:42.640
know where studio six is going to be. We think it's going to be a dark sacros. You just have

24:42.640 --> 24:47.140
to make sure it's going to work cause it might come back to where I'm at. So from an undisclosed

24:47.140 --> 24:51.480
location is where the next orange lounge radio will be. So it's going to be a whole new year,

24:51.480 --> 24:59.480
a whole new OLR, but what an appropriate way to kick off our 10th year of radio from 2002

24:59.480 --> 25:05.320
to 2012 with a new studio. You know what, I'm going to go ahead and say it. What's that?

25:05.320 --> 25:11.280
Fuck you, Wells Fargo. What's that for? Oh, cause I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Why we're moving.

25:11.280 --> 25:20.120
You know what, honestly, it's not even, it's, it's a case of overextension when with combined

25:20.120 --> 25:28.360
with the housing market drop is what facilitated our situation. But man, I tell you, apartments

25:28.360 --> 25:34.280
are freaking expensive. And then like we got a house for what apartment rent for a smaller

25:34.280 --> 25:40.780
place would have been. So it's really expensive where Dan works too. But I mean, so right

25:40.780 --> 25:47.600
now though, and we got a good landlord who is really going to work with us. So, and honestly

25:47.600 --> 25:52.600
we found his house, called him the next day. Two days later we're in. Nice. So yeah, I

25:52.600 --> 25:56.400
worked out really well. I'm sure people who followed me on my Facebook knew about the

25:56.400 --> 26:01.180
drama. So, uh, Tiger Claw on chat says, I guess the studio where you and Travis did

26:01.180 --> 26:04.800
the shows was studio number one. I didn't count that one cause we didn't do orange lounge

26:04.800 --> 26:07.920
radio from there. That was under station live, different show. And besides, he didn't really

26:07.920 --> 26:12.400
call that studio one. I believe that was what the masturbation station inside the pleasure

26:12.400 --> 26:18.640
dome, beautiful inbred Sacramento. I don't know, whatever he called it. So no, that,

26:18.640 --> 26:24.840
that, that didn't have a number. That was studio zero. Um, let's see. Uh, and, uh, Zethur

26:24.840 --> 26:28.880
says, I knew you guys were joking. We're not joking. We are saying goodbye to the studio.

26:28.880 --> 26:36.360
Yeah, no, we were joking. I am leaving this house. Dark Sakura is moving. We have to be

26:36.360 --> 26:44.200
out of here by the third so that we get money. So yeah. Oh, and, and Bobby, just to let you

26:44.200 --> 26:50.480
know, um, our next step is to buy a house. So yeah. Good luck. All right. So, um, we'll

26:50.480 --> 26:56.000
be back in two weeks from somewhere. Welcome to adult life kids. This is what you have

26:56.000 --> 27:00.160
to look forward to. Growing up sucks. Life's going to suck when you grow up. When you grow

27:00.160 --> 27:03.600
up, when you grow up, life's going to suck when you grow up. It sucks pretty bad right

27:03.600 --> 27:07.760
now. Uh, okay. So I guess that's, what else can we say about that? I don't think there

27:07.760 --> 27:12.760
is anything else to say about that. So goodbye studio five after tonight. Maybe the good

27:12.760 --> 27:16.880
news is maybe we can get a webcam again. Maybe we can be better wired to stream games because

27:16.880 --> 27:21.880
this studio is really kind of supposed to get a rig. Well, wasn't supposed to be temporary.

27:21.880 --> 27:27.760
Yeah. You're on my drawing table. It just kind of lasted. Although I got it at Ikea

27:27.760 --> 27:31.680
and it's not really a drawing table. So whatever. I'm just glad to tell you though, our house,

27:31.680 --> 27:35.200
our new house is super cute. You know what I just realized? What? This is one of my old

27:35.200 --> 27:41.720
roommates folding chairs. I totally jacked it from him for the studio. So we can bring

27:41.720 --> 27:45.240
a piece of the old studio with us. That's right. We can. But man, this house though

27:45.240 --> 27:50.120
is super cute and we'll get to keep the pinball tables in the living room. That's good. Pinball

27:50.120 --> 27:55.120
tables are important. Our landlord walked in today cause he came in to sign the papers

27:55.120 --> 28:01.920
with us and he looked in the, in the pinball room. It was like, what is this? We're like,

28:01.920 --> 28:07.320
this is our coolness, sir. It was like, I haven't seen pinball in years. I was like,

28:07.320 --> 28:15.440
that's super cool. You knock off a few hundred dollars a month and uh, yeah, maybe traded.

28:15.440 --> 28:21.000
Well we, I offered up my services to if any of his grandchildren needed posters made for

28:21.000 --> 28:28.200
their projects. Nice. So cause I'm shameless. I'll work for anybody. I'm a designer, dammit.

28:28.200 --> 28:32.400
Give me design stuff to do. All right. Um, I think we're going to move into some of tonight's

28:32.400 --> 28:35.560
news, but we need to be a little bit flexible cause the interview should be calling in any

28:35.560 --> 28:38.840
minute. So we might have to kind of like go, go cause there's a live interview tonight.

28:38.840 --> 28:43.800
So if you want to ask questions, you can in chat.orangelandraday.com. Um, so Loki, I guess

28:43.800 --> 28:46.600
go ahead and try and start us off here. We might have to kind of cut it in the middle

28:46.600 --> 28:51.920
here. Sure. Why not? Um, if there's a report coming from Bloomberg, same, and this is basically

28:51.920 --> 28:55.800
saying something that they've already kind of rumored to before. Microsoft is going to

28:55.800 --> 28:59.720
create its own TV programming for Xbox live, which is great cause I was hoping they would

28:59.720 --> 29:06.120
kind of do that cause as much as I like to see on demand stuff for Comcast, which I can

29:06.120 --> 29:10.920
get by an on demand, well I used to be able to get via on demand, but unfortunately now

29:10.920 --> 29:17.480
we have a terrible, terrible, really low tech cable box that doesn't have on demand. Not

29:17.480 --> 29:22.480
that I care. Um, but it would be nice to see extra content on top of the stuff that's already

29:22.480 --> 29:25.240
there. And honestly, I haven't really looked at some of the other stuff that they have.

29:25.240 --> 29:30.600
I looked at YouTube and TMZ and all that this week and it's kind of weak. I didn't, I, I

29:30.600 --> 29:35.160
mean, I guess, yay, you can look at YouTube's on your Xbox, but I don't like the interface.

29:35.160 --> 29:39.500
They really just force everything to use that, that new interface and it doesn't really work

29:39.500 --> 29:43.320
well for something like YouTube. I feel like if I want to watch something, what I really

29:43.320 --> 29:48.640
need to do to make it work is to go queue it up on my computer, in my playlist, and

29:48.640 --> 29:53.580
then go to my Xbox and watch it on the Xbox. I mean, if you want to watch like popular

29:53.580 --> 29:56.920
YouTubes and things like that, like that's really easy to find cause it shows you the

29:56.920 --> 30:01.000
most popular. What about like a stuff you're subscribing to? Is it easy to find that? Um,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.560
yeah, that, that, that does all kind of pop up. It's not, it's not bad. You can link it

30:04.560 --> 30:09.600
to your YouTube. Basically, um, you say link to my YouTube account and it'll show you a code on

30:09.600 --> 30:12.800
the screen and you go run to your computer and type that code in while you're signed

30:12.800 --> 30:17.200
into Google and then it links the two together. Kind of like how Netflix works. So, but it

30:17.200 --> 30:22.840
works. I mean, it's fantastic. Why? I don't know. This sounds stupid. Here's, here's the

30:22.840 --> 30:28.720
thing and I don't know if you know this, Logie. Um, you can't watch any clip that's been flagged

30:28.720 --> 30:33.280
for copyright content. Like, you know how like YouTube will keep some of the copyright

30:33.280 --> 30:37.280
content stuff up, but it'll just have a link to whatever song is being used in it at the

30:37.280 --> 30:41.480
bottom. You know, say like this has stuff from UMG music group and click here to buy

30:41.480 --> 30:48.520
the song though. All of those are pulled from Xbox live, which I act, I get why because,

30:48.520 --> 30:52.360
you know, there's all the jukebox usage rights and all that stuff and they don't want to

30:52.360 --> 30:57.080
pay it, but it does put a damper on some of the things that you want to really watch on

30:57.080 --> 31:01.960
YouTube. But like I would think like, okay, like the way that Jamie and Dan have it set

31:01.960 --> 31:06.720
up, they watch YouTube's a lot on their TV of like game play throughs and stuff, but

31:06.720 --> 31:11.080
I don't think they should have to change that. But not everybody sets up a rig like that.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.240
Yeah. Well, here's the thing though. It's like an, and I understand that it's kind of

31:14.240 --> 31:18.040
cool that they have that and stuff, but I'll, I'll tell you this much. To get a rig to actually

31:18.040 --> 31:25.880
watch YouTube videos on a TV, um, is fucking dirt cheap. I mean, so dirt cheap. It's ridiculous.

31:25.880 --> 31:31.000
I remember actually one time, uh, well I was last year actually that, um, not actually

31:31.000 --> 31:35.280
this year, I was doing that, was it project under $100 thing where I was going to create

31:35.280 --> 31:38.880
a main cabinet under a hundred dollars. Yeah, whatever happened to that? Yeah, I just didn't,

31:38.880 --> 31:42.680
I didn't want to build a main cabinet out of cardboard boxes. So I came out to $101

31:42.680 --> 31:47.320
and you were like, shit. No, no, I was able to do it under a hundred dollars, but, um,

31:47.320 --> 31:50.640
I just didn't want to. I saw the computer and stuff though in my garage, but I bought

31:50.640 --> 31:55.600
the computer for 30 bucks. It's a Pentium 4 for 30 bucks and it was, I mean, it's capable

31:55.600 --> 32:00.760
of running MAME and most of the games for, but a Pentium 4 computer can also run YouTube.

32:00.760 --> 32:05.680
I mean, I think for the most part and hell, you can even get like, you know, mini ITX

32:05.680 --> 32:10.440
computers or Adam computers or whatever. Um, very, very dirt cheap if you want to set up

32:10.440 --> 32:15.240
something that's mainly for watching YouTube videos or fuck any other, if you have a computer

32:15.240 --> 32:20.800
at home, it's moving next to the computer, you know, to your TV and you can watch videos

32:20.800 --> 32:26.460
that way. I mean, that's, it's just a lot easier than having the fuck around with these

32:26.460 --> 32:31.760
apps and stuff. And to me, it's sad that they have it that way. That's so difficult to just

32:31.760 --> 32:32.760
have it work.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.720
I'm going to jump in here. We're going to come back to the subject in a little bit,

32:35.720 --> 32:38.840
but as I promised a little bit earlier, um, I'm waiting for a phone call and that phone

32:38.840 --> 32:41.320
call is coming in right now. So, hi caller, are you there?

32:41.320 --> 32:42.320
Hello.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.720
Hey, is this Justin?

32:44.720 --> 32:45.720
Sure is.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.120
What is up Justin? First off, thank you so much for calling in tonight. Um, you're like

32:49.120 --> 32:51.680
on vacation or something right now, right?

32:51.680 --> 32:57.520
I am. I'm a halfway home from Disneyland. Me and the lady, uh, drove out there. I got

32:57.520 --> 32:59.280
a couple of days. We're heading back to Vegas now.

32:59.280 --> 33:02.920
Nice. I saw you did my tip at Haunted Mansion on Foursquare.

33:02.920 --> 33:07.440
Yeah. Yeah. I think you left a couple tips throughout Disneyland and I did whatever I

33:07.440 --> 33:08.440
found.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.680
I probably did. Well, that's awesome. Well, anyway, um, Justin, thanks for calling in

33:11.680 --> 33:15.340
tonight. Um, I, let me, I tried to give a little bit of background before you called

33:15.340 --> 33:19.280
in tonight, but I know everybody knows you're calling in to talk about Xbox hacks tonight

33:19.280 --> 33:23.360
and I got to say, I've been following your updates through Twitter because you and I

33:23.360 --> 33:28.360
got hacked kind of around the same time, but it seems like your shit has been going on

33:28.360 --> 33:36.600
forever. And yeah, it lasted four months and I've, I've seen your updates on Facebook and

33:36.600 --> 33:40.600
it came to the point where I'm like, Justin, I, I need you to call in and tell this story

33:40.600 --> 33:46.000
because people need to hear how bad Microsoft is dicking people around with this. So I think

33:46.000 --> 33:48.480
for people to better understand this, let's go back to the beginning.

33:48.480 --> 33:54.240
So let's talk about day one. First time you ever found out your Xbox got hacked. What

33:54.240 --> 33:55.880
happened? How'd you find out you were hacked?

33:55.880 --> 34:00.920
All right. Uh, let me start by saying I am on the road and if signal cuts out, you know,

34:00.920 --> 34:04.360
I'll call back, but just let me know if the signal starts cutting out, we'll, we'll make

34:04.360 --> 34:11.840
it work. So day one back in August, it was like August, uh, mid August, say the 13th,

34:11.840 --> 34:19.560
14th, something like that. Uh, I get an email saying that, uh, my, the, what was it? I got

34:19.560 --> 34:25.560
a purchase confirmation for, uh, altogether $125 worth of Microsoft points.

34:25.560 --> 34:30.400
Was it all that FIFA stuff? Was it the FIFA stuff?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.200
What's that? Was it the FIFA 12 stuff that it seems like

34:33.200 --> 34:38.080
No, actually, uh, the FIFA stuff, I, mine had nothing to do with any of the FIFA stuff.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.880
I heard a ton of people get screwed over by the FIFA thing. Uh, and apparently that was

34:43.880 --> 34:48.480
because there's something you can do on FIFA where it equates to real money. I guess that

34:48.480 --> 34:54.640
like people are building these super teams at FIFA, uh, by purchasing, uh, players, uh,

34:54.640 --> 35:00.240
they have booster packs basically. And then they're selling the killer teams on Hebay

35:00.240 --> 35:04.040
or what have you. So that's why people get screwed over with the FIFA stuff. But mine

35:04.040 --> 35:09.320
was not related to that at all. I got one confirmation for 75 bucks and then another

35:09.320 --> 35:17.720
one for 50 bucks. Uh, I got, I found it probably a couple hours after it happened. So I went

35:17.720 --> 35:22.360
in, I checked, uh, checked all my stuff. I had to reset my password to get in there.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.840
Saw that they had bought a bunch of, uh, I think they bought Alan Wake, Resident Evil

35:27.840 --> 35:36.040
5, uh, some DLC for both of those, Assassin's Creed brotherhoods, DLC for that, some themes,

35:36.040 --> 35:40.200
uh, and then just some other miscellaneous stuff. But it was all just kind of random

35:40.200 --> 35:45.320
stuff. I thought that they had played a little bit of them. So I called Microsoft, well first

35:45.320 --> 35:49.600
I called the bank. I called bank of America and I said, Hey, fraudulent charges, yada

35:49.600 --> 35:53.320
yada. They said, okay, we'll just take care of it. Next day they had my money back. So

35:53.320 --> 35:58.000
no problems there. I called Microsoft right after I called the bank and I told them what

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
had happened and they said, okay, well, uh, we're sorry this happened. We're going to

36:02.000 --> 36:06.960
close your countdown while we look into it and we'll have this taken care of within 25

36:06.960 --> 36:12.440
business days or something like that. There would be no longer than 25 to 30 days.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.440
One thing I want to jump in here and point out real quick, just one small difference

36:15.440 --> 36:18.880
between what you did and what I did is that you called your bank first and I didn't do

36:18.880 --> 36:24.680
that. I called, or I called Microsoft first and I think, yeah, I find that kind of interesting

36:24.680 --> 36:28.200
because I wonder if that's part of the reason why here's story's going to take a different

36:28.200 --> 36:32.760
turn here in a minute. But anyway, sorry. I just want to point that out. Go ahead.

36:32.760 --> 36:39.320
Okay. So yeah, I, uh, I waited a little while, uh, probably three or four weeks and then

36:39.320 --> 36:42.160
I called back and said, Hey, just checking in. Just want to see what's going on. And

36:42.160 --> 36:45.800
I said, well, you know, we're still working on it. I said, okay, cool. So I waited a little

36:45.800 --> 36:50.080
bit longer, a couple of weeks past. And at this point we're past the 25 days they had

36:50.080 --> 36:53.760
voted me. So I called back and I said, Hey, uh, you know, you guys missed your deadline.

36:53.760 --> 36:58.180
I just wanted to get a status update, find out what's going on. You know, same as before

36:58.180 --> 37:02.920
they were apologetics. Uh, they didn't have any news for me. They told me there's nothing

37:02.920 --> 37:08.600
they can do to, uh, figure out, uh, with any more detail what's actually going on. Uh,

37:08.600 --> 37:12.720
now I just have to stick it out. So at that point I said, well, can you guys hook me up

37:12.720 --> 37:16.080
with anything to make a support? They said, sure. Here's the code for a free month of

37:16.080 --> 37:21.840
Xbox live. And, uh, they assured me that that would be on top of whatever time I get reimbursed

37:21.840 --> 37:25.800
at the end of the whole fiasco. So I said, all right, we'll, we'll three months, a live

37:25.800 --> 37:32.960
whatever hung up one about my business, few more weeks past. And I called back and, uh,

37:32.960 --> 37:37.120
they said the same thing. I whined about it a little more. They gave me another code for

37:37.120 --> 37:42.640
a month of live. And that was that few more weeks past. And this is the point where I

37:42.640 --> 37:49.920
started taking angry Facebook posts, Twitter posts, Google plus posts, trying to get screwed

37:49.920 --> 37:52.880
over here. At this point, you've said a few weeks, a few weeks, a few weeks. So you're

37:52.880 --> 37:58.920
talking like you're at like 10, 12 weeks at this point, right? Were you somewhere between

37:58.920 --> 38:02.980
two and three months, around two months is when I started getting really upset because

38:02.980 --> 38:06.680
I wasn't playing my Xbox a whole lot. I figured at least I'll have this all sorted by the

38:06.680 --> 38:11.160
time all the good games start coming out, I'll be able to play modern warfare three

38:11.160 --> 38:17.440
and all that stuff. Right. So the, when I really got upset was the day modern warfare

38:17.440 --> 38:22.440
three came out. Now I'm not a fan of the modern warfare series, but I figured this was going

38:22.440 --> 38:25.720
to be here. I was going to get it, start playing with all my friends and get into all that

38:25.720 --> 38:29.840
stuff. Well, I bought modern warfare three and then remembered, Oh, wait, I can't play

38:29.840 --> 38:35.280
online. So I called against that night and I said, look, this wasn't a problem before

38:35.280 --> 38:39.120
the games are starting to come out that I want to play. So I need to have this fixed

38:39.120 --> 38:44.200
and same thing, just, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I don't have any more information.

38:44.200 --> 38:50.280
We're very sorry this happened, but there's nothing we can do. So what else can I do?

38:50.280 --> 38:53.840
You know, I was starting to feel pretty hopeless at this point. I said, okay, well deal with

38:53.840 --> 38:59.640
it. And I went, played some, I started playing something on my Wii, I think. I went back

38:59.640 --> 39:06.160
and started playing Mario Galaxy or something. So a couple more weeks passed and I'm at the

39:06.160 --> 39:09.920
point where I'm telling them every time I call like, look, I'm going to call every week

39:09.920 --> 39:16.880
now and keep on doing this until I, until I get a result. And I did so I kept on calling

39:16.880 --> 39:21.000
and every time they just would give me the run around and say, no, there's nothing we

39:21.000 --> 39:30.800
can do. So about a week ago I called and I don't know about a week ago I got an email

39:30.800 --> 39:35.760
saying, Hey, we see that you got, you regained access to your account. So we're closing your

39:35.760 --> 39:41.680
case, have fun. And I was on my way to work at this time so I could check on it immediately.

39:41.680 --> 39:46.240
But when I got to work, I went online and I checked it out and I still couldn't get

39:46.240 --> 39:50.840
to my account via xbox.com and still said your account is temporarily blocked.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.720
And to point this out, you're talking from August to a week ago, December.

39:54.720 --> 40:00.640
Yeah. Yeah. From mid August until last week. So I got the email that said that everything

40:00.640 --> 40:05.120
was good. I went to xbox.com and found out that everything was not good because I still

40:05.120 --> 40:10.480
couldn't get to my account. So I called them on my lunch break and I said, look, I got

40:10.480 --> 40:14.640
this email. I mean, it's been going on since August, try and understand my frustration

40:14.640 --> 40:19.360
here. Like I apologize upfront because I knew I was going to get hostile at some point during

40:19.360 --> 40:27.040
a phone call. So I told them the whole situation, let them read over my case notes, gave them

40:27.040 --> 40:33.000
like three service requests numbers I had, uh, told them, you know, I want to be able

40:33.000 --> 40:37.080
to play my xbox. You know, I got this email, but I still can't get to my account. And they

40:37.080 --> 40:40.480
said, Oh, okay, we'll go to your console. And I said, well, I'm not at my console on

40:40.480 --> 40:46.080
my lunch break. So they said, all right, we'll call it back later when you're at your console.

40:46.080 --> 40:52.480
And at this point I really felt like I would get ripped off here. So I asked them if they

40:52.480 --> 40:56.400
could do anything like give me a year of xbox live to pick up for it. Cause what's a year

40:56.400 --> 41:02.880
of xbox live, 40 or 50 bucks. Right. Right. So, so I asked them that and they said, no,

41:02.880 --> 41:07.280
actually we can't do that. That's kind of what I was expecting, but I will talk to someone

41:07.280 --> 41:11.640
who can hook that up and she said, well, let me talk to my supervisor, but you won't be

41:11.640 --> 41:15.800
able to do anything either. So supervisor came on, told her the whole situation after

41:15.800 --> 41:21.520
a year of life. She said, no, I can't do that. I can get you, uh, two extra months. We see

41:21.520 --> 41:25.800
that you already got two months before I can give you two more months and that I'll pick

41:25.800 --> 41:31.280
up for the four months that you lost. And that'll be that. And at this point I'm a little

41:31.280 --> 41:37.560
angry because before I got those two one month codes, they told me that those months would

41:37.560 --> 41:43.680
be on top of whatever time I was reimbursed. So I relate this information to the supervisor

41:43.680 --> 41:47.520
I was now talking to and she said, well, you were misinformed. We can give you two months

41:47.520 --> 41:55.280
or not take it or leave it. And so I, I mean, I, I never, ever yell at people on the phone

41:55.280 --> 42:02.080
because I know they have jobs and I would hate to be answered. So I blew up at this

42:02.080 --> 42:06.720
point. I just, you know, kind of let her have it. I said, look, I mean, this is four months.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.880
You don't, I don't think you understand how much trouble this has been for me. I've been

42:10.880 --> 42:16.440
on the phone literally like five or six hours total with Microsoft trying to get this resolved

42:16.440 --> 42:21.640
and all because don't jerk off, pack an alert bank account or hacked into my Xbox account

42:21.640 --> 42:27.000
and spent a bunch of my money. Like I feel like I'm being punished for nothing. I did.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.080
And she was not very receptive to that. She took kind of reiterated, I can give you two

42:33.080 --> 42:37.240
months on top of two months where he gave you about that. So we went back and forth.

42:37.240 --> 42:40.800
You know, I kept on saying that it's ridiculous. This is ridiculous. She kept sitting there

42:40.800 --> 42:48.160
with nothing to do. Finally, she conceded and said, okay, well I'll give you 500 points

42:48.160 --> 42:55.280
in addition to the two bucks. And yeah, exactly. I said, what is that, six bucks? Like is that

42:55.280 --> 43:00.280
one of my five or six dollars? What does that translate to, five hundred bucks?

43:00.280 --> 43:01.280
Six twenty five.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.280
Yeah, six twenty five.

43:02.280 --> 43:06.840
Six twenty five. Okay. So yeah, we're six dollars and twenty five cents for Microsoft

43:06.840 --> 43:10.800
at the cost of that. And I told her like, you realize you're about to lose a customer

43:10.800 --> 43:16.960
over, you know, 50 bucks, right? Because all I'm asking for is a year and a half, that's

43:16.960 --> 43:21.680
it. She just kept on reiterating. She couldn't do anything. So I took what I could get from

43:21.680 --> 43:25.680
her because my lunch break was over. I had to get back to work. I left her my contact

43:25.680 --> 43:31.280
info and asked her to have her supervisor. Oh, right. I asked to speak to her supervisor

43:31.280 --> 43:36.880
earlier on the call and she said that he wouldn't be in until the next day in the evening. So

43:36.880 --> 43:43.200
she was apparently the highest level person I could talk to at that time. So, so anyway,

43:43.200 --> 43:48.440
she said she would pass along my contact information to her boss and have him call me back, which

43:48.440 --> 43:54.960
never happened, by the way. So later that night, I actually, sorry, when I got back

43:54.960 --> 43:59.400
from lunch, when I was back in my office, I typed out that quick Google Plus post basically

43:59.400 --> 44:04.800
saying like, this is what's going on. You know, an update because I posted probably

44:04.800 --> 44:09.720
three or four times previous after each call and kind of updated everyone as to what's

44:09.720 --> 44:13.320
going on. I don't know how many people actually cared or if it looked like I was starting

44:13.320 --> 44:19.400
to be whining, but I had to get it out somewhere, you know, I just couldn't just let it go without

44:19.400 --> 44:27.120
telling people what was going on. So, uh, I made that post on Facebook and Google Plus.

44:27.120 --> 44:33.000
And at that point I linked to my public Google Plus post on my Twitter account and I cc'd

44:33.000 --> 44:39.760
Toulouse and is that how you say his name? Toulouse? Toulouse? Anyway, that guy and Major

44:39.760 --> 44:43.200
Nelson. And Major Nelson actually replied to me on Google Plus that, sorry, I had a

44:43.200 --> 44:48.000
bad experience. Shoot me an email with your gamertag and your service request number and

44:48.000 --> 44:53.280
let me see if I can figure out what's going on. So I sent him an email the next day. He

44:53.280 --> 44:58.040
said, all right, cool. I'm going to investigate it. And a few hours later I got a call from

44:58.040 --> 45:06.520
Beth at Exceptions Management. She was, yeah, they have an exceptions management department.

45:06.520 --> 45:13.240
So I spoke to Beth for a while. She was amazing, super friendly, super personable, very empathetic,

45:13.240 --> 45:17.080
helps me get everything sorted. She went and got my account unlocked for me while I was

45:17.080 --> 45:20.040
on the phone, waited for me to make sure I could get into it.

45:20.040 --> 45:23.600
Just to make it clear, just to make it clear before, just to make it clear, before you

45:23.600 --> 45:28.520
could get to this person who could actually handle your issue and take care of everything

45:28.520 --> 45:31.760
right there on the spot. It sounds like she had the button. You had to go through Major

45:31.760 --> 45:36.160
Nelson to get to her. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let's step back even further here. They

45:36.160 --> 45:44.000
have a department for people that make exceptions to the rule. What?

45:44.000 --> 45:47.840
I pointed out to her like, you know, this would have been so much easier if the supervisor

45:47.840 --> 45:51.680
earlier could have just taken care of this for me. And she said, no, they actually can't

45:51.680 --> 45:56.160
do that. They don't have that ability. But Beth, who I was speaking to, didn't have the

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
ability.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.360
I don't have the ability to help you. Oh my gosh. Okay. So, so Beth or whoever, finally,

46:01.360 --> 46:04.560
it sounds like satisfies you. Like, you know, what, what, what did they hook you up with

46:04.560 --> 46:05.560
in the end?

46:05.560 --> 46:10.560
Yeah, well, so she took care of me and she was like, okay, well, we're all set. And without

46:10.560 --> 46:14.600
even asking, she said, well, how about, you know, I know you have them for a year report.

46:14.600 --> 46:18.120
How about six months? That's, you know, I think that's what I could really get away

46:18.120 --> 46:22.520
with doing. At that point, I was just so happy that she was willing to help me and all that.

46:22.520 --> 46:26.320
She kind of offered it without me bugging about it. I said, okay, six months is fine.

46:26.320 --> 46:31.360
So she gave me a couple coats for, you know, two, three-month coats to redeem. And you

46:31.360 --> 46:35.240
know, I was happy with that. I got a little something for it. I felt like Microsoft was

46:35.240 --> 46:40.320
trying to appease me at that point. And I was just happy I could get back into my account.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.680
So all's better, right? All's well that ends well, right? We're done?

46:43.680 --> 46:50.760
Uh, well, not yet. Not yet. Uh, we're almost done. So I go home and I play a couple games

46:50.760 --> 46:54.600
online. Everything's cool. Next morning I wake up and as I'm driving to work, I see

46:54.600 --> 47:00.240
I get an email that says, Hey, we noticed you added a new email to your account, which

47:00.240 --> 47:07.420
I did not do. And it's some Oscar hyphen four one eight at hotmail.com or something random

47:07.420 --> 47:12.520
like that. And so, I mean, yeah, I got hacked again, less than 24 hours after this is all

47:12.520 --> 47:15.880
resolved. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

47:15.880 --> 47:19.680
wait, wait, wait. Put the brakes on. Hold on. You, you were out of your Xbox live account

47:19.680 --> 47:27.400
for four months. Finally, thanks to major Nelson, you get back in 24 hours later, 24

47:27.400 --> 47:34.240
hours later, you're hacked again. Yes. So I said, screw this. I'm not talking to Microsoft

47:34.240 --> 47:42.000
again. Oh damn it. Now we're getting the service job. Hold on. Can you still hear us? Oh, hi,

47:42.000 --> 47:47.840
go, go back. Go back a little bit. We lost you for a second. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so I got

47:47.840 --> 47:54.840
the email. I, uh, sorry. Got a, that'll, I lost track there. Uh, let's say I walked in

47:54.840 --> 48:02.000
on my phone to Xbox.com, went to change my password and all that stuff. Uh, as soon as

48:02.000 --> 48:06.920
I got to work, I, you know, delete all my email accounts. I associated my account with

48:06.920 --> 48:10.560
new email accounts, changed my password to something completely new that's never been

48:10.560 --> 48:16.280
used anywhere. Uh, made sure that this person had not made any purchases on my account.

48:16.280 --> 48:20.960
All my points were still there. There was no activity. So I just booted that email address

48:20.960 --> 48:27.880
off my account and, uh, made everything, you know, brand new basically. So far since then

48:27.880 --> 48:32.360
everything is cool. Okay. I have to ask these questions because listeners will kill me if

48:32.360 --> 48:36.720
I don't ask these questions to get some things clear. You changed your password between the

48:36.720 --> 48:43.080
first time and the second time, right? Yes. It was, it was not a brand new password. It

48:43.080 --> 48:47.800
was one that I'd used in other places before. So one theory that I have is that maybe this

48:47.800 --> 48:53.280
traces back to when all, you know, all the websites and Stoney and all that got hacked.

48:53.280 --> 48:58.840
Maybe, uh, they got my password from something like that associated better, but it was not

48:58.840 --> 49:02.640
my same password from before. But it was still different. They, they somehow got two different

49:02.640 --> 49:08.320
passwords a year. Yeah. And I think, I was wondering also maybe they, uh, they hacked

49:08.320 --> 49:12.600
into the email account that was associated with my Xbox account and that's how they were

49:12.600 --> 49:17.120
doing it. Because if you have the email account, you can reset the password, you can get a

49:17.120 --> 49:21.440
reset link sent to that email address. That could make sense. I don't know, maybe they

49:21.440 --> 49:25.640
did something like that or maybe they did some social engineering and, uh, got a service

49:25.640 --> 49:30.120
rupture request to reset it or something like that. But, you know, that stuff happens. I

49:30.120 --> 49:35.200
usually pretty careful with this stuff. Do you think you were phished? Because I, that's

49:35.200 --> 49:39.560
the line that Xbox has been saying is that, well, all these people are getting phished

49:39.560 --> 49:44.280
and I'm like, the fuck I was getting phished. Man, I've been on the internet since I was

49:44.280 --> 49:49.800
11 years old. I didn't get phished. Like I, I'm smarter than that. I don't click on links

49:49.800 --> 49:54.640
that I don't know where they came from. Whenever I get any sort of email that says, hey, we're,

49:54.640 --> 49:58.840
we need you to log in here or something like that, I don't click the link. I open a browser

49:58.840 --> 50:04.880
and I type in the URL, you know, so I'm positive that I didn't get phished. And that's an easy

50:04.880 --> 50:09.560
thing for a company to say, you know, put the blame on the users and make them think

50:09.560 --> 50:11.520
that it's not their fault.

50:11.520 --> 50:16.560
So, all right. So since, since we got to, we got to wrap this up and get back to the

50:16.560 --> 50:21.040
show at some point, but I want to, I want to just kind of summarize here. You were hacked.

50:21.040 --> 50:26.560
You went through four months of hoops. Finally, after getting Major Nelson involved, you speak

50:26.560 --> 50:30.160
to the super secret department of Microsoft who can actually fix things when you talk

50:30.160 --> 50:33.800
to them. 24 hours later, you're hacked again.

50:33.800 --> 50:40.920
Yeah. So I want to, I want to make sure that I emphasize that Major Nelson, once I got

50:40.920 --> 50:45.640
to that point, super helpful. Everything was taken care of pretty quickly. Microsoft just

50:45.640 --> 50:51.860
really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the initial, you know, interactions.

50:51.860 --> 50:56.040
When this happens, they need to be a lot more swift with this, their, their investigation

50:56.040 --> 51:01.000
team, as they kept calling it, needs to be more accessible and they need to get this

51:01.000 --> 51:05.560
stuff done faster because the fact that I had to get Major Nelson involved, I mean,

51:05.560 --> 51:10.440
I felt terrible trying to get his attention on Twitter to get this taken care of in the

51:10.440 --> 51:16.640
first place. But once I did, everything was taken care of. So I don't want to encourage

51:16.640 --> 51:21.280
people to just tweet at Major Nelson when other things go wrong. But I mean, that's,

51:21.280 --> 51:25.640
that's what I ended up having to do to make this work. That's just insane.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.920
Yes. And you know, what else is insane is that I'm seeing, I'm looking in our chat room

51:28.920 --> 51:33.200
at chat.orangetontrader.com and I see MXT is in our chat room saying, I'm going through

51:33.200 --> 51:37.440
the exact same thing that the guy they're interviewing is. This story is crazy similar

51:37.440 --> 51:41.480
to what I'm going through. Microsoft is telling me that I'm not properly verifying the account

51:41.480 --> 51:45.640
details, even though I successfully verified everything to start the investigation and

51:45.640 --> 51:51.760
I've been using the same information. So it's not just you buddy, but Microsoft denies there's

51:51.760 --> 51:52.760
a problem.

51:52.760 --> 51:56.960
Yeah. And I know that you got, you got hacked and I've heard a few other people like I,

51:56.960 --> 52:01.760
I posted one that initially happened, uh, uh, I write for Nukesilla. So I posted a story

52:01.760 --> 52:06.760
on there, uh, basically saying, Hey, I just got hacked. So PSA, you know, I want to change

52:06.760 --> 52:10.800
your password. So I got a bunch of comments on there. Probably half a dozen people saying

52:10.800 --> 52:14.920
the same thing was happening to them. And I Googled around, found a ton of other people

52:14.920 --> 52:18.920
get hacked. So, I mean, it's not an isolated issue. This is something that's happening

52:18.920 --> 52:25.880
a lot. I don't know what the common thread is, but it's not, uh, something that only

52:25.880 --> 52:29.680
a few people are getting hit by. And I've talked to a lot of other people like friends

52:29.680 --> 52:33.320
of mine who said, Oh yeah, I just had to go through that too.

52:33.320 --> 52:37.600
So, so what happens from here? Do you, do you think this is something you can put behind

52:37.600 --> 52:41.200
you in a couple months and say, all right, whatever, I'm a Microsoft fan again, woohoo,

52:41.200 --> 52:46.840
Modern Warfare on my Xbox, pew pew. Or like, has this like permanently damaged things?

52:46.840 --> 52:52.080
It's, I mean, there's, there's definitely permanent damage. Uh, I think it's insane

52:52.080 --> 52:59.240
that Sony got basically crucified for the hacks a few months ago, but I can't think

52:59.240 --> 53:05.000
of a single instance in which anybody actually got, there was any fraudulent credit card

53:05.000 --> 53:09.400
activity. You know, I didn't care if anybody actually losing money over that, but this

53:09.400 --> 53:15.520
is going on with Microsoft and it's widespread and there's no press about it. I mean, people

53:15.520 --> 53:17.760
aren't talking about this.

53:17.760 --> 53:22.800
What can Microsoft do to mend those, make amends?

53:22.800 --> 53:29.000
They need to fix their security holes, whatever they may be, or, uh, maybe send out a force

53:29.000 --> 53:33.260
password reset. I don't know. They need to, they need to do something about it. I think

53:33.260 --> 53:37.260
people need to be talking about this more so that people are more aware they can go

53:37.260 --> 53:41.880
and change their passwords. Oh, one more thing I wanted to add to my story because I forgot

53:41.880 --> 53:47.760
to mention it in the middle of it. Uh, they called me about a month in and said they needed

53:47.760 --> 53:53.040
my console ID and serial number. I did not have that with me, so I called back a couple

53:53.040 --> 53:56.120
of days and gave it to them, but they tried to use that as ammo when they were talking

53:56.120 --> 54:00.080
about how long it was taking. They said, well, we needed the console ID and serial number,

54:00.080 --> 54:05.120
so that resets the timer. And I said, well, you know, that was three months ago, but I

54:05.120 --> 54:08.840
just wanted to throw that in there in the interest of having all the facts.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.400
Fair enough. Fair enough. Still four months is pretty shitty.

54:11.400 --> 54:16.280
Console ID and the serial number. I mean, they probably already have it.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.280
How about look at where he's logging in from.

54:18.280 --> 54:22.600
It took him a month to even ask me for that.

54:22.600 --> 54:26.560
Silly. All right. Well, Justin, I got to wrap up so we can get back to tonight's news, but

54:26.560 --> 54:29.680
thank you so much for calling in and sharing the story with you. I don't know what else

54:29.680 --> 54:34.540
to say. I'm glad you got resolution for Microsoft, but I agree with you. Microsoft needs to admit

54:34.540 --> 54:38.040
there's a problem more than putting the, because what Microsoft's doing here, and there's a

54:38.040 --> 54:41.680
pattern. It's what happened to you. It's what they're saying on the internet. It's what

54:41.680 --> 54:46.000
they're saying to MXT. They're saying the user base is the problem. We're the problem.

54:46.000 --> 54:50.560
We're getting phished. We're causing the issues. We're not providing the console ID numbers

54:50.560 --> 54:54.560
in time. The customer is not right, is what I'm hearing from Microsoft.

54:54.560 --> 54:59.360
No, I did not get phished. I mean, it's definitely something on Microsoft's end. I mean, I'm

54:59.360 --> 55:03.320
still going to play games on my Xbox, but I'm definitely going to be playing more games

55:03.320 --> 55:05.640
on my PS3 as well.

55:05.640 --> 55:09.320
Hey, home just got a renovation there. It's worth checking out.

55:09.320 --> 55:14.280
Well, I was just going to ask now, did you have the same email associated with your PlayStation

55:14.280 --> 55:17.600
network account as you did with your Xbox Live account?

55:17.600 --> 55:19.080
Yes, it was the same email address.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.080
See, so that's the thing.

55:20.080 --> 55:22.840
That's why I was thinking it might have something to do with it.

55:22.840 --> 55:27.700
That's the thing is I think that what they're saying with these hacks is that it's not necessarily

55:27.700 --> 55:31.880
that people are getting phished. I think it's just that people are getting in through their

55:31.880 --> 55:37.200
email accounts. And it's not an intrusion to Microsoft's Xbox Live service. It's just

55:37.200 --> 55:42.320
a different way. So people are getting phished that way or are getting hacked via their email

55:42.320 --> 55:43.320
accounts.

55:43.320 --> 55:47.880
Can I, I have to ask, DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?

55:47.880 --> 55:51.240
Checking my account.

55:51.240 --> 55:55.240
I recommend everybody do the same thing. For God's sake.

55:55.240 --> 56:00.080
Everyone listening right now, log into Xbox.com right now. Change the email address associated

56:00.080 --> 56:03.480
with your account. Change your password and change your security question.

56:03.480 --> 56:07.720
I changed mine ages ago, but not well, not ages ago, but like about a month and a half

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
ago.

56:08.720 --> 56:13.600
Right. Right. So, all right. Well, Justin, thank you again so much. And God, I hope it

56:13.600 --> 56:16.520
I hope it doesn't happen a third time. What else can I say?

56:16.520 --> 56:18.640
Well, thank you very much for having me.

56:18.640 --> 56:23.160
All right. No problem. Drive safe. Oh, wait. Did you want to plug your site or anything?

56:23.160 --> 56:24.160
What's that?

56:24.160 --> 56:27.640
Did you want to plug your site or anything? I don't know if it's appropriate, but.

56:27.640 --> 56:34.480
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Check out Nukeszilla.com. We're actually in the middle of a month-long

56:34.480 --> 56:40.560
review, Nukes-travaganza right now, where every day we're writing a review of a game.

56:40.560 --> 56:44.880
First day, we wrote one sentence for the review. Second day was a two-sentence review. That

56:44.880 --> 56:48.800
was my Pokemon review, actually. Third day, we wrote a three-sentence review and so on

56:48.800 --> 56:49.800
until the end of the month.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.800
It is-

56:50.800 --> 56:51.800
We're about halfway through that right now. Go check it out.

56:51.800 --> 56:55.800
It is blowing up over there at Nukeszilla.com. All right.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.800
Absolutely.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.800
Take care, buddy.

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
Bye.

56:58.800 --> 56:59.800
All right. Bye.

56:59.800 --> 57:00.800
Bye.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.080
Wow, wow, and more wow.

57:03.080 --> 57:07.560
Apparently, MXT in the chat was saying that, oh, my God, they did the same thing to me

57:07.560 --> 57:11.000
as far as asking for the console ID and serial number.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.240
What's that? Oh, what's that?

57:14.240 --> 57:15.640
That they did the same thing to him.

57:15.640 --> 57:17.680
Oh, MXT, really? Oh, my gosh.

57:17.680 --> 57:18.680
But, yeah, so-

57:18.680 --> 57:24.080
Well, I mean, think about it. We don't have that big of an audience when you consider

57:24.080 --> 57:28.880
the entire internet. We have, what, maybe 50, 60 people in chat right now, right? And

57:28.880 --> 57:33.200
the fact that Justin's on the phone and one out of these 50 people is like, oh, yeah,

57:33.200 --> 57:38.400
I'm going through this, too. What? This isn't a problem?

57:38.400 --> 57:39.400
It's redonkulous.

57:39.400 --> 57:44.240
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

57:44.240 --> 57:49.320
But it's the thing, though, is they're right in the fact that, yeah, it's not through-

57:49.320 --> 57:52.920
I mean, if someone's getting access to your email account, how's that their problem?

57:52.920 --> 57:57.280
I mean, that's not their fault that someone got access to your email because you happen

57:57.280 --> 58:01.440
to use the same password that you use with the PlayStation Network stuff, and that list

58:01.440 --> 58:02.440
got leaked out.

58:02.440 --> 58:06.080
To be fair, Justin might have made a mistake if his email password and his Xbox Live were

58:06.080 --> 58:11.120
the same. But, you know, whether he made a mistake or not, the hoops he's going through

58:11.120 --> 58:12.120
is ridiculous.

58:12.120 --> 58:15.800
But it doesn't even matter if those were the same because they can send a password reset.

58:15.800 --> 58:16.800
Yeah, yeah.

58:16.800 --> 58:19.320
But I think they still have to answer the security questions, if I'm ever correct. I

58:19.320 --> 58:20.320
don't know.

58:20.320 --> 58:23.440
I just want to say this real quick. Bobby Blackwell is sharing an idea with me. I don't

58:23.440 --> 58:27.240
know if this will work for you or not. But he says, to help with the social engineering

58:27.240 --> 58:32.780
aspect of it, change address line two in your account to read Xbox support. Do not assist

58:32.780 --> 58:38.720
with recovery. That way, when the folks look at your account and see it, they won't try

58:38.720 --> 58:43.280
to, you know, give- accidentally give out any information or make any changes or whatever

58:43.280 --> 58:47.080
if somebody's trying to get it done that way. So, I find that interesting, an interesting

58:47.080 --> 58:48.640
way to do it.

58:48.640 --> 58:52.620
At the end of the day, honestly, I'm getting to the point where I'm using unique passwords

58:52.620 --> 58:56.440
on different websites. Like, and it's kind of a pain in the ass to remember them all.

58:56.440 --> 58:59.080
But it's like what I have to do. So, anyway.

58:59.080 --> 59:03.200
All right. Moving on. We spent a good 20 minutes on that topic. But you know what? It's important.

59:03.200 --> 59:05.880
And Justin's right. Not enough people are talking about it. And I said that back in

59:05.880 --> 59:09.320
August. I'm saying it now. Like, at least we're finally saying like, okay, well, finally,

59:09.320 --> 59:14.820
we're seeing that Xbox and EA's denying that there's a problem and warning people to not

59:14.820 --> 59:21.160
get phished. I guess that's a baby step. But see, that's the thing, though, is they don't

59:21.160 --> 59:32.840
even- you know, why didn't they just say, hey, you know, back- I mean, another video

59:32.840 --> 59:38.320
game console provider or something like that, you know, was hacked earlier this year and

59:38.320 --> 59:44.680
emails were leaked out. You may want to check that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if

59:44.680 --> 59:51.880
they can't see that because that's, you know, untactful or whatever. But, I mean, obviously

59:51.880 --> 59:58.800
there's something going on. There may be some sort of restrictions for how much you can

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.400
spend in a day or something like that.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.400
I think they need to just do the force password reset. And they don't want to get right through

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.080
the holes like Sony did. They're scared shitless of what happened to Sony.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.760
If they do a force password reset, people are going, why are you doing that? Oh, well,

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.040
because there's a lot of people getting hacked. I mean, they're not going to come out and

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.240
say that. It draws suspicion.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.080
All right, let's move on with news. That took up a big chunk of time, so we want to quickly

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080
get through this.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.880
Real quick, to finish up the whole TV program, we think. So Bloomberg is saying that Microsoft

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.480
is on the hunt for a TV exec to handle the original programming. And they said they also

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:44.320
have some candidates with Mark Graboff and Jess Gaspin, two ex-NBC suits, I guess.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.000
And they're saying that they're thinking the original programming via Xbox Live dashboard,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.160
including like the Major's Minute, Xbox 101, et cetera, and also possible tie-ins with

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.720
like IGN, all that stuff.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.120
Of course, they had MSNBC, so it makes sense to do that. And of course, this week they

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:11.600
had the launch of a few more applications, YouTube, TMZ, Verizon, FiOS, if you happen

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:20.960
to have that, and I believe, was it iHeartRadio, MSNBC, Muzu TV, if you're in some of the European

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:33.480
countries, Rogers On Demand in Canada, SBS On Demand in Australia, and RTVE in Spain,

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:41.880
and MSN Video in some of the European countries, and Blinkbox. All different streaming stuff

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880
there.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.400
TMZ, I haven't even looked at that. I don't even know.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.560
I actually looked at the TMZ stuff. It's similar to the phone app. It's Celebrity Gossip. They

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.440
go out and get the videos, the raw footage of celebrities walking out of famous restaurants

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.920
and stuff. They do a live show that I think is broadcast on Sirius and all that. If you

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.000
like Hollywood gossip stuff, which I don't think many of you do, but that might be a

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.720
way for them to try and reach out to a different demographic.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.240
Here's what I don't like about it, and I think it'd be awesome as if it was actually set

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.660
up like TV. Like you have channels. It would be awesome.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:17.960
It's easier for me to log into a computer and type TMZ.com or hit a button on my phone.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.480
I just don't think the Kinect interface is yet there. If I want to go check TMZ, I don't

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.320
go sit on my couch. Okay. Xbox, Kinect, TMZ, Bing.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.300
I think they should have live TV or something like that as an option. They should have these

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.840
TMZ channels where they have some TMZ shows or whatever they're on at certain times, and

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.200
then you watch it actually like TV instead of having to... Because I think that would

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.000
be really cool, and that would get a lot more people interested in it because it's in addition

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.320
to their own TV. They can actually watch the Xbox TV instead of, oh, hey, look, I can queue

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.520
up all these videos. Yeah, you know what? You can do that with the PC, and I'm sure

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:03.120
most people out there have PCs even if you don't have an Xbox. Why would you bother downloading

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.160
this app and going through all this crap? It's more of a hassle.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.440
Maybe once they have a remote control or something. I just don't think Kinect is as fast as they

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.960
want it to be. They do have a remote control. Do they? Yeah, maybe they have the little

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.240
infrared remotes. I agree with your whole thing. It needs to be channel up and channel

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.920
down or something like that to get to the stuff. It should be like web TV. Well, not

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:31.040
necessarily web TV, but like IPTV or something like that. Speaking of MSNBC, I want to break

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.680
in real quick with some real world news. What is it with world news going on in the middle

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.160
of our show? Because remember earlier this year, Osama bin Laden was reported dead and

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.120
all that. Well, they didn't kill anybody, but Kim Jong Il from North Korea has died

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.720
according to the Associated Press and it's on msnbc.com, which I mean, not to be crass.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.760
I mean, it's sad when a world leader dies, I realize he's a controversial figure. I'm

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.040
just going to stay far away from that and just say, I believe it was reported he was

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.400
having, he had pancreatic cancer related issues. So, you know, and that was the same thing

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:16.000
that got Steve Jobs sadly. So that, um, cancer sucks. That's my point. So there you go. If

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.600
that, I mean, allegedly that's what obviously with world leaders, they're always very secretive,

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:27.360
but you know, there you have it. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, more gaming news. Who's

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.960
going to be making a death night of him in wow. And wow. Yeah. I remember my friend,

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:40.040
uh, from a hoard house. Matt, uh, had rip Steve Jobs already for the big day. All right.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.640
Anyhow, uh, the circle pad is coming out in the U S that's of course the, you know, a

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.840
little attachment for the three ds and extra little thing there on the three ds. However,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.720
uh, it's coming out February 7th, so it'll be out next year. It'll be $20, which I guess

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.800
is a reasonable price, but here's the deal. It's a GameStop exclusive yet again. Nintendo

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.000
has chosen to go the GameStop exclusive route, but this time I don't believe you can get

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.440
it on nintendo.com. Can you? I think you can only get this at GameStop. So if you want

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.760
the circle pad pro for 20 bucks, that will allow you a, an extra pad in resident evil

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.840
revelations, a metal gear, solid three d snake eater. Uh, you got to check that out at GameStop

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.240
only on February 7th. And I got two words for that. Fuck that. I hate this. I, you know,

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.160
you guys all know how I feel about it. It's no secret. I hate that it's all this exclusive

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.000
retailer stuff and I'm not going to support it and it pisses me off. I actually kind of

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.360
wanted that circle pad, but not for the reason you think. Um, I don't know about you guys,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.120
but I've had my hand hurt playing Mario Kart because I don't think that the three ds is

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:48.880
very ergonomically designed very well because like my thumb like starts to hurt from the

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.320
acceleration button and trying to use the shoulder buttons for like a long period of

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.680
time. We have to kind of like hold the a button down. It's not bothered me in any other game

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.840
today. Like it doesn't bother me in Mario three d land. It only bothers me in Mario

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.080
Kart. But I was thinking if I had kind of the extension that that circle pad provides

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.560
that there's a more, more rest for my thumb there and it might work better, but I'm not

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.720
buying it this way. I guess I could import one, but I don't like that idea either. To

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.640
be honest, I guess I'm just going to have to wait for the three ds redesign that will

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.600
release the three ds they probably should have put out in the first place. Yeah, they'll

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:28.080
do a three ds redesign, but here's the thing I, and I suggested this on Twitter. Um, it's

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.600
a peripheral. There'll be third party solutions for it and there'll be probably third party

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.760
solutions. They're even better than it, you know, the official Nintendo one. So just wait

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:43.640
to wait to get it. I mean, um, there's no reason you need to rush out and do it. And

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.240
honestly, you know, before we were like saying, Oh, maybe the reason that GameStop has the

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:56.760
exclusive on, you know, Xenoblade is because, um, they may have helped to pay for the import

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:03.160
stuff, but for the circle pad, ah, I don't think so. I think that it's just, I don't

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:11.520
know, unless I was part of the Xenoblade stuff. Yeah, so I'm not happy about the whole thing,

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:18.760
but I don't know what, I don't know what Nintendo has to gain from this, to be honest, by being

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.000
in bed with GameStop so much. But here's the only thing I can think of. I hate that this

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.680
is a pattern. That they think that this is going to be a niche product and that they

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.200
don't want to save money. They're going to ship everything to one, one source, basically

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:38.640
GameStop, you know, cause they do this in distribution, um, all the time or even their

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.940
direct retail partners is that these companies will, to save money, they will drop retail

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:50.680
partners and make them go through distribution, um, to, you know, drop the amount of locations

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:56.200
to save on freight and just streamline everything so they don't have to ship to all these different

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:02.580
locations. They ship to five locations instead and let them sort it out from there. So maybe

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.840
that's what they're doing with this because they're thinking that they're just not going

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.240
to sell a lot of it. And yeah, I think they're right. They're not going to sell a lot of

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.440
it because it's not a peripheral that's absolutely needed for some stuff, but it's nice. But

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.880
once again, I mean, come on, this totally screams that they're going to do a revision

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.720
of this thing. Yeah, no, I, and I can kind of see where you're going with that. It is

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.440
a bit of a niche thing and, and you know, the developers are kind of in a, in a stuck

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.000
place. They can't really design games to require this, especially now, you know, like I think

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
ever if they're not going to be able to, well, hold on though, because the new Zelda game

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.400
requires Wii motion plus, which really wasn't a part of the week when they do a redesign

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.920
of the 3ds. Eventually I think they could start to require it kind of down the line,

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.000
but I don't think they could, it's going to be a good year or two. I mean, that's how

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
long games take to develop anyway. It's going to be a good year or two before that's required.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.120
I think if they're going to start doing games that require stuff, they better do it sooner

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.120
than later because they want, you know, the least amount of consoles to be affected by

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:07.640
it. All right, well let's move on to Dark Sakura with some news. There's news. It exists

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:19.200
and this one is about Square Enix. The Square Enix members site actually was shut down and

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.040
according to Square Enix, they said that they were actually looking to see exactly how deep

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:30.640
the breach goes. It looks like it was indeed hacked. So they said that it was a server

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.360
that was used by members in the US and Japan and so they shut down the server so that they

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.960
can see exactly what's gone on. They said they can't confirm that there's any possibility

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:47.060
of credit card information leak since that server that was hacked doesn't contain any

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:51.160
credit card information. But they're going to look through it and double check everybody.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:58.520
So if you were on there, your credit card's safe. If not, ain't your problem. So there's

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:07.600
that. At least it's not your Xbox getting hacked. At least nothing was taken. But once

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.960
again though, if you have your email associated with that Square Enix account that may also

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.240
be associated with a console or you may share a password on that site that you also share

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:29.280
on your console, you may think about changing that just to be on the safe side.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.800
So there's been a lot of lawsuits against Sony for different things. One of the more

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:41.640
popular ones is the other OS removal and there was a class action lawsuit actually with Sony

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:53.160
about that. A federal judge has dismissed all counts of the suit. It's interesting though.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:11:00.960
All of the claims have been dismissed I guess back in February. But I guess they amended

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:08.640
their claims and of course they dismissed the amended claims as well. The quote they

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:16.120
have from I guess Judge Richard Seaborg is in light of the prior amendment and the fundamental

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.400
shortcomings in the plaintiff's basic theory that it was wrongful for Sony to release the

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:29.720
software update in dispute, leave to amend will be denied. So they're not allowing them

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:44.320
to amend it again and they're basically dismissing it. So basically they allowed the people to

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:52.280
keep the other OS but they obviously had to decline the update and basically it was well

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.440
within Sony's rights to do that whether you like it or not. I think that's part of the

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.560
reason why you can use your license agreement so they can do that kind of stuff. You know

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.200
it's not what we were saying. And technically you know it wasn't an advertised feature on

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.680
the box even though it was something that they talked about and you know different developer

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.760
conferences and E3 and stuff like that. You mean the little fine notes there but it wasn't

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:22.460
something that they go hey you can run Linux on this because I mean but then again Linux

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.640
on anything anyway. Then again though you can still kind of run Linux on it if you know

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.600
you jailbreak it and give it an amount of time or some more time and jailbreaking will

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.800
probably be legal soon enough and then you can do what you want. But once again they

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:45.680
can also you know prevent you from playing online if they have that ability. Although

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.640
I mean if you think about it it's not only does you know the other OS thing doesn't necessarily

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.320
just stop you from playing online it stops you from playing new games because new games

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.280
require firmware updates that are included on the disk and those updates remove other

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:10.040
OS so it kind of sucks. Damned if you do damned if you don't. I mean just maybe maybe buy

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:16.760
a computer that do Linux instead of actually using you know your PlayStation 3 unless you're

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.280
the military and then you can buy a whole bunch of them just specifically for that but

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.600
it's just either going to be a computer or a game console. They're busy curing cancer

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:34.920
below their game. You can still do the folding at home without having the other OS stuff.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.720
I never used the other OS. I thought about it for a while but just never got around to

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:44.720
it. I have a laptop with Linux on it. What do I need that for on my. Yeah I don't I think

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:50.960
if people are just looking for a reason to have their panties in a bunch. Yeah. So real

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.960
quick let's talk a little bit. Yeah I'm sure we're kind of talked about this during kind

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.800
of what we're playing this week. But yes in case you haven't heard and you happen to have

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:10.260
bought a 3DS early on you're one of the early adopters if you will. You are of course going

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:16.280
to get some more games as part of the ambassadors program. You'll be getting 10 free Gameboy

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.120
Advance games as well and this is kind of cool. Some actually really good games in there

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:27.120
which I was very pleasantly surprised to see. They include Super Mario Advance 3 Yoshi's

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.600
Island, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare Mega Micro Games, Mario

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:40.080
vs Donkey Kong, Wario Land 4, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, The Sacred Stones,

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.140
The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, and F-Zero Maximum Velocity. Some of those games actually

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:49.880
I recently sold with one of my old DS's. I gotta say some of those games haven't aged

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.760
too well either. Because I played the Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero which I love

01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.400
the F-Zero on the GameCube but yeah the F-Zero on Gameboy Advance I guess wasn't that good

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.240
or one of those things you kind of remember more fondly 10 years ago. These games aren't

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.080
that old but still they're kind of showing their age a little bit. Especially the Mario

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.960
Kart. Like it's hard to go from playing Mario Kart 7 on your 3DS to going to play Mario

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.680
Kart Super Circuit because it's like why am I not able to get the nitro boost when I do

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.200
the turn or you know some of that. So it controls really funky too compared to 7. And I gotta

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.360
say Mario Kart 7 man that's a good looking game. I mean the screenshots don't do it justice

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.680
at all or even the gameplay video doesn't do it justice. But man it's just really crisp.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:40.520
But some of the other like Gameboy Advance like Metroid is great. WarioWare is amazing.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.360
You know there's a lot of great. You know the best. Even though it's not in the bundle

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.000
it's still the best. River City Ransom. What on Gameboy Advance? That's right. Heck yeah

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.980
it was really good. But that's not a first party Nintendo game. That's the one thing

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.460
all these games have in common. No but I'm saying that it's a game that has aged well.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:01.100
And hello Yoshi's Super Mario 2 Yoshi's Island which yes I realize is whatever they redid

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.600
it as for the Gameboy Advance but still that's an amazing game. And then also one thing I

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.600
read is kind of a little tip because I know the Gameboy Advance stuff gets stretched out

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.380
when you play it. You can actually hold start or select while you're starting the game up

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.660
and it will shrink it down. Yeah funny enough Kijuno in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.800
says Rob did you play the Gameboy Advance games in small window mode? Yeah I actually

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.920
didn't like it. I just I didn't mind the stretched images. Especially for like WarioWare. It

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.220
doesn't matter. Those games weren't like cutting edge graphics. But I can see where the stretch

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.400
gets kind of yucky on some of the other games. So I get why you can do that. But it's too

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.120
small. Windows too small when you do it that way. Zether in our chatroom is saying you

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.780
know the Gameboy Advance F-Zero is more of a throwback to the SNES games. I thought the

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.600
SNES games control better. I will say though it is interesting to play those games with

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:54.520
the circle pad. Because it works. I mean you know. But we didn't have like a circle pad

01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:00.560
on the Gameboy Advance so it's kind of neat to have that. Yeah. So. Alright. Alright Dark

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.120
Sakura what do you have for us? Well I have some more stuff. This actually has to do with

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:14.760
Ultima Online 2. There was apparently something said by Richard Garriott who was looking to

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.460
talk to EA about publishing a new Ultima Online. He said that they would they would love to

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:28.800
have access to the Ultima property and had discussions with EA about it. But EA apparently

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.960
is not down for that. They've said no we're not. What's he talking about? In fact the

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.040
quote actually says I'm not sure what Richard Garriott is referring to. So it doesn't look

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:45.000
like that might actually be happening. Maybe he's feeling a little bit sorrowful that you

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.120
know Tabula Rasa didn't work out the space thing. Maybe. Not really doing that now but.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:57.760
But there is something about an Ultimate Collector project that does start with Ultima. Hmm.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:04.400
Maybe no. Ultima was a great series though. I would like to see it make a comeback in

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.560
some form or another. I know they have the web game I think was the last big thing I

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.280
saw them doing. But some people are still freaking playing Ultima Online. They gave

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.000
it they gave it a big redesign a few years ago to kind of make it a little more current.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.960
So it's kind of cool. Let's see. Alright let's travel around the world and look at some release

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.920
dates and check out what's coming out to an arcade or excuse me a home console. I wish

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:32.400
it was a tradition arcade but to a console near you soon. Well probably not a lot right.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.400
Yeah. I hope you like Star Wars The Old Republic because that's all that's coming out this

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:47.760
week on PC. Nice. That's it. Alright. It's pretty good. Let's go to Japan and check out

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.280
what's coming out there. Now I do want to point out the Vita is out in Japan. That was

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.080
one of the big releases of this past week. And of course you see a lot of the unboxing videos

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.400
and a lot of stuff. I thought about importing it until I saw the six hundred dollar for

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.640
just the console thing. Oh my God. Like a hundred bucks each. No thank you. All right.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.120
Things are a little more exciting in Japan than just one game this week on the Xbox 360

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.720
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 gets a dubbed version for Japanese release this week. Divinity

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.960
2 The Dragon Knight Saga and Musou Orochi 2 comes in a regular and treasure box edition

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.920
from Koei Tecmo comes out this week on the Xbox 360. That's a is this a fighting game.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.440
I think this is a fighting series. Oh yeah it's a fighting series from Koei. It's probably

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:41.840
like a Dynasty Warriors universe fighter. Orochi has to do with a legend an old legend.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:49.680
What was that was it Orochi? Yeah. Musou. Yeah. I think it might be all that stuff.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.400
On the PlayStation 3 pretty much the same games I just mentioned Modern Warfare 3 Musou Orochi 2

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:05.360
a couple extra games there though. Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011. Need for Speed Hot

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.080
Pursuit gets a price reduction and next week in Japan I got to get this out there because we're

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:17.280
not going to be here next week. The Idolmaster Graver For You Volume 3 comes out next week. I

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.720
know The Idolmaster is like a really big series over in Japan. Going to some of the other consoles

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:29.520
I want to check out at least like the Wii and the Vita. Nothing really on the Wii that I can see.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.800
Oh wait I was looking at the Wii U no wonder I don't see anything there. My name my brain

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:42.720
combined them into the WETA. On the Wii Inazuma Eleven Strikers 2012 Extreme. That's the lone

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.480
Wii release this week and let's see if there's anything on the 3DS or the Vita. Any late starts

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.000
out the gate. Oh yeah Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3. Oh that's a general Asia region release

01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:02.880
comes out this week and quickly let me look on the 3DS. There is a looks like there's a branded

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:09.520
Nintendo 3S a Gundam 3DS. Oh no the SD card it's just the SD cards. Oh no no this is the full 3DS.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.400
Are they SD Gundam cards? Yeah yeah like they're SD cards little Gundam characters and then they

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.880
actually have a 3DS that has. That makes it funny because they're SD Gundams. It was a series SD

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:28.000
Gundam. I gotcha. Well there is a game also to go with it SD Gundam G generation 3D is out this week.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:35.040
SD Gundams are so cute. All right there you go that's your Japanese releases. The UK um on the 20th

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:41.760
Star Wars The Old Republic um and the 21st Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD on PS3. That's it.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.720
Pretty quick series of release dates yep. That's what happens this time of year. All right Loki.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:56.400
All right um man it's always dead this time of year but thankfully though it won't be dead to

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:03.200
along in um first quarter of next year. Nintendo has announced their upcoming release list uh for

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:09.120
their you know titles um hitting the Wii and 3DS and of course on Nintendo DS as well.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.200
Some notable stuff um Kid Icarus Uprising getting a date finally. It's going to be coming out

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:24.720
in March and uh I love how this isn't working. March 23rd um so that's pretty cool. Wish it was

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.640
coming out earlier than that but whatever I'll wait. Um other notable stuff Mario Kart I'm sorry

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:38.240
Mario Party 9 on the Wii coming out March 11th. Also Poke Park 2 Wonders Beyond on February 27th

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.680
also on the Wii. Uh let's see some other stuff. They're also going to be getting um some cool

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:52.800
eShop stuff. VVVVV um for the 3DS will be coming out first quarter next year as well as Night Sky

01:22:52.800 --> 01:23:01.200
and uh Mighty Switch Force Zen Pit Ball and Mutant Mudds and I guess uh Kirby's Block Ball

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.240
is going to be brought to the Virtual Console as well for the 3DS. Um they're going to be

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:13.520
coming out for the 3DS. Um on uh WiiWare La Mulana is supposed to be coming out. That's pretty cool.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.520
And then uh someone tell DT to keep it in his pants. Yeah he's already well aware of La Mulana

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:27.280
coming out. Nice. He's he's on the pulse of La Mulana. Um Rhythm Heaven Fever that's coming out

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:35.360
February 13th on the Wii. That's also going to be $29.99. So uh you're a nice budget price for that

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:41.040
honestly never got into those. But uh and then of course the Circle Pad Pro will be coming out

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.080
around that time. All right well before we get to the classic game of the week I gotta share this

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.320
story that's going around the internet this week making its way on the gaming blogs. Uh a very

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.680
interesting censorship issue going on on the Nintendo 3DS. Imagine if you were Ashton Kutcher

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:04.080
and you tried to name your Mii on your 3DS Ashton. Uh Nintendo apparently is censoring that name

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:10.240
believing that it contains objectionable content. Because think about it Ashton if you spell it out

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:17.600
A S H. Yeah it sounds like a shit ton or um ass ton maybe. I don't know but this. So if you like

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.160
Aston Martin's you can't have one? I guess not. So this poor guy named Ashton I mean it's not

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.320
Ashton Kutcher obviously but that's you know a common use of the name or we would think like

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.440
oh there are people named this in the world. Because if it was Ashton Kutcher that shit would

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:38.000
be fixed. Maybe done. But somebody who also has the name Ashton uh tried to set up he named his

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.560
Mii that and he named his um uh the Mii creator that and it got censored. And he actually shows

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:49.120
there's a whole YouTube video and you can see the YouTube for yourself it's posted there. Uh

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:57.360
it is on user L E Y V I U R. Leave your? Take it or leave your? Uh so you can see this and he

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.440
actually shows his Mii and then he shows what it looks like on his friend's system where it's

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.720
replaced it with a bunch of question marks because apparently the name Ashton is objectionable. Now

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.800
Ashton Kutcher I find objectionable but this poor guy who just happens to have the same name

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:18.240
shouldn't have to suffer the consequence of Ashton Kutcher being crappy. So.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.240
Man wouldn't you hate to find out that Nintendo just suddenly deemed your name offensive?

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.920
It's stupid. I'm offended by Rob. Yeah I feel like you're gonna steal from me. It's like you're

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:36.560
gonna rob a bank or something. Hey well it's good though that they was it for the 3DS they've

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:44.400
patched it so that they can add DLC right? So does that mean they're gonna be able to bug fix stuff

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.920
like this? Well I suppose they could get firmware updates. They could do that in a firmware update.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.080
That firmware update really did kind of you know it was like they changed everything in that

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.440
console. I mean they they overwrote some of the stuff in the the find me thing. They overwrote

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.560
it was a lot of changes so they can they could they could fix it if they want. I know they can.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:09.040
But they're not. No not unless Ashton Kutcher tweets about it. So somebody should send him

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.440
that YouTube. But they could do it though because remember there's issues with Street Fighter where

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.760
it wasn't working correctly or Ridge Racer or something like that. One of the launch titles

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:27.200
was like bugged or something. Yeah so they fixed that. It's sad that you know because we're gonna

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:34.080
get into a story later on but it's sad that that Nintendo hasn't embraced the ability to

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:44.160
patch games. Right? Stupid. Yeah all right let's uh let's take a look at the classic game of the

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:52.000
week. I thought of it in my car. Every week we take a stroll down memory lane because you know

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.280
at one one day you didn't have these 3DSs that were banning people's names. You used to just

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.760
one day actually in tonight's case you used to walk into an arcade and there actually were

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:10.240
arcade games there and not like machines that spat tickets out. Right. So you have to recognize

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.160
the classic games in the past the way things used to be. You better recognize. You better recognize or

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.680
a recognizer will force you to play games. All right so you have to play Space Paranoids over

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.880
and over. Dark Soccer enough set up. What is tonight's classic game of the week? Xavius.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.960
It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Namco and it came out in 1982. You know what else came out in

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:41.840
1982 Rob? What? Tron. Awesome. Yeah it was a game done by Masanobu Endo and uh it was released by

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:48.080
Atari in the US and it runs on the Galaga hardware. But I just have to say I find the um background

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.640
music on this to actually get kind of annoying. I might have to kill it at some point. The um in

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.480
Brazil the cabinet actually says Colombia for the game but the software still says Xavius.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:06.160
So um you use um an uh eight directional joystick to move an aircraft called the Silvelo which has

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.920
a forward firing zapper and a blaster that lets you send the air to surface bombs down for ground

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:19.440
targets. And it's supposed to be set in Peru. So you have to basically just fly around and shoot

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:28.880
shit. It's a shmup. You have 16 areas and it loops back to area 7 after 16 and uh you just keep going

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:37.360
over terrain and shooting shit. So if you complete at least 70% of the area before dying then um like

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.200
when you die then you actually will start at the next level instead. It constantly flies forward

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.680
just like any good shmup. Um you actually can make it through the whole game without killing anybody

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:56.400
for the record. Although not really. Where's the fun in that? I know right? The challenge is not

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:04.720
getting hit. Um it is one of the very I would have to put it in the first of the uh uh shmups.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:11.920
It actually one of an earlier one before that was Caverns of Mars on uh the uh Atari computer.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:20.240
Um it was really really cool. It uses a lot of different um uh techniques for it. It uses palette

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:30.640
shifting for color changes and it's just really amazing. Um they also had a uh a few hidden bonuses

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.920
in it that you could find by doing a secret maneuver. Um one of them was a special flag from

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:42.640
Rally X. And what happens if you find the flag then you um get an extra life. It's in a bunch of

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:52.160
Namco games. Um and the slogan when this came out was are you devious enough to play Xevious?

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:58.320
Oh and then it says the arcade game you can't play at home. I'm gonna play some of the music from the

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:06.320
I'm gonna play some of the music from the um the the newer the newer one. Well

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:15.360
actually there were um pretty big uh music stars in Japan who were big fans of the games. And uh

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:24.240
one of them who was Keisuke Kawata um of Southern All-Stars actually did an album uh that was all

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:32.080
based off of Namco video games and Xevious was the centerpiece one. And then um there was also

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.720
a 12-inch single that had uh liner notes and a science fiction story written by um the creator

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:45.920
um Masa no Blendo uh that had uh it was set in the world of Xevious and had its own language

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:55.520
included. Um there was also a three-part novel written about it called uh Fairdraw F-A-R-D-R-A-U-T

01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:01.520
um but the theory is that it doesn't sound like it was ever released or if it was released it

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:07.200
was really limited release. There were other games that came out in the series. In 84 it was Super

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:16.160
Xevious that was basically the same game just harder and uh Sylvilo in 1991 which was first

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:22.880
person sort of it uses 3D flat shaded polygons and they only came out in Japan. Xevious 3D-G um

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:30.960
in 1995 was basically a 3D textured um on top of polygons and two-player play only in Japan although

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:38.000
I've seen one. Xevious Arrangement in 1995 that was part of the Namco Classic Volume 1 collection

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.480
also included Xevious and Super Xevious. Um Grubda which was a spin-off starring an enemy

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:52.320
a tank with corkscrew treads that came out in 84. Also um new versions for the home system was

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:58.880
Super Veevious Gamp no Nazo in 1986 which came out for uh the Famicom and the Nintendo Vs.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:06.720
I'm sorry why is that versus series um in the arcades. Uh basically there's different riddles

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.480
you have to solve to get through it. Um there was Xevious Fardrop Saga which was um an MSX2 game

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:17.680
and it was done by Compile. Compile does amazing stuff. You can actually uh pick from four

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.720
different ships you have the Sylvilo, the Solgrado, the Zeodally and the Gamp Mission.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:29.760
There's uh Xevious Fardrop Densetsu in 1990 that came out on PC Engine also done by Compile.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:36.800
And then Xevious Resurrection that came out in 2009 for PS3 as a downloadable um with the

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:43.920
downloadable title Namco Museum Essentials or it was called namcomuseum.com to the ends in Japan.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.880
There's also an RTS game called New Space Order that was done by Namco Bandai Games

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:54.800
that has bits of Xevious included in it. For different ports we're looking at the Atari 7800

01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:03.360
Atari um 8-bit NEC PC Engine, the NES, the MSX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II,

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:09.840
Apple ST Home Computer. Everything. Yep. Rereleases like I said there was Namco Museum Volume 2 for

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:19.040
the Playstation which I have the A. Um the Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade PC 1998, Namco Museum 50th

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.720
Anniversary for Xbox, PS2, GameCube. That one's pretty sweet actually. I like that one. And PC.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:33.040
Um it was not in the Game Boy Advance version by the way. Uh Namco Museum Battle Collection for PSP,

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:39.200
Namco Museum DS, Namco Museum Remix on Wii, Namco Museum Essentials for PS3. Like I said earlier

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:46.640
and it was also ported into the plug-and-play um version of Ms. Pac-Man TV compilation for a little

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:58.720
plug-in thing. Um there was also um a uh GBA um release of the NES version on um it was an

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.960
unlockable bonus game for Star Fox Assault and then came out on Virtual Console. Uh like I said

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:10.080
there's just a bunch of them. They tried to do a 2600 version it didn't come out. It was part of

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:18.800
Pac-Man's arcade party in 2010 and uh 3D classic Xevious a 3D uh remake of the game was available

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:27.040
on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS. There's a bootleg version too called Xevious. X-E-V-I-O-S.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:37.440
The U is absent. Oh that makes it a new game. Um but really it's just all they did was instead of

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:50.080
saying uh 1982 Namco it says 1980 Watson and they removed the Namco logo and it's just not very cool.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:59.280
In fact um there's a trick that was in Xevious um that the bootlegger left in that you um get

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.600
a message right at the beginning. When the ship appears you move to the far right edge of the

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:08.800
screen and begin bombing constantly. You keep bombing until the first set of attack rings is

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.560
close to you then you shoot the rings. The message dead copy making copy under Namco program will

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:20.080
appear on the screen as proof of copyright validation and the explosion sounds are different.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.680
As far as differences in the U.S. and Japanese ones um the names in the Japanese version are

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.960
the pseudonyms of the games designers and composers and since uh the U.S. basically let three uh

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.000
characters in it didn't work and the zapper and blaster buttons were reversed between the versions.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.120
There's also references in Ridge Racer you get a car called the um RTXevious Red and the RTXevious

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:52.320
Green uh you get that all three different versions of it and uh one of the in Ridge Racer 3D one of

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:58.400
the unlockable cars is called the Sovalo and it's piloted by Pac-Man. Isn't that cool? Very cool.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.760
How about other references? Good lord there's a lot to this game. Oh yeah we're we're just scratching

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:09.360
we're just scratching the surface in Star Fox. Come on we're getting ready to start Mario Kart. In Star Fox

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.960
Assault it's uh it has basically hidden versions in it. Tales of Symphonia there's an enemy called

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:23.600
Bakura which is one of the invisible flying panels from Xevious. Mario Kart Arcade GP and GP2 which

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:33.200
were co-developed by Namco. Um you also uh one of Pac-Man's uh cars is the Sovalo spacecraft.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:41.200
In Earthbound music from Xevious can be heard um at the Onet Arcade. Um you can actually get

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:48.320
the Sovalo ship um as an avatar on PSN and it will be a downloadable aircraft in Ace Combat

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:56.960
Assault Horizon. There you go. Your classic game of the week Xevious and its 50 gazillion different

01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:02.320
ports and reiterations. I like this one I'm looking I've never played this one the 3D-G.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.800
Yeah I never played that one but it looks kind of fun I gotta say. You know what when I told um Dan

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:12.240
what I picked he's like Xevious is awesome. It is awesome. The other game that I picked though he

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:19.600
was really excited about that so I might have to do it uh next time. All right well uh we're gonna

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.920
take a break we're gonna do Mario Kart again we are uh getting in the oil army room right now

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.920
there's already five of us in there including myself and Loki and Bobby Black Wolf so it's

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:34.560
really it's on it's kind of and Tiger Claw so it's really like All Games versus Zether who won

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:41.040
last time so it's not looking good. Everyone's got a team All Games has each other's back dude

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.440
you are in trouble. That's right you are screwed. They're gonna use a special turtle shell that just

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.600
breaks out of paddle and spanks you. Does Zether have a shell maybe he does and I just I'm not

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.000
aware who knows. All right anyhow uh so if you have Mario Kart 7 hurry up and get in there in

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:03.760

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.440
that's included in the prize including some of the music we played on break tonight for the live

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:36.640
listeners so there you go so pretty sweet um on top of that if you uh like uk developers there's

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:43.520
another indie bundle the uk indie games bundle or the little big bunch um it's also out right now

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:52.400
and this is based of course from uk developers and they includes explode mon odd world munch's

01:42:52.400 --> 01:43:02.320
odyssey and frozen synapse serious sam double d and new star soccer five so and the charity of

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:09.600
course uh choice for there is games aid i'm liking this trend right now these bundles because there's

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.480
the humble indie bundle there's the there's another one the really big bundle or something

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:22.160
like that i bought that one too this is a great trend in gaming right now and then um you know

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:27.680
there was a game called apb it was kind of like saints row online um or granted that online if

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:34.320
you will but anyways apb uh it went freemium and now apparently they've been having some pretty

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:42.320
good success over steam and they're also going to release it as a um a box version that you can find

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:50.160
in retailers uh for 29.99 you're gonna get more than 50 worth of in-game items um as well and um

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:57.920
it's pretty awesome i guess the original game only had 130 000 registered players but they've

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.520
already um you know picked up more than the original audience so that's that's pretty awesome

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:08.720
because a lot of people wrote that game off yeah they picked up three million new registered users

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:14.160
wow three million after showing up on steam and you know from what i played very little of it uh

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:20.640
it's pretty cool i mean it's worth checking out because it's free so why not all right uh let's

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.000
go to some other news you know harmonix put out a new game this year but you might have missed it

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.320
because it wasn't called rock band but it was a fun little iphone game called vid rid vid rhythm

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.960
i guess you can't really call it a game it was more of a wtf it was an application and it was

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.000
like get drunk at a party and have fun making these little vid rhythm well if you want to try

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.240
vid rhythm the good news is it's now free if you missed it the first time around check go get it

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:48.080
it's free now with 12 new tracks and a vid rhythm update 1.1 that happened this week there are some

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:53.920
holiday songs deck the halls jingle bells and apparently pitch correction now so now you can

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:58.160
sound like t-pain i don't know exactly how that works six new video styles in there as well and

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.160
and one more you can export the clips in high definition now so vid of them had a pretty

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.160
meaty update this week very cool seeing harmonix support it even though it's more of a

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.080
wtf kind of application to be honest holy shit what are you holy shitting vid rhythm no a picture

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:19.200
of me when i was 20 that one of my friends just posted wow on facebook on facebook look at my hair

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:28.160
it was long sorry i just like wow you had you used to have pretty big boobies back then

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.280
i've always had an epic rack rob what are you talking about

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.160
you know what's gonna suck is if i do get all knocked up they're just gonna get bigger it's

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.640
true you know zether might have the biggest mario kart e-peen but you'll always have the biggest

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:50.880
hits i do have an epic rack it's not a bad thing all right uh allen wake is coming to pcs in early

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:58.080
2012 uh even though the game's been on xbox for quite some time about a little over a year year

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.680
and a half uh allen wake is supposed to be coming out on the pc finally in early 2012 which is

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.760
interesting because uh i thought the game was originally supposed to be on both and then they

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.880
said no it's not going to be on the pc well now it is actually coming on the pc both download

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:16.240
content the rider and the signal they're going to be included in the pc version for free possibly to

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.120
make up for a little bit of lost time uh interestingly enough this is time to be right

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.920
around the time that the allen wake xbox live arcade game or allen wakes american nightmare

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:29.840
is supposed to be coming out on xbox live arcade so kind of maybe trying to get the name out there

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:36.000
a little bit again before the xbox live arcade expansion uh connectimals i find this interesting

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.560
you know this is one of the big titles on connect well connectimals has come out on another platform

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:48.320
on another platform it's coming out on ios i think that's i think this is very interesting um maybe

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.800
something we should talk about in a more extended segment but uh connectimals is coming out on the

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:59.360
ios platforms this is just a port of the windows phone 7 version but it still goes without saying

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:05.200
hey microsoft didn't just put out the xbox live application on ios this is now extending to some

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:11.680
of the games and sure connectimals is meh whatever but for two dollars and ninety nine cents you can

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:18.000
now i get this and it comes with i guess five cubs for the 360 games i guess you gotta link them

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.160
together somehow or whatever so very interesting also you know why i think this is interesting is

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:28.720
because there's been a lot of calls for nintendo to do something like this right the investors

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.760
really want nintendo to be doing this and they've really staunchly refused but microsoft has now

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.320
shown that they're not afraid to do it now granted they get a little more out of it with the whole

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.080
windows phone tie in but i mean they put it out there it's kind of like they acknowledged hey

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.160
if we don't put that on ios too we're selling ourselves short a little bit they kind of gave

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.200
windows phone an exclusive window they put it out there first but they kind of gave in and did the

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:59.040
ios system i just it's not like microsoft and apple doing things together is completely unheard

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.000
of right remember the gasps heard around the world when microsoft word was announced for the

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.040
max that was years and years ago when steve jobs first came back to apple but um it's still

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:13.040
interesting nonetheless very interesting to see this happening be curious to see if sony or

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:19.440
nintendo ever does anything in a similar vein anyhow moving on dark sakura wow i found pictures

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:25.200
of me when i was four okay oh i was a cute kid damn it it's still cute what happened

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:33.280
don't make me throw my microphone at your ass since you're facing the computer so there's

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:40.160
going to be a lego lord of the rings no one curr hey i curr all right maybe not and there's going

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:48.240
to be toys next year now that's cooler yeah you know what i want a lego palace this makes me happy

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:56.720
sonic cd on xbox live yay it'll be five bucks rock of ages going half price major nelson said

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:02.400

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:10.640
both soundtracks we will have the japanese as well as the american soundtrack trying to will be on

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:18.240

missile fury and gun wage are five dollars apiece and rock of ages is down to five bucks as well

everyone needs to get sonic cd and radiant silver gun yay sales i love the japanese soundtrack

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:44.880
i love the japanese soundtrack for sonic cd so much but then again just not the same without

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:53.040
sonic boom and oh yeah there was other news shit sorry i was all you know excited over

01:49:53.040 --> 01:50:00.480
sonic sales and stuff there's a new pokemon game that's a crossover with nobunaga's ambition what

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:10.400
yeah it's true when i think about pokemon i think about nobunaga's ambition so do i um i always

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:16.400
wondered when these two games go great together make the pikachus go out there's a website to

feed the troops and a trailer and it's set for 2012 release on the nintendo ds in japan and uh

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:33.360
i am going to uh post a link to this on our uh tumbler meanwhile the rest of the internet's like

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.840
universe shits their collective pants

all right is that it that's it all right uh all right we're gonna get back into some long form

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:52.240

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.600
game olr uh a little later in the show first off though loki you know i was gonna mention uh

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:10.320
remember earlier i said that i don't like people sending me invites or i'm not gonna accept any

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.160
invites that people send me for the sim social when the fuck this in aol instant messenger start

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.280
like posting on your fucking facebook wall saying i've been idle since blah blah blah time

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:27.360
blah blah time i don't fucking care if you haven't been doing something in another app so hide all

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:32.880
that i hate that it's posting like what's news articles my friends are reading i'm kind of like

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.160
on yahoo my friends know that i can tell like that they're reading all these weird stories like

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:41.280
maybe they're reading a few too many stories about lindsey low hand you know and i'm kind

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.360
of judging them a little bit well i i want to make sure that shit's not happening just

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.040
acts like you don't realize it's happening you know what i mean you got to be careful uh go

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.960
through every now and then and check like what apps have access honestly it's what you got to do

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.800
yeah all right um anyways so let's talk a little bit about uh club nintendo and this is kind of

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:04.240
cool because actually i've never really registered stuff in club nintendo and i started yesterday so

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:08.640
i had a bunch of these old games i just went back through you know like excite bots and shit like

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:15.120
that so i just added almost everything although i can't find my box for my 3ds um and definitely

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.760
don't have anything well the we would have been too early but don't have my 3ds box which is kind

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.600
of sad because i'm missing some points there might be a work but um you can use those points for

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:31.680
other things other than buying useless garbage that they have on their e-shop stuff um hold on

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.080
there's necessarily e-shop but you know the free shit they give away i don't really need a mario

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:43.040
notepad or something like that but uh you can buy uh games virtual console and we wear and e-shop

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:51.840
games including uh this first round of games all um either 100 or 150 coins for 100 coins on the

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:57.600
we you can get mario super mario kart on virtual console and this is only good until january 10th

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:04.480
so if you want to use that then go ahead and do that if you don't have the game um for the uh we

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:14.480
wear you have fluosity and uh that's 150 coins on the 3ds or ds i believe it's a 3ds you have um

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:25.600
the 3d classic xevious for 100 coins or mario versus donkey kong minis march again for 150 coins

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:34.720
and um it's neat but yeah there's not really i was kind of disappointed at the rewards it's

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.080
an interesting way to get you to spend some of those coins well you know like you can get some

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:44.400
pretty meaty things for more coins like there's the game and watch ds game and we we got a statue

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.760
yeah from club nintendo did you that's um like all the major mario characters that's cool

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:53.360
and the little statue i don't think my level is high enough to get any of the really cool rewards

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.360
but i've been trying to put like i put in my code for the to have in 3ds and getting the two games

01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:04.000
i got because i i thought i heard something about the kid icarus 3d will be free if you register two

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.520
games on club nintendo this winner well i've already done that so yeah me too so i want to

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:13.760
make sure i would get that between mario kart 7 and and the mario kart 3d land so i'm kind of

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.440
disappointed though that you can't and and here's the other thing i don't like about the registering

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:21.520
the games yeah it's cool that we register the games but i don't like fucking filling out that

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.840
survey yeah it's kind of like especially you should notice how you get a damn survey for

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.080
each and every like stinking like nes game and probably now the game boy advance games are all

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.640
gonna have a survey on there too i kind of think it's no i i haven't seen surveys for any nes games

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.240
they want to make sure that they're still releasing stuff of good quality so do you get

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:43.200
coins for buying like stuff on the e-shop um yeah if you do the survey on them i think you do i

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.280
didn't have any surveys well i haven't purchased anything on the e-shop yeah check it out once you

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.160
do i think i think they do get get some stuff there so it'll be cool i got surveys for the free

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:58.800
shit by the way the information is up on our tumblr now the link to the uh pokemon plus

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.600
nobunaga's ambition i love that jigglypuff's on the cover like she's gonna sing the armies to

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:10.480
sleep what is okay what is looking like to me okay from what i can tell is that every human

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:16.080
character has a pokemon partner i guess they're doing like digimon like this one guy in purple

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:22.960
armor has a mewtwo and the girl she's all in pink she has jigglypuff and this one's got okay so you

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:28.240
see and then i think whoever he is is the guy catching them i'd be more interested in the dynasty

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:35.440
warriors mario crossover fucking we need to know armies of goombas with you know we need to do a

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.400
list list so i didn't schedule one tonight because i knew we had the interview it would take about

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.520
a bunch of time but we need to do list list some night like crossover emotions yeah i feel like

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:46.000
we've done that before random japanese crime it has to be japanese franchise random ass japanese

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
crossover game we want to see i think that would be a good one dude we have time for that anyway

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.200
no not tonight we still had you after birth and all that so we're that interview was 20 minutes so

01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:03.280
anyhow um moving on that was 20 minutes shut up shut up well uh you'll lose a lot more than 20

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:08.080
minutes if you hit this bug here um did you hear about this there's that zelda skyward sword

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:14.080
apparently you could catch yourself in some type of like error where if you complete a quest in

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:19.760
the wrong order and then talk to a guy you can like screw things up i don't know but apparently

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.280
nintendo on the support page for legend of zelda skyward sword says you can actually send in your

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:31.840
save file to be fixed nintendo apparently will also be putting out a program that will repair

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.520
the save data if you have your we connected to the internet so it's like a patch but not really

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.440
so yeah i guess you could catch yourself in some type of because they can't patch

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.880
yeah they can't patch but they're going to put out some type of fix so there you go you could

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.920
also you could send in your safe you could send in your we and get your game fixed fuck if you

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:59.200
screwed up so just i would read the internet and figure out what you need to do to not screw it up

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.200
or don't try to break the game because i think you kind of have to go backwards a little bit

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.960
to make this happen so i don't know all right we're going to now see if anybody can break our

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:15.920

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.760
dark soccer read some emails we have two two yeah that's a pathetic showing of emails well

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.040
one's from rob all right well he's pretty cool he says i got my answer from the consumer protection

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:34.720
um they said they can't give legal advice even though they are under an attorney general's

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.200
office then again i didn't ask for legal advice simply information their answer seems to say that

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:45.600
this is not codified in law in maryland my advice for these nasty eulas is if you feel the need to

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:51.200
sue microsoft or sony is to first try the arbitration then dispute it if the settlement

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:58.080
is unfair i think you just got a form letter back dude that's the form letter okay last email

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:07.200
sorry hey olr crew so i hate to be the guy that sends you yet another silly youtube link okay

01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:12.720
rob get ready to pull it up but i found this to be worthy of a quick watch maybe my sense of humor

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.600
is completely sick and perverse but i'll be damned if the kids in skyrim aren't annoying

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.880
little bastards every now and then this just proves every now and then every is this another

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.440
goddamn arrow to the knee clip i don't know this just proves i'm not alone i think loki in

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.680
particular will get a kick out of this okay i'm linking it to hold on i got it i got it is it from

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.960
okay i see it here we go it's probably the killing children mod or something all right here we go it's

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:43.360
called yep killable children is what it's called so let's see here ew it's playing an ad i don't

watch no ad with ugly people all right hold on add add add well grandma was a hottie.com

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:57.360
yes that's what the ad was for now you know the type of stuff i watch on youtube okay here's the

01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.360
real clip

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:14.080
you shouldn't talk to strangers this kid gutted with a fire sword oh look i just

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:30.720
i just killed a little friend here look at this oh my god that's terrible that's awesome

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:35.920
i've seen this video before run away from me he just i didn't even know you could decapitate

01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:42.720
people ah you rush the dragon i stay i kind of want to go back and play skyrim again and

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:51.600
just kill everybody be careful agony i keep hands on the ground wow yes sorry in all seriousness

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:57.200
though i'm a huge fan of the show and have been listening for over six years i listen on and off

01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:01.760
throughout the week while working and you three managed to put a smile on my face no matter what

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:08.880
the topic is even if we talk about child killing unicorn stabbing decapitating their mothers face

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:15.760
melting yes i wanted to ask you how you have kept the show going on for so many years alcohol

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:24.480
i have known countless groups bands organizations etc that start off strong but lose steam and

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:29.680
eventually die due to apathy how do you guys manage to push through and deliver week after

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:36.400
week after week after a whopping nine years what keeps you motivated and do you guys ever have

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.840
major disagreements or even fights regarding direction no never you want to see the show go

02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:47.440
in the future just want to see behind the scenes gossip for a rabid olr fanboy take care and happy

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:56.720
holidays tonic vision um first of all i'm never the same person every day so it's because of my

02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:02.400
innate womanness that i will change personality all the time you never know which pokemon she's

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:09.200
carrying around um robin i go to disneyland that helps i i don't know that's i i i honestly don't

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.840
know how we've managed to do this for nine years but you know we we we had a pretty good skit it's

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.560
funny you're asking this now because we had a pretty good scare this past week that it might

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:22.800
end very suddenly there there was a realistic possibility for a minute there that this could

02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:27.280
have been the last i was still gonna try the skype thing no wouldn't have been the last or a lot i

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:34.480
know i know i know but the last olr as we know it you know and i i have my issues with the skype

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:39.520
thing i know horde house kind of does it but you know just this show is good enough for horde house

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.120
this show has worked because we haven't changed a lot since the first day and i think are you

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:52.240
shitting me we've changed quite a bit but we've had nine fucking years to change we've evolved

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:57.520
yes evolution we've evolved into raichu at some point along the way but no really i mean you know

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:03.840
i thought we were jolting on we slowly evolved into the whole uh um you know general video

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:08.240
gaming when we used to be about ddr and it was a lot more i found that the show had absolutely

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.880
no fucking structure back in the day like if you listen if you listen to early episodes migraine

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.680
the first episode and was like asleep in that chair if you listen to the first few episodes

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.720
we really would just be like we're just gonna kind of like fuck off for three hours and talk

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:26.480
about topics because you know to as much as i hate inflating travis's ego on this show

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.880
that's kind of how i learned to do it on understation live is we kind of like had that

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:35.200
same approach or it was like well we know we're going to talk about xyz tonight and somehow we'll

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.000
do a show and it it were i'm not knocking travis at all he does a beautiful show and that's iron

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.960
finger yeah that's that's how i was raised so to speak but at some point along the way when we made

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:53.840
the switch into podcasting like i think suddenly when we took a different approach in making the

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:59.840
to-go edition and then suddenly it was like okay we've gone from having 50 people listen live

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:06.560
to having 2500 people downloading our podcast it was like shit something's working over here maybe

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.520
we should like try mixing it up a little bit and it's it's kind of worked having the structure

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.800
hasn't been such a bad thing but yes there's structure but there's still huge amounts of

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.040
spontaneity yeah and a lot of that is directed by you guys in the chat room and i hate to sound

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:27.360
mushy yucky frilly fuzzy but it's my foot in the trash the chatters to a big extent and our live

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:34.880
audience and the interaction that we do get on the show me is sure is hugely motivating i mean

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:40.640
for real like i i will be flat out dead honest there was i can think of one night in particular

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:45.600
when i was ready to walk in here and say i'm quit i'm done i can't do this show anymore one dude

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:52.080
but well no that was a different time but there was another time where i i just and i couldn't

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:56.560
even tell you exactly when it was it was a long it was a long time ago it was it was during the

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:02.240
garage years i remember that and um it was like one of the see it was probably around that same

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:06.160
time when remember the computer went down yeah mid show and i had the big diva fit i think not

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:13.360
long after that i was ready to just fucking quit and within a short time of each other we had the

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:19.680
listeners chip together to buy a new computer and i got not one but like two emails that were very

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:25.520
kind of personal in nature about like you know just what i've kind of put out there on the

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:29.200
internet being like kind of open about the fact that i'm gay and you know in a relationship and

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.200
all that stuff and and that it kind of gave some people that were struggling with coming out

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.160
like hope and that like means like so much like i was just like floored and i was kind of like

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:44.160
i fucking can't leave yeah i'm in this too deep now that they keep bribing us with food

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:51.920
and games and happy things inevitably it'll it'll have to end someday nothing good lasts forever but

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:58.800
what else am i going to do on sunday nights i i'm serious about lots of alcohol no i'm

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:04.800
kidding it's it's seriously become like a part of my life like it's it's it's my routine like

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.800
the nights that we don't have olr for whatever reason i'm sitting there at home sunday night

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.200
going this feels weird you know what to know what most of the time we still end up hanging out

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.400
anyway we have a lot of the times we get a pink berry we're like hey we don't have this show

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:24.160
tonight let's go get pink berry and then we talk about the show literally the last time the last

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:27.040
time we didn't have a show that's exactly what happened was that the night the internet kept us

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:32.000
from doing a show yeah so i was like and we went to breakfast that day because dan was watching

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.800
a stupid football so we're like let's go get pink berry later okay who's to show up no stupid

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:43.680
which was funny because not 15 minutes after we decided to call it my internet came back up

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:51.280
although it did end up going back down an hour later so i was like what the hell but we went

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:59.520
ahead pink berry and talked about the show we talked about 10 year stuff yeah which by the way

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.400
you need to work on that girly as soon as you get past all the other stuff one thing at a time i

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.520
know i know but seriously we i i i need to talk to you offline about something because i don't want

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:13.920
to say anything on air but you need to work on that because people are making travel plans

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:18.240
because i kind of let it slip to somebody like there might be something happening at such and

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:24.400
such place at such a such time really i'm booking my ticket right now shit now it has to happen

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:31.040
well because i can't let this person down yeah well it's it's gonna be a busy couple of months

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:37.440
because also a mutual friend of ours is graduating fun in may all right so go to their graduation say

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:43.680
have fun in the real world bye and then get back on planning the 10-year party oh yeah all right

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.960
i guess that's kind of a big deal that's a big deal all right so um but you know i also think

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:56.480
that part of it too is that just with how crazy like i know i lost my job but you guys know how

02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:04.320
miserable i was before you know having the show gave me something to mark my weeks because

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:14.160
i really was just like what am i doing oh yeah i have the show and it really kept my my level

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:19.440
of consciousness of what was going on around me up instead of just falling into i'm depressed

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:28.880
um a lot of stuff that's like for instance um i got to go to e3 like five times you know i don't

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:32.000
you know it's coming up later in the show i don't know if i'll ever get to go again but

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.680
because of this show and some of the contacts i made and friends i made i got to do that at least

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:40.480
thank all the listeners for something you guys have been with me through some shit i got married

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:48.240
doing the show i graduated college doing the show i've moved a few times i've gotten promotions

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:54.880
while i've done this show i got laid off while doing the show i mean big major events in my

02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:02.640
life went through a lot too on the show you know and i moved a few times i've had the same fucking

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:09.280
job for 10 years well you're you're mr stability well but i i can't complain i'm very happy with

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:16.000
where i'm at my day job and shermy has pooped live on air we've had a lot of neat the opportunity

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.360
things like i want to say like the whole unloud stuff that came up last week like jamie getting

02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:24.560
to do that design thing and me getting to try the on-camera thing and and in some ways succeeding in

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:29.040
some ways falling on my face that would have not happened if it weren't for the show i mean i

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:33.600
probably would have met seg anyway because he's a he's a friend of somebody i knew from college but

02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:38.880
it would have never but he's such a sweet person it would have never come to that without this show

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.000
you know he's so nice and i was more than happy to do the work and which by the way guys you'll

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
get to see what it looks like um as soon as we get finished the move because i'll be updating

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:54.480
my portfolio nice so um but yeah um loud was great and i i'm sorry i missed it the other years but

02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.720
you know last year i had a final exam that day which this year um my teacher let me get out of

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.840
my group project and do it early so that was that was cool he was like that's a big event you go to

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:12.400
that that's a big thing to you and also one thing i have to say that i've learned a lot of skills

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:20.000
doing the show you know definitely definite communication and a big lesson that i learned

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:28.000
is the the skill of no one cur seriously like remember that first like couple years and get

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.680
you see she's go back in in the kitchen and i'm like oh yeah the itunes reviews that said like

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:37.520
you know dark soccer needs to shut up and get back in the kitchen yeah i remember that one you're a

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:44.560
bitch so thank you yeah i i you know what i was upset for like five seconds and then i just

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:50.880
realized these people don't know me and the same skill works very well in real life all right yeah

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.360
we gotta move on with the show but wait wait i gotta loki you've been strangely quiet you okay

02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:07.600
you just you know he's sobbing no i i was i was uh i can get you i do love you loki what i said

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:14.160
i can get you neither get me too this is what i love about loki we'll be sitting here talking

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:23.280

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.800
new studio all right uh let's go back into some gaming news so we can get some calls here in a

02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:27.360
minute uh loki i like that darth spazinator says if looking go one show without hacking something

02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:33.600
or ranting someone should check to see if he has a fever or something yeah i'm in hack mode all the

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:43.520
time all the time he's hacking your life as we speak uh you mad okay so capcom is releasing a

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:51.040
capcom digital collection it includes a bunch of um you know xbox live arcade games basically it's

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:58.400
coming out for 40 bucks and it includes 1942 joint strike by commando re-armed two uh final fight

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:06.640
double impact flock rocket man axis of evil and also with the dlc it came from uranus and uh

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:14.240
super puzzle fighter 2 turbo hd remix super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix and wolf

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:24.480
of the battlefield commando 3 um all those available for 40 bucks um now correct me if

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.640
i'm wrong but i thought that one of those games at the very least i believe final fight double

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:36.640
impact required you be to be connected to xbox live in order to play it on register you know

02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:41.360
registered because i think that was playstation network that was playstation network they didn't

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.120
have that i think it's been a while maybe this is where chat can help us out maybe i can't remember

02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:52.080
but i thought that would be interesting if you know if it required you to play online that'd

02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.880
be interesting well maybe they changed that yeah maybe but anyways it's about 100 bucks worth of

02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:04.240
games for 40 bucks so good deal i guess if you don't already have them so i have at least a few

02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:11.920
of those awesome all right well uh we were talking a little bit ago about e3 and uh this kind of goes

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.480
with that and kind of part of the reason why i joke yeah i probably won't be going to e3 anymore

02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:23.840
unless loki helps a brother out but um e3 passes have doubled in cost and i know what you might be

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.440
thinking you might be like wait a minute you don't pay to go to e3 doesn't everybody go to e3 for

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:32.320
free like you register and you prove you're in the industry well yes for the most part most

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:37.360
everybody you see at e3 got in there for free because either they are tied into the industry

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.600
they um are in the media as a lot of the people obviously they are in kind of like the

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.600
not just the gaming uh the people that make the games so the people like purchase the games like

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:51.600
loki's industry distributors and all those people retail a lot of the folks that go but you also get

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.240
sometimes people that want to go because they're exploring getting into the business or students

02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.560
or you know people that are kind of like exploring what type of business possible business ventures

02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:10.080
they can make and this is why e3 sells expo passes so to believe it or not this whole time you could

02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:16.400
really pay to go to e3 you could just say i'm exploring the industry or i'm a student wanting

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:22.640
to kind of get into this or whatever and you can pay and the prices used to be uh let's see it was

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:28.880
400 was last year's price if you registered before a certain date and 500 if you registered at the

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:35.680
door for three days you know it's expensive or you can say i'm sin bad or you could say you're sin

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:42.640
bad i got nothing to do today however the news is this year those prices have shot way up they've

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.760
doubled now it doesn't sound like they've doubled but they've doubled they multiply them by two and

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.680
then subtract five seven hundred and ninety five dollars before the deadline for a three-day pass

02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.880
nine hundred and ninety five dollars you might as well say a thousand dollars for a pass to get into

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:05.840
e3 after april 23rd um so i mean that kind of sucks for people who want to explore like

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:11.680
i i'm not i'm trying to figure out why e3 is doing this my thought is they're trying to maybe

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:17.040
cut back on the people because there's some you know blogs and things have joked about this is

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:22.240
that well you're paying all this money to wait in line and i i have to agree like i didn't well

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:28.800
we didn't we didn't go to e3 last year remember that dark sakura we went to e3 we went into the

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.440
lobby yeah we hung out and like we got freebies from the lobby people were kind of looking at us

02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:38.320
like where's their badges but we didn't go in into e3 itself but we were in the convention center

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:42.240
kind of between the two halls and i held a ds street pass with people so we're just kind of

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.760
like hanging out between and honestly i don't feel like i missed much i mean yeah there were

02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:53.920
some big announcements didn't you get a wiimoto no i didn't get me a moto i think uh me or shane did

02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:01.760
so he he got the me somebody did maybe bobby did but yeah i don't think it's worth that

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:07.840
much money to go stand around and wait in line i mean it would it would kind of like you know

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:10.960
i don't know it would suck if you've gone all these years and then suddenly you can't go anymore

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:16.320
like i know bobby's probably doing a lot of like how am i going to get an e3 this time because

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.400
unfortunately the media standards they do this weird measurement where they're measuring your

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:25.760
website traffic well if you're a show like us they're looking for so many hundred visits a month

02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:30.160
which we would hit easy on subscriptions we would easily hit i'm sorry they're looking for like

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:33.760
thousand but we would still hit that on subscriptions because with four shows a month

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:36.800
and everything we would hit that number on the subscriptions that people download our podcast

02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:40.320
but that's not how they measure it because they're looking at who's visiting the website

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:44.320
and because our website doesn't really have a lot of cutting edge content on it

02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:46.560
i mean well what if our website was the rss feed

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.680
i that might i don't know if it would work or not we'll see unfortunately the website

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:59.200
fuck-ups last month might damage that and i don't know but i don't know it's whatever arbitrary

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:04.400
scale they want to use and i i get what they're trying to do like it was so easy for somebody to

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.600
just start their own website and get 20 of their friends in e3 under that website i feel like they

02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:14.080
did have to draw the line somewhere but i think they drew it too far out that us indie people

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:23.840
kind of get fucked you know anyway i say that we uh do a commando entrance and say that we're

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:30.480
worth modern warfare all right so good luck getting into e3 if you don't belong to a website

02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:36.800
that gets so many thousand hits a month anyhow moving on happier news dark sakura maybe not

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:46.480
vita we've got vita mens um no actually not really um what is going on with the vita they

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:51.440
are actually getting rid of the instruction booklet guess what apple did it first mean or

02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:58.880
neener um they're actually having digital manuals that you can access in game for each of the games

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:07.440
so um it puts people like me out of the job that like printing um but you can still design online

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:13.920
stuff uh yeah i could still still do pdfs and everything i mean that's not a big deal but

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:20.320
they're basically going to be um doing in-game manuals well it's still kind of yucky though i

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.720
mean i i don't know i'm i'm torn because it's like how many times do i really read the instruction

02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:28.160
manual well it makes sense because they're already creating them anyways because they're offering all

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:33.360
their games digitally as well as at retail so if they're already creating those digital things why

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:38.880
make them printed but then i think about back in the nes days like the manual to the legend of

02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.440
zelda that kind of like told the story in the first few pages so that was awesome i miss that

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:48.400
kind of shit but i i get it like now i don't i don't really bother reading manuals i mean look

02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:53.760
at skyrim skyrim came in with a foldout map that it's made to look like parchment and shit hmm i

02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:58.960
mean they still would do that kind of stuff like i remember like my copy of grandia that had a cloth

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:07.920
map you know they still do amazing manuals and stuff in japan here not so much even in the old

02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:16.160
days wow so i think it's just i mean i understand yeah it'll save some money but in the end it

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:21.360
really detracts from the product i think but then again apple did that when they released the iphone

02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:27.760
no instruction manual remember that's true it just had a how to hook it up all in their bookstore now

02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:32.400
you can get a full manual in the bookstore but you don't need it yeah there's a video of a

02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:40.240
three-year-old using one sending text messages but i'm just i'm just saying you know it's not a new

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:46.000
thing cloud cleveland in our chat room says gotta save those trees you know what for every tree

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.040
that's cut down in the united states three more are planted i think i i i have a feeling it's a

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:58.560
little bit tongue in cheek that comment i know but i it's not an excuse i it's it's a cost saving

02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:03.280
measure is what it is that's what it is let's let's be real it's a cost saving measure it costs

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:06.880
money to print those books and they decided they could save money on getting the game out there by

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:12.400
just getting rid of the books and putting it's true i mean i i understand and i agree but i mean

02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:20.320
it's putting a whole but it's it's the end of an industry of printing it's sad yeah but of course

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:25.600
well if you think about it though jamie i hate to say it but a lot of printing industry is going

02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:31.920
digital i mean look at i love the smell of ink i know but and i think there will still always be

02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:36.960
demand for things like movie posters advertising still big and all that but like look at things

02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:43.680
like you know the new york times is on the freaking ipad now and that's how people get it

02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:47.440
but you know what i think that the whole thing about the print industry in and of itself is

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:54.000
turning more into a specialty market because there are now a there's a resurgence of um quality

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.080
magazines if you know what i mean that are like artsy magazines that are like nice thick paper

02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:07.200
and done in a certain size those and they charge quite a bit for them but they know their market

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:13.360
they're the people who are print files and or look at look at look at the stuff you had to do

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:16.640
for umlaut there's a lot of like design shit that people don't even think about like somebody made

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:20.320
the badges somebody made the photo background somebody made the you know uh flyers somebody

02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.040
made you know there's a lot of stuff i did the digital ones too you know so i mean

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:30.480
as see that's why well there's also people who need to design game covers

02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:35.440
that's true do you need to do the layout on the back that will never go away that's not gonna go

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.640
away that's why i get really irritated when people buy a nice expensive box set and then they just

02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:44.880
throw the boxes away it's like do you realize that someone put work into that just think of

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.760
some of the great covers we've had in gaming like the original mega man cover

02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:54.400
well well here's an example for you remember rolling stone used to do the top 100 album

02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:01.120
covers of all time do we have that anymore do they still do this well of all time no because

02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:06.800
they already made it well i know what you mean though once you have to be somebody like lady

02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:11.600
gaga for people to get excited about your cover because you're doing something like like the

02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:18.320
bitch is a bike what yeah but i mean it's it's really that i think that people are really stopping

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:24.640
are taking their design for granted they're so used to seeing something that's well done and

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:30.480
clean now as opposed to the shit we had in the 80s that it's all being taken for granted and

02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.920
then you have to think about you know like the manuals all of that is somebody someone's got

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:41.200
to design that you know and yeah it's cool to have it you know digital because then you can have it

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:48.880
in color you have to pray you know pray please pay for four color process which is expensive

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:55.920
but at the same time you know i think it's it's really sad it does take something out of

02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.040
an entire industry all right i know that's i would be the only one in this house that would go off on

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:07.360
that all right just a couple more stories for you guys i like the smell of ink shut up and then

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:12.240
we're going to get to the skype line at 1877 game olr and the twitter at twitter.com slash

02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:21.360
olr but first loki yes um so let's talk a little bit about um my favorite discussion topic

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:32.320
skylanders and i said before you know you guys are only encouraging them i mean if

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.160
anyways so activision they're taking skylanders a little bit further they're branching out onto

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:43.760
into an online world if you will with skylanders universe and what skylanders universe is going to

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:50.960
be it's basically like um the free realms thing that they have for sony online it's basically a

02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:58.400
world where you can go purchase a piece of the virtual skyland and customize it however you want

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:03.360
along with a skylander character and i guess it's filled a bunch of different little mini games and

02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:11.120
stuff like that and they're gonna have constant updates to go along with it as well um no word on

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:17.520
integration though with the actual characters although i would i would imagine that they're

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:25.440
going to have something like that or you know i see a button that says rental so obviously they're

02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:32.480
charging for something but um i mean seriously guys just i hear so many people going wow you know

02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:39.040
this is like i've always wished for something to interact with you know my games and stuff they

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.360
come with these you buy these toys okay they're little figures they don't do anything at all and

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:52.960
i mean if call of duty were to come out with some little green plastic army men that did nothing and

02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:58.800
they would charge eight dollars for you know each dlc character people will find the repo fuck marvel

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:05.920
versus capcom 3 when they were charging six dollars per character for dlc people bitched like

02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:11.920
crazy saying what the fuck you expect me to pay six dollars for a fucking character that was on

02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:17.680
disk hey you're paying eight dollars for a character that's on disk with you know skylanders

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:25.760
and guess what you keep buying them so they're gonna keep releasing them so i have you guys to

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:30.320
thank for that thank you people that got all fucking nostalgic about it because guess what

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.360
when next call duty comes out you're gonna be fucking paying eight dollars for whatever a gun

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:42.640
you're gonna get a little plastic gun i sense you're really upset about something it's just

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.760
annoying it's just like people complain about the prices of why are they charging so much why is

02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:54.080
there so much dlc for for these games why am i not like getting only half a game at the buy the rest

02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:58.400
in dlc it's because you're willing to pay eight dollars for a fucking plastic figurine that does

02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:05.040
nothing to play as a character in a game and not only will you buy one but you'll buy tons of them

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:10.720
that's why they keep selling you fucking dlc for your games because you're a fucking sucker that's

02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:15.920
why you will buy whatever the company puts out even if it's for a franchise that's brand new

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:22.880
that's pretty much nothing to do with spiro at all zero there's a character that resembles

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:28.000
spiro it's not really spiro anymore and then a bunch of other tertiary characters that really

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.760
take the forefront and that's it i love salacious pop's comment in chat room if it didn't cost like

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:38.800
380 to do it it would be awesome to hold an olr drive to surprise loki's tyke with a fluke

02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:49.200
skylanders rig for christmas what a cruel thing to do to loki you wouldn't care he plays with

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:59.840
he tried to eat he tried to eat the toys all right one more story for you guys here uh and it's about

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:26.000
this is an interesting trend in mmos lately and god damn i hope wow doesn't go down this path

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.880
although i would say the 25 amounts are kind of pushing it and i i have yet to buy a 25 dollar

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:37.280
amount i never will steed right now i never fuck that steed no but here's the thing um like other

02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:41.760
mms was doing this i remember bobby was talking on his show because he he's dabbled in eve online

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:46.800
i think or he knows people that are playing it and um they had the whole monocle thing that was

02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:52.000
being sold for like 60 bucks like it's just but some people in order to really stand out in a

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.680
crowd and have the biggest epine will pay that money i mean think about it why was there so much

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:03.520
internet rage about people getting into that star wars the old republic game different times this

02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:08.400
week people were pissed that they weren't first that they couldn't have the first level 50

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:13.440
character although let's be real nobody that was complaining about it is going to be the one to

02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:17.760
have that first level 50 character you know the person that has the first level 50 character

02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:24.240
is probably a group of people that are pushing their way to it you know just just to have the

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:31.360
biggest pain you know what i mean yeah like people will do pay anything to get ahead and have the

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:40.320
biggest pain yeah and i'm sure that thing sold quite a few cars probably not a ton but enough

02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:48.160
to make ea probably do it again we're just sad remember that app that when you know the iphone

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:54.160
first came about and they had an app that was like five thousand dollars or some shit for

02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:58.560
sparkling diamond thing that spun around and that's all it did yeah people bought that shit

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:06.400
too because they're dumb and and i'd like to point out once again how stupid skylinders is

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:10.960
take a look at this picture of spiro from skylanders he looks like he got fucking kicked

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:16.560
in the teeth and some teeth got knocked out and he's like raging now i don't know it's just

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:24.480
really stupid looking he where did his teeth go it's kind of i mean seriously he looks so derpy

02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:33.120

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:39.440
do what take a nap shush did you just call in to troll loki tonight uh yes but uh i do have other

02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:44.560
things i can comment on okay everything yeah yeah tell us about the e3 thing you've been e3 eight

02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:49.440
eight how many freaking years in a row 18 years in a row or something crazy 15 years 15 years in a

02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:57.120
row and i paid 75 to get the exhibits only pass in 97 my first year oh my gosh and so now it's

02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:04.880
five dollars for the three-day expo pass wow it's got it it always has gone up and like 400 was a

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:09.360
big jump because i think the last time i had paid i was like it was still like 150 or so

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:16.080
it's a 200 and but what i think is going on is that they're really trying to keep people like me

02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:22.720
out because i've you know about half of my e3s have been free either through the media or through

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:27.360
my industry or through software development credentials or whatever um and the other half

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.240
have been free and i always had that to kind of fall back on and what they're i'm gonna kind of

02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:36.720
equate it to something that's uh i don't know if they've got these type of toll roads out in

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:42.240
california but they just opened one in georgia where they increase the price to dissuade people

02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:48.720
from using that lane on the road there's one lane it's an hov pass they just started those in the

02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:53.440
bay area the whole fast track carpool lane where it's like you yeah depending on how many cars are

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.760
in it the price goes up during certain times of the day yeah yeah yeah so i think e3 is trying

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:02.560
to do the same thing they're like well if these bloggers that really shouldn't that we don't feel

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:07.040
have a right to be here are willing to pay the 400 let's see if they're willing to pay the 800

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:14.000
and there are there is probably people that will say no that's too much and uh you know if they're

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.160
not a legitimate business they can't write it off as a business expense or anything like that

02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:22.240
so what they're trying to do is they're trying to limit the amount of people that they don't think

02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:27.200
should be at e3 from still getting into e3 because that's been the dirty little secret is as long as

02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:34.800
you're over 18 you could pay and it didn't matter what your job was wow and you know you it didn't

02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.200
matter what you did if you gave them the money they gave you a pass and said have fun all right

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.600
just it just it just kind of stinks that some of us who you know have been trying so hard for so

02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:48.240
long kind of you know get the shaft and you know there's some there's some people that do get those

02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.480
numbers that kind of look down on the rest of us and say well just try harder but it's kind of like

02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:58.960
well it's it's it's tougher when they don't get what we're doing and that i'm not here to create

02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:04.160
a website you know what i mean right and they don't mind because they've got enough people

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:09.040
doing coverage that do have websites yeah and a lot of podcasting networks someone like you know

02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:14.560
all games gets passes you know they've got enough and you know some other podcasting networks

02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:20.000
basically they just pool all together but the individual shows themselves don't exactly have

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.480
the website visitors unless they've got a vibrant community that they've built up right and

02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:30.800
unfortunately you know just our situation is kind of unique with the chat room and the the live

02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:35.680
streaming and then the podcast and stuff and there's just they don't want to deal with it

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:41.120
you know they already feel they allow too many media in and so they're not going to change

02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:45.200
anything they do so i'm not even going to bother with the media pass this year i'm but see what

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:50.320
they've done to me is the way i got in last year was through my day job because i'm a software

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:56.400
developer and yes we actually do work on ios stuff and i have done gaming you know gaming

02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:01.600
exploratory stuff with my day job so technically i'm a game developer right and that's usually

02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:07.600
good enough well apparently they've kind of updated their industry rule and now they actually

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:12.800
check your company's website to see if you publicly have ties to the gaming industry wow

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.800
and since we don't have any completed projects our website just talks about the real estate

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:22.080
websites which is our main revenue it says nothing about the gaming so if i i'm afraid

02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.200
if i i mean i'm still going to try to apply and send my w2 and the tax id and all the stuff that

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.760
i need that i was eligible with last year i'm going to send it in and but they may look at the

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:37.920
website and say you're not in the gaming industry wow it's like they're paying all these people to

02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:41.840
investigate who's going i mean i i kind of get that something's got to give because the

02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:47.120
show has a lot of people there but at the same time there are a lot of people that shouldn't be

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:53.600
there right but in order to keep them out they also have to get some of the people that probably

02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:57.760
do have more acclaim because a lot of the companies there do believe i should be there

02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:03.600
but it's not up to them who gets invited to e3 it was at one point yes and i got in those years

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:10.880
yeah yeah funny enough my first e3 was thanks to friends of konami yeah so it's it's in fact

02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:15.040
dark soccer could say the same thing i think and for a couple years was kind of that went into ddr

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.880
because well because we were all while doing ddr oriented stuff and you know konami was really

02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:22.880
pushing those games when they came out those years so they definitely wanted to see us there

02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.960
but it's um you know and uh we were there the year beatmania launched in america and obviously

02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:31.600
they knew that that would be a big thing we you know we tried to get the word out but unfortunately

02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:37.360
uh just wasn't it's time so so i mean and that's what it is and i'm not going to sit here and qq

02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:42.160
over you know not getting in to go to go to e3 or something or it being a little bit too expensive

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:47.840
or something um you know but it but it does you know from a personal level it does kind of suck

02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:52.560
because i've gone every year right right it kind of sucks and there are people that i see there

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:57.760
that i only see once a year and to me e3 is more about the people and not the games i actually

02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.200
talk to more people and network more than i actually play games unless it was 2007 when only

02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.440
like two thousand three thousand people were there and i actually played a lot more games what's

02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:14.240
gonna happen to our disney trip i don't know i'm sad remember we went to we went to we went to

02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:36.960
he really works hard on his show and it's a great show and it's kind of like a i always kind of call

02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:40.960
it like an npr style show because it's just him talking about games but you know you can hear his

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:45.680
voice when he talks to us there he has a great radio voice and you know he really kind of thinks

02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:49.920
about the topics he's going to talk about and so he's kind of able to sustain the show himself

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.000
and then yet interact with the chatters he kind of does like part one and part two and in part one

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.120
it's him and in part two it's the chatters and uh he does a great job so definitely listen to the

02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:05.200
show and we're happy to be on the same night same network as him let's go to the phones and take

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.320

gosh it is way past your bedtime young man talk about it's five in the morning oh my god well

02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:30.720
thank you for staying up late listening to us good heavens well what did you call in to talk

02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:36.640
about tonight there's a there's a couple of things uh your really big bundle is actually the indie

02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:43.760
royale and they have the xmas bundle up now which includes the black world trilogy remastered eats

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:49.920
dino d-day and the oil blue just in case you're interested also going back a little bit about your

02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:56.480
about the peripheral for the 3ds nintendo have been doing this for years remember the n64

02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:05.520
they had the memory expansion slot which also you needed for uh zelda uh oh god the horrible one

02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:14.640
the horse mask yes the nintendo have been doing this for a long time that's true nintendo always

02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:18.560
just kind of put out these extra little things and then suddenly the game requires it later on that's

02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.840
that's very true nothing new for nintendo they did the same thing with the um uh uh what the

02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:28.880
hell was i talking about earlier the um we we with the we motion plus did the gamecube do anything

02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:31.520
like that i don't think the gamecube did i think that's the one system that kind of stayed

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.240
consistent i don't remember i remember they had those wave birds were awesome the wireless

02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:42.080
controllers but that was that's all i can think of there it just seems every generation they tried

02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.600
to do one thing they did they had the game boy advance cable but there were so few games didn't

02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:53.040
they have like a network thing yeah fantasy star online used it that's it uh maybe one other game

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:57.520
mario kart land that was a that was a the warp pipe or whatever it was called that was a terrible

02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:02.720
terrible thing nintendo did putting that out there and then just never using it so you know

02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.960
i catastrophic maggie since you're calling him from the uk i've got to say it it's you must kind

02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:12.320
of laugh when we bitch about how we're having to wait all this time for xenoblade to come out over

02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:18.640
here because nintendo's been fucking over you guys for years with her releases huh that's one of the

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:23.280
weirdest things who'd have thought nintendo would ever release a game here first except you know

02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:29.520
maybe tingle tingle rpg we never i don't think we ever did get that tingle rpg no we didn't i don't

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:36.960
think so that's sad it's tragic loki had it pre-ordered and everything oh yeah totally uh no

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.960
did he have his pre-order for his costume as well at the same time i i wish i wish yeah and

02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:47.040
unfortunately they cancelled that too i'm sorry shame shame

02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:53.600
shame talking about that though the funny thing is you're talking about manuals

02:46:54.720 --> 02:47:00.160
uh in the uk though i mean you said japan japan gets better manuals than you but in the uk most

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:06.640
of our manuals have always been black and white even when um you get nice color manuals we just

02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.760
get cheap black and white ones you get the seven cent copies from kinkos whereas we're having to

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:17.120
deal with the the uh or as we get the color ones that's that's great man you guys been getting the

02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:22.080
shaft on your releases for years why is that why do you guys have to wait and then you don't even

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:27.760
get the nice manuals the probable reason is because europe has a lot of languages

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:36.720
that's true we get we usually get really thick manuals with 10 different languages also in it

02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:43.280
well few pages for english french german blah blah blah you know what's interesting even here now all

02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:49.040
the nintendo games usually have their manuals in three languages uh english french and spanish and

02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:54.000
i'm assuming that's because they they do a lot of big north american region launches so they have

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.040
french for the canadians and spanish for the mexicans but it's just interesting just trying

02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:05.680
to save money i guess i guess um one last question sure i remember a few years ago you were going to

02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:11.840
do a euro a europe show and it got cancelled at the last second it did and we ended up starting

02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:17.840
the marathon show we did a couple months later at noon are you ever going to do another are you ever

02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:22.640
going to plan another europe show i'm sure this late is not good for my health i'm i'm i think

02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:27.440
we're gonna have to at at our friend's request we're gonna have to do another uk show so we need

02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:33.760
to do another marathon shows i'd be absolutely thrilled to well um we did mention a little bit

02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:39.520
about maybe maybe we should do something earlier in the day on new year's eve may wait no we're

02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:43.040
not doing a show new year's eve it's new year's day new year's day at this one no so we want to

02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:50.320
do a show later trust me yeah well because i'll be hung up now i don't get hungover but um we were

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:54.240
we were definitely we had talked about it we definitely wouldn't mind trying something like

02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:58.160
that again if the schedules work out yeah i'd love to do another marathon show at some point

02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:05.600
um and do more of like the live gaming and playing the games so sometime in 2012 for sure early 2012

02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:13.680
so that's good okay can i ask you a question sure because i want to be sure that i could i have this

02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:23.200
thing about placing accents so do you live in the north oh yes yes i do awesome well it's either

02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:55.920
okay uh we got a tweet from cloud cleveland that links us to a story on screwattack.com

02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:01.440
that talks about game gadget system wants to be ipod gaming oh this is kind of neat it looks like

02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:08.400
somebody's changed like a typical ipod to put a little kind of like what looks like a little um

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:14.400
i guess you could say a ds like the bottom half of a ds kind of turn it into one of those

02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:19.920
they call it an open source game system from the uk-based company game gadget and it's called the

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:26.000
game gadget 1.0 the press release doesn't appear to say a lot but let's go to a quote from jason

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.480
cooper who created the game gadget quote game gadget has been designed with the ultimate goal

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:35.680
of playing every game on a single device just as the ipod was for music hundreds of thousands of

02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:40.800
games are currently archived and no longer being enjoyed by gamers with no value being generated

02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:44.960
for the developers and publishers the launch of game gadget creates a market for gamers to play

02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:49.280
the games that want to play uh that they want to play the game gadget game service just like

02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:54.000
apple's app store allows the owners of these games to remarket their back catalog in their original

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.280
format set the appropriate pricing and gain incremental revenue but with no additional

02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:03.680
investment okay so i get it so it's not actually like an ipod it just kind of looks like one with

02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:07.680
its its plugins and stuff and they're just trying to build like an app store for games

02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:15.360
um i it would be interesting to see if they get the buy-in because i don't know if they're going

02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:24.480
to actually get the buy-in on that so all right um i need to reopen the skype line because i

02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:29.280

02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:19.360
year we got to make it big hell yeah all right bye all right all right all right now i am closing

02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:24.240
skype anime jam session.com it's also check out the podcast while you're there if you're in anime

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:28.960
and i know he he wants to be humble considering the situation not really promote the podcast but

02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.440
he can promote both all right quickly let's try to close out some of these tweets um

02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:40.240
i gotta say a couple tweets about the xbox live call earlier um people in the same situation this

02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:46.160
one from sj100 matt this story on olr just now scared me into changing my xbox live accounts

02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:51.280
password to email address to it change yours or you might get screwed i say up a good advice at

02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:56.480
least you know you're going to be better off also from sj100 matt here's an ask orange launch radio

02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:05.840
question which is better waffles pancakes or french toast rank them it depends on where they're

02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:11.600
from but i will take my favorites of all okay number one is the french toast at sam's kosher

02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:18.240
style deli you've had it i have it's epic number two are the banana cream uh waffles

02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:24.800
at um charlie's that's across the street from my neighborhood and number three um

02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:35.440
i guess i hop um pumpkin pancakes loki pancakes would definitely be dead last that's a toss-up

02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:42.240
between waffles and uh french toast because it depends where you go actually terrible or good

02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:49.440
in its own category should be waffle house waffles just saying uh for me waffles are way up here

02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:55.360
number one waffle waffle waffle way up high and then below that pancakes and french toast i gotta

02:58:55.360 --> 02:59:01.120
i gotta rate french toast last i'm sorry don't get me wrong it's still good and i'll never pass on it

02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:05.040
unless i'm like not feeling well but remember the sweet potato pancakes that we got that didn't

02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:10.240
taste very sweet potato oh yeah maybe they have some sort of unholy turducken of like pancakes

02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:16.560
waffles and french toast you know where you like take french toast and like the the monty cristo

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:23.120
of breakfast food like yeah you like take french toast and you maybe like put some waffle batter

02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:31.840
with french toast made of challah and we stuff it with a crispy waffle filled with pancake i

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:35.760
love salacious pops comment and chat what the fuck is this sophie's choice shit

02:59:38.240 --> 02:59:46.000
agree think how it feels for us uh stirlock says it's a tweet vita shuts out the blind

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:51.360
you can't use the buttons in the menus therefore making the system completely unusable for us

02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:55.920
really i'm trying to think now see i haven't seen the vita or look at the interface at all

02:59:55.920 --> 03:00:01.680
so i know i know he's talking about it looks like bubbles blind is it because since you can't use

03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:06.160
the tangible buttons and obviously a blind person can't see the touch screen or know where to touch

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:10.080
yeah they're that's why they're screwed yep because you can't use tangible buttons well that's messed

03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:18.240
up sony needs to think about everybody hopefully in a patch i mean i have seen handicap accessibility

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:23.600
happen in patching not that that's gonna be a great answer for right now because that doesn't

03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:27.760
because that doesn't look good for the us launch but hey you know what we say buddy

03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:32.880
vote with your wallet if you can't play it don't buy one alan is telling all about you

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:40.960
ooh what oh did i eat waffles with nothing on them yeah i like i like plain i was like tell me

03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:46.080
i do the same thing i burn them to a crisp and then i fuck yeah burned oh so good but

03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:51.040
know what i've been doing lately though is just screw the you know scrutiny sort of like utensils

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.440
you just pour a stack of four waffles you pour syrup on the top a ton of syrup on top i don't

03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:01.280
even like syrup oh i love syrup yeah enjoy my stuff man it's it's fucking good it's not that

03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:06.480
i don't like it peanut butter too much like why peanut butter waffles are fucking good like i do

03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:12.160
like all that stuff don't get me wrong but it's just you know i especially after i got sick a few

03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:15.760
years ago i feel like i can have the taste of it without adding all that stuff but i'll tell you

03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:21.600
what there's one thing that is perfect by itself waffle house chocolate chip pink uh no chocolate

03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:28.160
chip waffles extra crispy they are like eating a giant cookie all right i got i got to get to

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:32.080

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:42.400

what it sometimes tastes better when you don't drink it with a straw thank you see loki this is

03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:42.320
why we get along dan never uses a straw see when he is given a drink to go he takes off the lid and

03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:47.920
the straw and drinks out of the cup amen dan you rock i however like straws for every damn thing
