00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, December 11th, 2011, an official Xbox Live app shows up on Apple devices.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
One of the Operation Rainfall games is announced for release in Europe, and Metal Gear meets

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,640
Bayonetta in a new game trailer.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,860
We are live tonight with the 438th episode of our show on this December the 11th of 2011.

7
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,740
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as she always does week in and week out, say

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,720
hello to one of my co-hosts, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Roar.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Roar!

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
How are you doing?

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Roar.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
You are a beast tonight.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I am.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Roar.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
No, I'm doing-

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Oh, now you're a sexy beast.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm always a sexy beast.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
Except, you know, I'm really not.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
I was today.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,840
Talking about your outfit on Thursday, which we'll get to in a minute, that was, you were

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
a little bit of a sexy beast.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
I like that outfit.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
Oh, thank you.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
You were rocking the flower in your hair.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
I like that.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
Even though my makeup got all screwed up by the end of the night.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,680
Alright, we'll come back to Thursday in a minute, but first I've got to introduce the

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,320
other co-hosts who's here week in and week out, always find fast food dining when it

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,160
comes to six o'clock for our show.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,120
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,800
It wasn't, it was out of necessity because all the other places had longer lines.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,440
Oh, and the fast food choice for tonight is?

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
McDonald's.

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Alright, which does not service-

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
That's not food.

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
It's, it's, it's-

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,520
Does not service an official endorsement of the program by any means.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,800
No, I want, I am not endorsing McDonald's, that's for sure.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,520
No, I've been actually trying to shy away from McDonald's, but the problem is on the

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
way to this show, it's like, okay, you've got Carl's Jr., Burger King, and McDonald's

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
and Carl's Jr. had a line of seven cars.

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,540
I didn't want to go to, I just decided not to go to Burger King cause it's kind of hard

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,000
to get into that parking lot, out of that parking lot.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But-

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
These are real problems, people.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
And I had Burger King for like the last two days, so, you know, but they're chef's choice

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
burger, man.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
It's good shit.

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,200
That is some good stuff.

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,480
This however, not good stuff, and this would be the double quarter pounder that they made

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
completely weird.

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
What?

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
No McRib?

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,520
Dude, the McRib is nasty, okay?

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
McRib is not-

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
No, I know.

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
The McRib is nasty.

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
But it's all everyone ever talks about.

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,760
Have you actually ever read the nutritional information on that?

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
No thank you.

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
That's because there isn't any.

65
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Ha ha.

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
No, it's, it's there.

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
It's just not very nutritional.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,660
Alright look, I gotta, believe it or not we're a podcast about video games and live show,

69
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,840
not just food.

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,880
But let me introduce the chatters.

71
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,440
I have to introduce of course our chat room, the lovely folks that join us week in and

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
week out live.

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,400
Because of course we are live at All Games Radio, which we are every Sunday night at

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,200
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,780
And if you want to join us in the chat room, just point your browsers to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,720
Or of course if you have an IRC client, you can get on that way too by connecting to the

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,600
Game Church network and it's Channel Orange Lounge, but most people just prefer the easy

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
way out.

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
So there you go.

80
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Choose whatever way you wanna do.

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
Come talk with us.

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,560
And some folks in there are talking about retweeting the show status.

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Good, good, good idea.

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,440
Thank you for helping to promote the show.

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Appreciate it.

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,720
And then MPRA2 is saying, well, back to Battlefield 3.

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,960
Sorry, OLR, I gotta unlock fire extinguisher for my jets.

88
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,640
So I guess we lost out to Battlefield tonight.

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
That makes me sad.

90
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,480
A lot of people have been playing Battlefield.

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,960
I always go on to see what everyone else is playing.

92
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Very tempted.

93
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
A lot of times I see Saints Row.

94
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,920
I could go play some Saints Row, but Skyrim is, I need to do meaningless tasks in Skyrim.

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,840
Well, I was gonna say, no matter which friends list we're talking about, on my 360, everybody's

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
playing Skyrim.

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
On my PlayStation 3, everybody's playing Skyrim.

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Like it really is...

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
Nah, last night it was all Battlefield 3.

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,780
Do you know what consistently, again, between the two systems is number one though?

101
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,640
What I see people on more than anything else on the systems?

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,280
The answer's easier than you think.

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Modern Warfare 3?

104
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Netflix.

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,760
Ah, yeah.

106
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Even though...

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,880
Well, let's talk about this a little bit.

108
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Let's get into games a little bit.

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,780
Talk about the new Xbox remodel that happened this week, because they launched the new Xbox

110
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,780
dashboard.

111
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,040
What do they call it?

112
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
The Xbox dashboard?

113
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Is that what it's called?

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Experience?

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Experience?

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I don't know what it is.

117
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
It's technically a dashboard, but...

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
So I guess what they're trying to do is they're trying to...

119
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Call it boring.

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,520
Well, they're trying to integrate Kinect more into it, and have it be that way, but...

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Whoopty shit.

122
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Here it is.

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
Long story short, look, if you have a 360, you've probably already seen it.

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,280
The entire internet was trying to download it that day, and it was delayed, et cetera,

125
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
et cetera.

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Everybody's seen it by now, but I gotta be honest, eh...

127
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
It's prettier.

128
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
I'll give it that.

129
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,120
The ads kind of stick out a lot more.

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
I noticed that too right away.

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,080
But it's really built for the Kinect, and I just think it's kind of eh...

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Not a big fan of it.

133
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,660
I mean, the Kinect's cool and all, but I don't want it shoved down my throat, and I kind

134
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,800
of feel like this new Xbox redesign kind of really shoves the Kinect down your throat,

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
and like, I don't know about you guys, but in my apartment, the Xbox is not always that

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
res...

137
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,960
Or Kinect and all that is not always that responsive, and I don't wanna use it.

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
I mean, it's fine if I light things up to play Dance Central or whatever, but in my

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,960
low-lit apartment otherwise, I don't like to try and use Kinect.

140
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,320
I understand people, you know, think it's cool, and by people like me and Microsoft,

141
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,480
think it's cool to have voice commands and Kinect commands and stuff like that for all

142
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
the stuff in there.

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,560
You can wave your hand back and forth to scroll through the pages.

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,480
Or I can take less time, a fraction of a second less, to move my thumb slightly to the left

145
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,320
or right on my analog stick to do the exact same thing.

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,640
It's just like...

147
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I don't understand...

148
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,640
I mean, yeah, you gotta support the Kinect, and that's fine that you wanna add more connectivity

149
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,960
to the dashboard, but I just...

150
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,320
I think it's unnecessary, and it's kind of a step backwards for a lot of things.

151
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,600
It made a lot of stuff a lot harder to find.

152
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
I mean, there's pros and there's cons.

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,360
On the one hand, it's really easy, like if I think of an old game that's on my Xbox that

154
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,720
I wanna play, like let's say Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, I can go play that game, which

155
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,440
maybe I haven't played in a long time, but otherwise, kind of digging through my collection

156
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,200
is a lot of key presses to get to, because you have to kind of scroll over.

157
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,880
It does kind of like that, it's a crossbar but not really thing, where I just...

158
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,520
It's weird.

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
I don't really like...

160
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,020
I mean, it's prettier, but in practicality, it's kind of an annoyance.

161
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,480
I think a lot of stuff's harder to find, although you have Bing if you know what you're looking

162
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
for.

163
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Bing does not search the internet.

164
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,560
I think a lot of people assumed, because Bing is like a competitor to Google, that you'd

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,600
be able to like Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, and you get taken to our website, but now

166
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,640
no, if you try to Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think you get anything at all, because

167
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
we don't...

168
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,320
The icons that used to be up on the marketplace have been long gone.

169
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,800
The all games icons, they took down when the avatars launched, so you can still use them

170
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
if you have them.

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,680
Rob, you made me laugh just now.

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Why?

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
What'd I do?

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Magic the Gathering.

175
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,840
I don't know why I was thinking about that game the other day, and I'm not even talking

176
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,560
about Magic 2012, but there's like an older one, and I don't know.

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Actually, here's what's funny, actually, on that kind of same note, like how this whole

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,680
thing has broken the Xbox, I tried to play the older Magic the Gathering game, because

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,000
I bought that first one that came out on Xbox Live some time ago.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know why.

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Sometimes you get a bug, and you just want to play a certain game, right?

182
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,920
You play shit tons of classic games.

183
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Why?

184
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,620
Because you think about it, and you're like, I want to frickin' play that game.

185
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,680
So I wanted to play the Magic game.

186
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,600
So I go, Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, and it finds it, and I go, okay, I'm going

187
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,040
into the game, and it launches the game, and it says, you need an update to play this game.

188
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,760
This update is no longer available, and it clits the game.

189
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,400
So this game I bought for ten bucks, maybe a year ago, like I can't play anymore because

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,440
they decided to remove the update, is like this trying to force me into the 2012 version

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
of the game.

192
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I don't even know.

193
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
That kind of irritated me.

194
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Technically we could get you the update, but I mean, it's still a pain in the ass to do

195
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
that.

196
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
It's just me meaning, you know, download it from the internet, but I shouldn't have to

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
do that, right?

198
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
That's right.

199
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
It should just work.

200
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,240
So anyway, I kind of think the new Xbox experience will end.

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
The whole reason I brought it up in the first place, going back to chat, and chat reminded

202
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,960
me of this, is that they took out the party feature from Netflix, which is kind of one

203
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,040
of the deals that people really loved about Netflix on the Xbox 360 is that it had the

204
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
party mode, and of course they're not really saying why.

205
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,880
And this just kind of further down that spiral of, boy, Netflix had to make a lot of unpopular

206
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
decisions this year.

207
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,960
And I'm not saying it's necessarily their fault, because I think they're feeling a lot

208
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,640
of pressures from movie studios and things like that, you know, as movie studios are

209
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
finally realizing, oh shit, the internet really is the wave of the future.

210
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,900
They're kind of having to adapt to it.

211
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,480
So I'm thinking the movie studio is probably pressured into removing the party feature,

212
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,960
because it never showed up on any other console.

213
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,400
Yeah, because if you think about it, oh, I want to watch a movie with my friends.

214
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,520
Well if you want to watch a movie with your friends, you're going to go buy the damn DVD.

215
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,400
That's what the movie studio is thinking, probably.

216
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,800
Yeah, it's a little weird, but there were some people that really liked that feature

217
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,120
that it got taken away.

218
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,900
I didn't realize how many people were using it until I saw the QQing on my Twitter.

219
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:44,360
So they made indie games harder to find, also.

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,800
I just, you know, download whatever I'm going to watch, and then watch it with a couple

221
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
of friends on AIM.

222
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,120
But I mean, I guess it was the same thing.

223
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,480
Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I really want to watch games, I mean, technically, technically, couldn't

224
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,880
I, and I don't know if this is possible, maybe the chat can help me out here, couldn't I

225
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,000
open up the Xbox party and open up one of those cross-game chat dealies, and then go

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,120
onto Netflix and say, okay, on the count of three, press the start button, one, two, three,

227
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
start.

228
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,640
Or, because it wouldn't really work, because people's bandwidth might be different, or...

229
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,880
I don't know, it might...

230
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
I would think you could still kind of do it.

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
You could wait five seconds before commenting or something, I don't know.

232
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,960
This is weird.

233
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,600
So, anyway, so the new Xbox experience gets up from me.

234
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,360
Other stuff going on in the gaming world this week before we get into specifically what

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
games we've been playing this week.

236
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,920
Of course, Dark Soccer and I already made reference to this earlier in the show.

237
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,740
We went to UMLoud on Thursday, which we've been trying to tell you guys on the show for

238
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,920
weeks and weeks now, like, check it out, go if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, or

239
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,600
check it out online at umloud.org, and thank you, Oil Army, you were noticed in the chat

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,840
room during the pre-show.

241
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,200
I was not able to see chat myself from where I was, but I had the word passed along that

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,360
people were saying hello and stuff, so I really appreciate you guys showing up in force.

243
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,600
I hope some of you guys were able to donate to what is a great cause.

244
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,360
But who wants backstage gossip from the show?

245
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, me, me, me, me, me, me.

246
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,200
I don't have negative stuff to say, no, I had a great time.

247
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,800
And so I'm sure those of you that watch the video feed, and if you haven't seen the video

248
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,660
feed yet, you can check it out, it is archived at umloud.org, and it takes you to the little

249
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,280
Ustream archived presentation, which was part of Game Spots, I guess, providing the bandwidth

250
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,560
or what have you for that whole thing.

251
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,260
You know, there were some audio problems in the beginning, which, you know, just my luck,

252
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,400
my first live shot's gonna go wrong, or something like that.

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,160
So it was very nerve-wracking, but at the end I was feeling a lot better with the interviews

254
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,000
and so forth, and people were very complimentary, so I was very happy, and got a lot of people

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
to come out and donate, which is the most important thing of all, of course, the donation.

256
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,920
But I just wanted to say, you know, despite all the technical things that happened, you

257
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
guys wouldn't believe how much change is on the fly when we're doing live stuff, especially

258
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
video from a big event.

259
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,720
I mean, OLR is one thing, this live environment, this hasn't bothered me for a long time, I

260
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,900
mean, this is kind of like my element, but doing video was a very, very interesting experience.

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,240
But having the very professional people from the AV Society that were helping to put it

262
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,560
on was such a relief, because, like, truly, and I'm not just saying this to kiss ass because

263
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,040
I truly, truly feel this way, like, everybody was super professional and just super awesome.

264
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
And were people stressed out?

265
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Sure.

266
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
I mean, there was a lot to get stressed out about.

267
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Some guests weren't there, and some video clips weren't around, you know, it stings.

268
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
We get stressed out at OLR when the internet goes down and we can't do our show like we

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
planned.

270
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,560
You know, things happen, but it's kind of the way that people kind of react to those

271
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
change and still interact with each other.

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
I just really felt there was still like a really high level of professionalism.

273
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
So I just got to give kudos to all those people that put it on.

274
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
I mean, was it scary?

275
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Yes.

276
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
But was it rewarding?

277
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Absolutely.

278
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Absolutely.

279
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,440
So I had a fantastic time.

280
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
And you were cute.

281
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Your hat was cute.

282
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Thank you.

283
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Thank you.

284
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Thank you.

285
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Thank you.

286
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I have a little thread.

287
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Yes.

288
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,680
A coworker went shopping with me the other night.

289
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,440
We bought an all new outfit, so I'm like, oh, I like that shirt, but I understand Alan

290
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
stealing it from you.

291
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Yes.

292
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Yes.

293
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,520
That's what happens is that, you know, I buy a shirt and then, you know, Alan says, no,

294
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I want that shirt.

295
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Steal.

296
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,720
No, I'm wearing the shirt that I bought for that night, but I really just bought it to

297
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,180
wear under that, uh, my hoodie, uh, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

298
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,520
Kaijuto says no cat fights backstage.

299
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
No, no.

300
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
It's all in the name of charity.

301
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Actually.

302
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I gotta say this.

303
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
This is the cool thing is that, you know, and I was mentioning this a little bit.

304
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,320
On the call on Bobby show is that, you know, one of the other co-hosts was really well

305
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,200
known on Twitch TV and it was streamed on Ustream and you had people behind the scenes

306
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,520
from GameSpot and IGN, but you know what, at the end of the day, who cares?

307
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Who cares?

308
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
It's for charity.

309
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,900
Like, you know, day jobs and all those allegiances and so forth are one thing and the communities

310
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,840
we're into, but at the end of the day, it isn't about us and about our ego.

311
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,800
Everybody really did truly check those in at the door because it was about the charity.

312
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,080
And I honestly, the people I was working with anyway, I don't think have ego anyway.

313
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,880
So you know, I didn't sense that at all.

314
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
I ran into one thing that I'm really not going to discuss, but I think I did a very fluid

315
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
sidestep of drama.

316
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,640
Well you know why I say fluid?

317
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,240
Because I drank.

318
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,040
Anytime you get a group of nerds together, it's always bound to be a hilarious time.

319
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,480
Anyhow, going to our other chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw says everyone loved your beard Rob.

320
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,080
You know, Tiger Claw, I seem to remember you specifically thought the beard was weird at

321
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
first.

322
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,440
So I'm glad you've come full circle and come to embrace the beard that I started a couple

323
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
months ago.

324
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,720
I appreciate it.

325
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Let's see, going back to our chat room, Act Def says, I did watch UMLoud live.

326
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,360
I did see the last part of the pre-show.

327
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Well, thank you.

328
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
It was good times.

329
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
It was really good times.

330
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,100
And they actually, it wasn't just the pre-show they broadcast live, but they broadcast the

331
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,540
whole thing, all the bands.

332
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,380
And I got to say, just hilarious, imaginative bands.

333
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,760
And if you missed us talking about what UMLoud is on last week's show, in a nutshell, people

334
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,560
pay money to play rock band on an actual concert stage.

335
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,360
And so of course they go all out and all the money goes to the Child's Play charity.

336
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,520
I liked the Aperture band.

337
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,960
Oh yeah, the one that was all dressed up like Devo, the Devoid or whatever, that was phenomenal.

338
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,160
And even that very first band that came out after the introduction, they were all dressed

339
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
up like Harry Potter characters and they did You Oughta Know for whatever reason.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But I was like, they're Gryffindor kids singing You Oughta Know.

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's funny.

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That was pretty funny.

343
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But it was, it's great.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,940
Everybody went all out and you know what, I'll tell you this, here's something you didn't

345
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,360
hear on the pre-show literally because the mic was dead.

346
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,760
The first guy I'm interviewing, you don't unfortunately hear that interview at all because

347
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,320
the mic wasn't working and it had to do with the wireless.

348
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
You'll notice it switches from a wireless to a wired because for whatever reason the

349
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
wireless connection just died.

350
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,960
But the first guy I'm interviewing, he actually talked about his band.

351
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,960
He was in the band Gay Riot was the name of the band and they were doing a David Bowie

352
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
song.

353
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,040
But it was really funny when we were talking about it because I said, well, he said the

354
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,520
lead singer was going to dress up like David Bowie.

355
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,120
And I said, I said, well, you know, where's he getting the idea or whatever?

356
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Where'd you guys get this idea?

357
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,200
And he said, oh, well, his girlfriend put him up to it.

358
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,040
I said, so you guys are called Gay Riot, but David Bowie's girlfriend put him up to it.

359
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
He's like, yep.

360
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I said, well, with David Bowie, you never can tell these things.

361
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,320
So there's something you missed out on by there not being audio.

362
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,900
That was, that was a fun interview.

363
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,620
I feel sorry for that guy.

364
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
They were all good sports.

365
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,240
These people completely pulled, like for real, like I will admit, like the raffle fairy,

366
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
Amanda, she's a good friend of mine.

367
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,380
So I, of course I wanted to bring her on, but a lot of those people were complete strangers

368
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,460
and really good sports and some great interviews.

369
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,200
I had a fun time.

370
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,880
I had a good time too, because I got, I was helping to test out the free play setup, which

371
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,840
I set up half of it before my hand said no.

372
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,000
And um, you were singing a lot of songs in there before they opened the doors.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,040
I heard, yeah, well, I always have to, I can't use earplugs because they always make my ears

374
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,680
hurt more for some reason, but I have this fear of being out of key, which people who

375
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,120
know me know why I have that problem.

376
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,880
So I was trying to make sure everything was set up and finally there was this one dude

377
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,040
in there who was a super cool and we played a band on the run and that made me happy because

378
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,520
anyone who appreciates Paul McCartney in the wings is cool in my book.

379
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
All right.

380
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,160
Go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com.

381
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,540
Tiger Claw says, Rob, it would have been great if you got on stage and sang some of the songs.

382
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,420
You know, I, I would have done it, but I wasn't sure if I could because of the other stuff

383
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,040
I was doing, but I think in retrospect, I probably still would have just been able to

384
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,100
buy a band spot and been on at the end.

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,080
So maybe next year, like I'm not opposed to it.

386
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
It's for a good cause.

387
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
It's a great thing.

388
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
We bought raffle tickets.

389
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,400
I, we, Alan and I won a raffle prize.

390
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,920
I haven't got to play it yet because, um, we had, we had to leave before it was over

391
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,700
because keep in mind, San Francisco is a two hour drive and I had to work the next day

392
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,580
with a morning meeting.

393
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,240
So we won the raffle prize late, but we won some fishing game on the way from the raffle,

394
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,840
but we bought a handful of raffle tickets and walked out of there with that.

395
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,440
So anyway, I, I won't talk about it all night, but it was a incredible time.

396
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,540
Met a lot of great people, um, can't wait for next year and, um, go watch the live feed

397
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,400
and if you like it, fricking donate.

398
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
It's a great cause.

399
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,940
I mean, remember there's a lot of kids in hospitals that would just love to have just

400
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,100
any some of these expensive systems we talk about, like three DS and some of this stuff,

401
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,680
you know, even if they're too young to enjoy this stuff, child's play goes so far to get

402
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,360
like coloring books and things like that.

403
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,620
You know, remember this is just a really tough time of year.

404
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,720
You know, a lot of kids, you know, sometimes don't easily have access to that stuff when

405
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,160
they're going through a really hard time.

406
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,760
So child's play kind of helps deliver that.

407
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,960
So just think about that.

408
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
No stuffed animals.

409
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,520
It's actually the only thing, um, if you're going to donate a toy, do not donate a stuffed

410
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,640
animal because they do carry germs.

411
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Interesting.

412
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
It has to be something that can be sterilized.

413
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,040
I didn't think about that.

414
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I just donate money.

415
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah.

416
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Money.

417
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Money's good.

418
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
So, all right.

419
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Anyhow, uh, umlab.org.

420
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,880
So how about our gaming weeks?

421
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,480
Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week and enjoying, um, in

422
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
our time that we're not trying to raise money for charity.

423
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Dark Sakura?

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
What?

426
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
How was your gaming week?

427
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
That's the question.

428
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I know.

429
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
That was my answer.

430
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Um, what?

431
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
You played rock band.

432
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
I played rock band.

433
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I played some well.

434
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,820
I was going to play dance masters yesterday, um, but I was feeling really crappy.

435
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Really crap.

436
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
I was bugging you to do that too.

437
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
You were.

438
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
I was gonna.

439
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,880
I was gonna do everything and then I was like, I got out of my seat and everything.

440
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,080
No, I was going to go in and set it up and then I was just not feeling well.

441
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
We had a busy beginning of the week cause I know you had a lot of rush design projects

442
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,700
and I had a lot of design to do.

443
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,800
I had, um, I had umlaude.

444
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,960
I had the American river review release party, which by the way, the 2012 American river

445
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
review is out.

446
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,840
If you go to arc.losrios.edu and go to the bookstore link, you can order a copy.

447
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,200
So if our international audience wants to see what the local community college here

448
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
tell.

449
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm going to, I'm going to tell why people internationally will like it because it actually

450
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,080
wins national awards, beats out the big four year schools and has some amazing literature

451
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,280
and artwork in it this year and culinary recipes, which I laid out.

452
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,960
Look at you showing your college pride.

453
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I love it.

454
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm pretty proud of it.

455
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
You should be.

456
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,640
Well, ARC is like the biggest, um, junior college in California.

457
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Is there any video gaming content in the magazine?

458
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,860
Not quite, but there's plenty of pop culture.

459
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Maybe you should.

460
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,960
That should be something you should think about for next year.

461
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Just saying.

462
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,440
Well, I'm hoping next year we actually get some of the 3d modelers putting their stuff

463
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
in.

464
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Okay.

465
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Well that's cool.

466
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,320
Because like, well when I took the 3d class, I did a turret from portal.

467
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I remember that.

468
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,120
That was a really cute little thing you did.

469
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,320
And other people have done, you know, different.

470
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,200
One person did a Game Boy Advance, you know, so I'm saying you get, there's, um, there's

471
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
definitely references.

472
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,840
I mean, a lot of the stories in there, there's definitely a few, uh, geeks doing the writing.

473
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,720
So but I think that it's worthwhile.

474
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,960
So really that's what my, um, that and UmLoud have really been what's taken up the bulk

475
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
of my week.

476
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,400
Not really specifically gaming, but it's been two worthy things that I was proud to have

477
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
been involved in this week.

478
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
All right.

479
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
That's good to me.

480
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Fair compromise.

481
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Loki, how about you?

482
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,280
You sadly couldn't make it to UmLoud because you know you have other obligations, but what

483
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
did you do this week?

484
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,860
Uh, I played Skyrim, mostly.

485
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,640
And I swear I waste so much time doing meaningless tasks like item management and what I can

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
carry with me.

487
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,680
And I have, I was literally today spending time at the, uh, enchantment table or whatever

488
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:13,520
to give my armor some extra, um, lifting abilities so I can just carry more crap with me as I'm

489
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
going around.

490
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,760
Um, I did one of the quests, which was, uh, I think it was called a night to remember

491
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,920
or something like that.

492
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,120
And where you get drunk and somehow end up like on the completely other side of the world.

493
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,520
And that's kind of what happened.

494
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,400
And so I've been journeying my way back, but thankfully I could fast travel back to Whiterun

495
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,480
to dump my crap into a cabinet, which this cabinet must have an infinite amount of space

496
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
because I...

497
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
It's a big cabinet.

498
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
It's a very big cabinet.

499
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,840
What you don't see in Skyrim is that at the other end of the cabinet is the door to Narnia.

500
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,960
So you just have all of Narnia to store your shit.

501
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
It pretty much is like that.

502
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Um, and it was, it was...

503
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Black Wolf in our chat room says, Loki was lollygagging.

504
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,600
And it's funny though, cause like I had to dump off, like I had 150 carrots, 150 carrots

505
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
for no reason whatsoever.

506
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,180
You wascally wabbit.

507
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,200
So the first thing I started doing is like, I'm going to eat all these carrots right now.

508
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,080
So I was like hammering down A, but it just took forever to do that.

509
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Your skill in vitamin A has increased to 22.

510
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,200
So I decided I'm going to make it rain.

511
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,160
So I ran upstairs into this, like, uh, in this general goods store, ran upstairs to

512
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,000
the balcony and I was going to throw the carrots off the balcony and want to see like a pile

513
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of carrots.

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And you get a carrot!

515
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And you get a carrot!

516
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,080
And you get a carrot!

517
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,200
But no, unfortunately it doesn't do it like that.

518
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,000
You would have to drop each one individually, um, because otherwise it drops them in piles

519
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,320
of like 109 and stuff.

520
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,480
It was very unepic.

521
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,120
So um, so yeah, I didn't do that.

522
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,760
But um, I don't know, I've just been playing a lot.

523
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,680
I think I actually looked at my playtime, I have like 36 hours in the game, and I've

524
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,920
done like nothing.

525
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,520
And I've probably further progressed in the story than you.

526
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,960
I've done like hardly anything in there.

527
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,160
I like to go, I like to find the random dungeons, but then I'm like, oh I don't want to explore

528
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,480
this dungeon because somebody in the nearby town might have a quest.

529
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,280
So I need to go to the quest and talk to everybody until I find the, and then I'm picking every

530
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,360
single fucking flower on the way because I can't stop!

531
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Yeah.

532
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,640
And the game is horrible for people who have, like, because I go in with the JRPG mindset

533
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
from Final Fantasy, right?

534
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,640
Gotta find every treasure box, gotta open everything, gotta get every item, I want my

535
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,160
perfect run through, 999 everything, right?

536
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,840
Like you take that mindset to Skyrim, you are fucked.

537
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,000
You'll never get anything done, and you will have 150 carrots in your goddamn bag because

538
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,680
you picked every single one.

539
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,880
Like that's...

540
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,120
I go through all the towns searching the barrels, and I know very well that there's not gold

541
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
in those barrels.

542
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,200
Like carrots, or apples, or tomatoes, or maybe cabbage that's worth nothing.

543
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,280
Carrots are literally worth nothing, you cannot sell them for any money whatsoever.

544
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,860
But you can eat them!

545
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,260
You can eat them, or drop them on the ground.

546
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,560
You know that if you eat too many carrots it will turn you orange?

547
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,280
I shit you not, that happened to me when I was two, and I had to go to the ER.

548
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,500
It's actually happened to several famous people, like one of them was, what was her name that

549
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,720
played the older sister on the Partridge family?

550
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
I don't know.

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
Susan Day, wasn't that her?

552
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Okay, sure.

553
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,200
But she ate nothing but carrots, like, and they had to tell her to stop eating carrots

554
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
because she turned orange on screen.

555
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
Come on, get orange!

556
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Trivia!

557
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
But, um...

558
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,240
If I'm ever on Useless Crap Jeopardy, I'll remember that.

559
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm trying to think if there's any other funny stuff that's happened, like, glitch-wise and

560
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
stuff.

561
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Because I know there has been.

562
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,520
Uh, yeah, like, exploring random things, I went into a cottage, and there was this really

563
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,720
powerful wizard in the cottage that wanted to kill me.

564
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,520
I was like, oooookay.

565
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:00,040
Um, or the, what is it, there's like some sort of, there's like so many bands of, like,

566
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,920
I've lost track of all the different groups in the games, like, you know, they have the

567
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:12,480
Imperials and the Stormcloaks, and then they have the, the, what was it, the Followers,

568
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,960
or like, this is, and then some other weird band that's somewhere else that has these

569
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,520
weird, like, bone weapons that, they apparently suck, though, because I kicked the crap out

570
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,240
of them, but, um, yeah, so I played, basically I played lots of Skyrim, didn't really do

571
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,120
much, um, in the game, other than, you know, going around.

572
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,360
I did happen, though, I was walking along, and I saw these people wandering, there were

573
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,520
traders that were bringing gifts for a wedding that was the cousin of, like, some head of

574
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,960
the trade council or something like that.

575
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,000
And so they're like, and they're basically like, oh, um, you know, we really should get

576
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,080
on our way, and then one of the options was, I'm gonna take those gifts from you.

577
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
So that's one of the options I did.

578
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,480
And then I murdered them and stole their gifts.

579
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,760
And I'm not, I think that's part of a quest, but I'm not really sure.

580
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay, last Skyrim thing, and then we've got to move on, okay?

581
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,560
Well, someone actually did have a question.

582
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
What?

583
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
In the chat?

584
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,040
Yeah, did you offer the wizard carrots, Loki?

585
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Except I think it's a statement because he didn't use any, um, punctuation.

586
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Okay.

587
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
No, I did not.

588
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
All right.

589
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
I got to play this.

590
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Bobby sent this to me.

591
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
He said, don't play the sound.

592
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
So I guess there's talking or whatever over it.

593
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
But he says music.

594
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
It's funny.

595
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Is it?

596
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Oh, you've heard this?

597
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Yes.

598
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
He says it's 2,500 cheese wheels rolling off a mountain.

599
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Let's see here.

600
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
It's awesome.

601
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
It's done with console commands.

602
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Okay.

603
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Oh, there they all go.

604
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
That is a mountain of cheese.

605
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
There's your whole.

606
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,040
See, that's the kind of epic.

607
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,220
What about this 4,200 cabbages going downhill in the related video?

608
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,040
This is really fast forward over there.

609
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Oh, there they go.

610
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,860
All the cabbages going downhill.

611
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
That's not Skyrim music.

612
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
What the hell is that?

613
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
It's like.

614
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I don't know.

615
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
It's like techno porn music.

616
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
It's like porno music.

617
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,860
That's tech demo music, Rob.

618
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,860
If you like cabbages, that's like tech demo music, seriously, you like Skyrim.

619
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,620
I got the video for you.

620
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
Welcome to Skyrim Rob Live.

621
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,620
I mentioned last week or maybe the week before last that once you do a few quests for people

622
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,540
that all of a sudden they started trusting you with their possessions, which means that's

623
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,260
the prime time to go clear out all the possessions out of their houses, including all the goblets

624
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
and stuff.

625
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,700
That's not even worth money, but because I'm a klepto, I have to take everything.

626
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,860
I found out that after a while they restock all their stuff in their house.

627
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,700
So I went to the castle again and took everything out of the castle again and then threw them

628
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
off the mountain.

629
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
All right.

630
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
Can we move on?

631
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
I want to talk about something other than Skyrim.

632
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,420
Skyrim's been out almost a month now.

633
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,580
Oh, and play lots of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare.

634
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
It's awesome.

635
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
All right.

636
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Actually, Skyrim's been out one month today.

637
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Today's December 11th.

638
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Anyway.

639
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
All right.

640
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Other games.

641
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,580
My gaming week.

642
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Yay.

643
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm going to talk about three games.

644
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Three new things I played this week.

645
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Okay.

646
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:12,060
On the Xbox 360, I checked out Apples to Apples, which is the translation of the ever popular

647
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,560
card party game.

648
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I don't even...

649
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,940
I can't fathom how that works.

650
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,860
Well, it's not like...

651
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,700
It's pretty much what you'd think.

652
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,000
If you're playing an Xbox Live, there's single player and then there's Xbox Live.

653
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,580
So Xbox Live is the obvious mode, right?

654
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,160
You go in and it goes around.

655
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
It's just like the game.

656
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,140
And if you've never played the game before, you have green cards which have words like...

657
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,420
They're like adjectives, like depressing or things like that might be one of the green

658
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
cards.

659
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:47,180
And then the red cards all have nouns or time periods, celebrities, person place things

660
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,220
type of stuff.

661
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,760
And you have to play the card that you think the judge for that round who drew the green

662
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,260
card will pick.

663
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,260
And for example, one of the red cards is Helen Keller.

664
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,740
And that will always win every round.

665
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,540
And I'm proud to say Helen Keller is in the Apples to Apples 360 game.

666
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,620
It had to be there.

667
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,780
So if somebody plays the green card sassy and I play Helen Keller, then somebody might

668
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,940
pick that as the winner.

669
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,520
And then the winner gets a point and then whoever gets 5, 10 points, whatever the game's

670
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
rules are first, wins the game.

671
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,300
So that's cool and all, but it's Xbox Live and you never really know the people on Xbox

672
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Live.

673
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,680
And what I notice is that political jokes on cards are really hard to make on Xbox Live

674
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,560
because you might get a card.

675
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,060
What was the one I got today?

676
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:40,020
It was something like oppressive and somebody played Ronald Reagan and like, I thought it

677
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
was funny.

678
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
I'm like, I get it.

679
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,020
I it's a joke, but somebody else is like, whatever, you know, and like it started this

680
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,260
whole political discussion.

681
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,420
I'm just like, come on, it's Apples to Apples people.

682
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
This isn't fun.

683
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,380
What about the single player?

684
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,700
How the hell does that work?

685
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,340
It's the single player is Boggle.

686
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,660
You ever play Boggle?

687
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,520
So you know that where you find the words in the mixed grid of letters.

688
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,820
And so in the first few levels, you're just trying to figure out what red card would the

689
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,700
computer pick.

690
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,020
And it's really obvious.

691
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,080
Like it's all these big stereotypes, like Helen Keller, no, the Apple might be dressed

692
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,840
up like a princess.

693
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,260
And so the card might be something like, you know, pretty and the cards you get are like

694
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,300
nuclear war, uh, you know, oatmeal and diamonds.

695
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,920
And so a princess of course is going to pick diamonds.

696
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,540
So you have to find in the board D I A O M and he spell out diamonds.

697
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,580
It's kind of dumb.

698
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,740
That sounds like racial profiling to me a little bit.

699
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,580
It's stereotyping a lot, but especially when you start getting into like the Cowboys and

700
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,800
the hippies and all that stuff.

701
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,420
But anyway, it gets impossibly hard though when words just disappear from the red cards

702
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:54,340
and now it'll be like, it'll like the red card will be rock and question, question,

703
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,420
question, question.

704
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,060
And so you have to look on the board and be able to find role and know that it goes with

705
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
rock.

706
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,160
And not only that, you have to figure out which one of the three cards it's, it's as

707
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,520
impossible to figure out how to play as it is to figure out how I'm explaining it to

708
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
you to be honest.

709
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,580
So single player gets weird fast.

710
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,560
So I honestly think apples to apples is only going to be fun if you have people to play

711
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
it with.

712
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
And how much was it again?

713
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
10 bucks.

714
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,240
And honestly, for that price, you should go to target and actually buy apples to apples.

715
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,960
I mean, really, you'll have more fun with real people than you will, I think online.

716
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Sorry to say, but, um, you know, for, I guess a card game going to a flash game from a technical

717
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,720
perspective would be, it integrates with Facebook.

718
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,920
If you want to spam your achievements for everybody, I don't see every Xbox game doing

719
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
that.

720
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
So I guess some people are into that.

721
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
All right.

722
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,660
Uh, since you brought up games that are party games that have been translated to the Xbox,

723
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,200
here's a challenge for any developers out there that I think this would be perfect.

724
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,240
For an indie game, because the sure as hell aren't going to bring the Xbox live arcade

725
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
eat poop.

726
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You cat.

727
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Oh yeah.

728
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Yeah.

729
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,000
You've talked about this on the show before, but for those, for those who don't know what

730
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,640
game you're talking about, it's basically like a visual telephone.

731
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,920
You start off by writing a phrase, you know, it could be like, I like apples.

732
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,840
And then the next person draws what draws a picture of the phrase.

733
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,080
And then, uh, the person after that, the first phrase is hidden.

734
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,280
So all they see is the picture and they have to come up with a new caption for it.

735
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,000
And it goes on from there until, especially when you get people that can't draw at all

736
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
like me.

737
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,840
Yeah, it goes on from there.

738
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,040
But I think that'd be hilarious to do like a, you know, a game like that.

739
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,320
Maybe have Xbox live support or something like that.

740
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,440
Alpha Kana gram in our chat room is going so far as to correct me and even saying, but

741
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,740
sky it's $20 is target at target.

742
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
It's double.

743
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,840
Well, well hold on.

744
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,360
Alpha Kana gram, I'm going to one up you because if you want to play with your friend on Xbox,

745
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,400
you both have to buy the game.

746
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,800
So that's $10 each ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

747
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,780
And more if you have more friends, right?

748
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,160
So anyhow, I love that somebody actually went to look that up.

749
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm going to hope he just bought that as a Christmas present for somebody recently or

750
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,840
whatever it is he celebrates this time of year.

751
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
All right.

752
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,080
Um, anyhow, uh, so there was that other games I played this week, Mario Kart seven on the

753
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,360
three D S um, I'm going to say the exact same thing every other reviewer has said about

754
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Mario Kart seven.

755
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,480
You ready?

756
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
It's Mario Kart.

757
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,760
That's really an accurate description.

758
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,840
I mean, you, you know, Mario Kart, anybody who's been playing games for a while knows

759
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Mario Kart.

760
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,840
It's the same game that was on the DS and the it's on every Nintendo system and it's

761
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,980
on now on the three D S the three D is tasteful.

762
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,160
It's not over the top.

763
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,000
Uh, it's, it's done fine.

764
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,560
It's, it's fun to play with three D.

765
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,680
The online works just like the Wii.

766
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,700
This almost essentially feels like a port of the Wii game to the three D S but with

767
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,240
some newer tracks.

768
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,120
I don't understand some of the online stuff they integrated.

769
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,260
Like my three D S will randomly get these randoms, um, ghosts just seem to download

770
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
from online.

771
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Randomly random ghosts.

772
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Yes.

773
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Randomly random.

774
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
It's super random.

775
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,400
It's more, it's redundantly redundant.

776
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,620
And it'll be like, you just got a new ghost and I'll be like, Oh, maybe I street passed

777
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,320
with somebody or maybe somebody on my friends list just, you know, somehow sent me a ghost

778
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
from through the internet.

779
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
How cool.

780
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,000
And then I'll, I'll race against the ghost and it'll be like, you beat Kanji cut text

781
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
from Japan.

782
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
And I'm like, I don't know this person.

783
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,180
Why did it send me this ghost?

784
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,640
So you get like random stuff, but you can do community stuff in Mario Kart.

785
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm going to name my first born Kanji text from Japan.

786
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Shut up.

787
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,480
Um, uh, you can do community stuff.

788
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,000
So of course, as we do for any new community thing that hits the internet, we have run

789
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,360
and hurriedly set up the OL army community.

790
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,440
I have no idea how community racing works for, from what I understand, there's like

791
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,140
a top three for the month and you can do all that.

792
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,160
So the friend code is posted on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or sorry, community code.

793
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,280
It's different than a friend code.

794
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,000
The community code for the oil army is posted on Twitter and it's on our Facebooks as well.

795
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,480
Um, and I'm sure somebody will post it in chat in a matter of minutes at us because

796
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,800
live during the break tonight, I'm going to try and play it.

797
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,560
Now I understand it might be an entire grand prix race, so I might have to drop, but I'll

798
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,360
do at least a couple of races with you guys during the mid point break tonight.

799
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,240
I am planning on getting this game and actually I'm also planning, not even planning.

800
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,680
I am getting super Mario three land.

801
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,040
I will have it Friday.

802
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,400
Uh, tiger call on our chat says it's spot pass.

803
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah, I know it's spot pass, but it makes no sense.

804
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Like I get spot passes.

805
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,560
Some of the other games I play like, uh, super Mario three, I know what it is.

806
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,280
It's all those Japanese developers that you, uh, street passed within.

807
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,200
Didn't you like do some at E3?

808
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,880
Do you think because I've exchanged data with them before, like at E3, now I'm getting all

809
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
their ghosts.

810
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Really?

811
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah.

812
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
So I'm playing against Japanese developers and I'm kicking their ass.

813
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Yeah.

814
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Yeah, I think so.

815
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,880
I think if you cross reference those ghosts with, you know, really, yeah, cause that would

816
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,880
be a, that makes a lot of sense actually.

817
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
That's kind of weird.

818
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,880
Interesting.

819
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,160
I know somebody who got me a moto's me at E3.

820
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
No, no, no, no.

821
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Hold on.

822
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm sorry.

823
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,080
It's just the door is wide open for the jokes.

824
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,680
You might be easy to be because they are of a certain nationality and they're not, they're,

825
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:36,600
they're not typically good drivers.

826
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Racism fail.

827
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
All right.

828
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,080
That's racism racing right there.

829
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,400
Stop.

830
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,760
All right.

831
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
But I will say this.

832
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,320
The other thing I got to say about Mario Kart seven is that a lot of really good retro tracks

833
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
came back.

834
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,600
Like a Waluigi pinball.

835
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
That track is so fun.

836
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,320
And some of the Wii tracks came back that are awesome too.

837
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Here's my gripe.

838
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,160
And this has been since like, I think even the NDS one.

839
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,720
What's up with them bringing back the most terrible tracks for battle mode.

840
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,120
Like their, their decision, Hey, from the test before let's bring back the big donut

841
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
or something like that.

842
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,340
Like one of the, like the most, you know, kind of terrible.

843
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,160
Like they brought back Mario circuit two from the original super Nintendo game.

844
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,800
And like if I was going to bring back one of the courses in the super Nintendo game,

845
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,200
I would have brought back one of the ghost houses because those levels were epic.

846
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,160
I think they did that in the DS one though.

847
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
I know.

848
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,640
I mean, they pick, they pick these really random tracks that they bring back.

849
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,960
It's like, and you didn't want to bring back block four or you didn't want to bring back,

850
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,880
you know, um, I don't remember the one that they had that where's another one.

851
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,640
It was like a four tiered one that was on or three tiered one on the Nintendo 64 version.

852
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,720
That was pretty awesome, but Oh, those, you know, those are terrible.

853
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,320
We'll just bring back the donut or all the weird ones that they had in the Wii there

854
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,160
just made no sense.

855
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,800
All right.

856
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,160
Um, so that's Mario Kart seven.

857
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,960
It's Mario Kart, but it's like, look, if you have a three DS already, you probably have

858
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,560
already bought Mario Kart seven.

859
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,280
I don't know what else I can tell you.

860
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,920
If you've never played a Mario Kart game before, then go to a friend's house who has it and

861
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
use download play.

862
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,600
Cause you can do download play with one cart and there you go.

863
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Instant demo.

864
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
All right.

865
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
One more.

866
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You should have brought your system.

867
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
All right.

868
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
One more game.

869
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I street pass with people at Umlaut too.

870
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:32,800
They have new houses in Mario three D land, toad houses and stuff, so anyway, one more

871
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,400
game to talk about this week, one more Unimas.

872
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,640
And it's a game that Loki loaned to me two weeks ago that I finally got around to playing

873
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
this week.

874
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Yes.

875
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,440
I jumped in and I played saints row, the third, which is totally not the type of game I would

876
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,640
ever imagine myself playing because like, I get why people like grand theft auto, but

877
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm always like, eh, you know what I'd rather play a role playing game or something, but

878
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,560
I decided to approach saints row three with an open mind and I got our saints row, the

879
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
third season with an open mind.

880
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,880
And I got to tell you, well, I should say this.

881
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,840
I played the first game in the series or I played like a extended demo or some, I played

882
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
it at friend's house or something else.

883
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,960
Kind of like, Oh, okay.

884
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
It's grand theft auto.

885
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Huh?

886
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,240
So when this new one comes out, I'm like, Oh, and look, he's telling me, no, really.

887
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
It's it's like way over the top and it's crazy.

888
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Now it's so fun.

889
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Like it's not like the first game.

890
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
It's kind of like, Oh sure.

891
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Lucky.

892
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Sure.

893
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
You just, you just like this game.

894
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
That's cool.

895
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
That's cool.

896
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,560
And I have not laughed, I have not laughed this hard at a video game in a very long time.

897
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,620
It is so funny.

898
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,600
And it's funny because it's stupid as hell.

899
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,840
But in that getting together to watch a movie with your friends, that's really bad.

900
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,640
Like a Manos, the hands of fate, mystery science theater kind of way.

901
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,560
Like it was awful, great.

902
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,940
And I got to say just, I am actually really impressed at how well they integrate the whole

903
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,320
create your own character and get it into the experience.

904
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,220
Because like, you know, towards the beginning of the game, you're allowed to create whatever

905
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,640
kind of character you want.

906
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,860
You can create a boy, girl, big boobies, little boobies, you know, fat, skinny.

907
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,480
Although I would argue that their version of fat is not that fat, but whatever.

908
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,100
And you know, you can do whatever you can have your character run around naked for all

909
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
you care.

910
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,960
You know, you could, you can design your character.

911
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,840
It's a great creator.

912
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
And then you get to pick a voice.

913
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Do you want a man voice?

914
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Do you want a woman voice?

915
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,560
Or do you want to be a zombie?

916
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,860
And no matter what it is you pick, you're like fully integrated into the game as the

917
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,040
leader of this gang.

918
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,960
So I decided to make my character, I made kind of like, like a Pam Greer from a Blackspoitation

919
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,600
film in the 70s, if she had gigantic, well, she did have gigantic titties, but like unrealistically

920
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,540
big titties, because I took the tip meter as high as it would go.

921
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,040
And she's large and in charge.

922
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,960
And at first I was going to make her a grandma, but I decided, no, I'm going to scale back

923
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,080
the age a little bit.

924
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,240
So she's kind of like, she's like a husky kind of Pam Greer.

925
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,680
And it's like, what I love about it is that it flows so well with the, with the woman

926
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,200
voice and everything, like, like the way, I know what you guys are thinking, like, what

927
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
are you saying?

928
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
A woman can't be in charge or whatever.

929
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,580
But no, what I'm saying is that it's almost like they've recorded everything seven or

930
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:23,040
eight times or however many characters there are to get the script to work impressive,

931
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,280
that attention to detail on something so stupid, but it pays off tremendously.

932
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,680
That attention to detail pays off tremendously.

933
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,960
I was laughing so fucking hard.

934
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,600
I was crying during that airplane sequence where my character gets sucked out the door.

935
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,760
So her fat ass is rolling down the little shoot and then they're skydiving or whatever.

936
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,520
And there's this whole like skydiving sequence and you're, you're literally flipping upside

937
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,340
down to shoot people mid-air as you're skydiving.

938
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,960
And then you're flipping right side up.

939
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,200
And then like, you're going, are we about to fly through that plane window?

940
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,400
And you know, there's only one way we can do this.

941
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,080
And so you, you throw the chick off your back and she yells ASSHOLE as you throw her.

942
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,980
And just my character stays sassy the entire time, which is so true to the character I

943
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,740
wanted her to be.

944
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,760
Or you got to remember, to put this in perspective, last week or the week before I was talking

945
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,000
about White Knight Chronicles 2 on the PlayStation 3, where you also create a character, but

946
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,620
your character never talks.

947
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,380
Your character is a bystander.

948
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,080
Your character isn't integrated into the story at all.

949
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,280
I'm not saying this makes White Knight Chronicles a bad game, but when you put that side by

950
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,080
side with the lengths that they've gone to integrate whatever it is you want into Saints

951
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,740
Row the Third, I am like so impressed with that level of detail.

952
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:48,180
And just, just the fact that my character can get into a tank and blow shit up and,

953
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,420
and as Bobby was talking about in his show before when he was talking about the game,

954
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,900
and I noticed this too, I was so damn impressed with that sequence where you get in the car

955
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,260
and you're listening to the radio and Sublime's What I Got comes on the radio and you and

956
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,240
your, your gang member that you're driving with starts singing along to the song like

957
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,940
loving is what I got and they're, they're singing it the way people in that role would

958
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,940
really sing it.

959
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,340
You know, it's like there's a line in the song that goes like, but I can still get high

960
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:23,480
and like my character shouts like, you know, it like it's, it's little things like that

961
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,380
that just put this game in a caliber where it's like, you really like, I think you have

962
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,580
to experience it.

963
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,220
Like I Loki, you're right.

964
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,860
It's game is hilarious and it's fun to play.

965
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,060
But it's, I'm going to have to play it and only gets better.

966
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,740
It's just, it's like you think that the whole airplane thing was ridiculous.

967
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,740
Let me put it this way.

968
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,020
Have you seen the new, the new 18 movie?

969
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,940
You had no, I haven't seen the new 18 movie.

970
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,940
Okay.

971
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,660
Well there's, let me put it this way.

972
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,020
The first skydive sequence reminded me a lot of shoot them up the Clive Owen movie.

973
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:02,940
This their spoiler, there is a second skydive sequence at one point that reminds me a lot

974
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,540
of the a team where they try to fly a tank.

975
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,540
I can't, I can't stress.

976
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,260
And then, no, somebody in the chat room asked, Rama Rama asked if I gave my character an

977
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Afro.

978
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,260
No, I did.

979
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,940
I, I gave, I gave her the long flowing hot black hair to go, you know, she's got the

980
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,380
volume of the Beyonce luminous, no, she has voluminous hair, kind of a modern, modern

981
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,940
day Jackie Brown, Pam Greer looking thing.

982
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,740
But um, just my character is so sassy and that's what I wanted her to be.

983
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,580
And it's great.

984
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,060
I did, I did play some more Saints Row the Third this week.

985
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
I forgot.

986
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,480
I, we've been playing horde mode during our lunch breaks and that game, horde mode is

987
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,900
pretty fun on its own actually.

988
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
It's just really ridiculous.

989
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,460
Some of the stuff that they have.

990
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,100
Now what cracks me up, Dark Sakura, when you play through the game, what you should do

991
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,340
is you should make a zombie because apparently if you play as a zombie, that is still integrated

992
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,660
in the story mode.

993
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:03,220
So like, you know, your characters will be talking, your characters like seriously what

994
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,220
they do.

995
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Yeah.

996
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,220
What you said.

997
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,700
So you really think we should do that?

998
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,860
I don't want to play a zombie.

999
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,820
If I play it, I want to make a, you know, my type of character and the zombie will sing

1000
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,220
what I got as well.

1001
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,820
Travis Donovan over at under station live made me, he's been playing through the game

1002
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,100
as me and apparently I like to run around.

1003
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,740
I apparently I do this in real life with hot pink bunny slippers and a hello kitty backpack

1004
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,240
because that's what the me character in the game has, but I imagine the game is hilarious

1005
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:41,300
still because you're playing this guy and you know, probably still really funny with

1006
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,300
all the outfits.

1007
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,820
So just don't expect like you got to put a game like Saints Row the Third side by side

1008
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:54,860
with Skyrim and they couldn't, they're so different, but they're both like open world

1009
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,020
games and so forth.

1010
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,280
And I think, I think it's just one of those things where it's like, like Skyrim is the

1011
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,900
Oscar nominated picture you see at the art house movie, which is a great experience and

1012
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,700
you'll just, you'll be, you know, happy to have witnessed it.

1013
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:15,220
And then it's basically, it's Laura, the rings and fucking transformers.

1014
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,100
I mean, or no, it's like except transformers wasn't actually saints row.

1015
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:25,340
The third is like getting high and going to see, um, pink Floyd's the wall set to the

1016
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,340
lasers.

1017
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,340
No.

1018
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,740
Would it be the difference between watching Lord of the rings and Friday?

1019
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,740
Yes.

1020
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,740
That's a great analogy.

1021
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,780
Friday is also an amazing movie, right?

1022
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,140
It's hilarious, but not for the same reasons.

1023
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,780
Friday is just fucking funny, right?

1024
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,780
That's a great analogy.

1025
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,260
I would compare it to like Lord of the rings in the movie.

1026
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,860
Shoot them up, shoot them up is seriously like this game follows that movie.

1027
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,860
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that they took straight out of just ridiculous actions sequences.

1028
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,820
Um, like the whole, whole intro is seriously ripped off of that movie, but I don't care

1029
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,820
cause it's awesome.

1030
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,340
All right, let's go to one question from the chat room and then we'll, we got to get to

1031
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,460
gaming news.

1032
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,860
It's been like an hour and we're still talking about our gaming weeks.

1033
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,300
Tiger class says, makes you wonder if they were ever to make a saints row movie, would

1034
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,780
it be an action comedy?

1035
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,220
Okay, look, whoever does the saints row movie, which I am all for at this point, like I think

1036
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,820
I absolutely think they should make a saints row movie and I think it should be over the

1037
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,660
top stupid funny.

1038
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,180
Like it needs to be like airplane.

1039
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
Okay.

1040
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,820
So I think the Zucker brothers should do the saints row movie.

1041
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,100
I need to just incorporate Leslie Nielsen in there somewhere.

1042
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
He's dead.

1043
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,100
I know, but I mean, it doesn't matter.

1044
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,100
It doesn't matter.

1045
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,240
They could, you know, work him in cause it would have to have through technology these

1046
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
days.

1047
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Exactly.

1048
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,380
Well they could, if they could do, you know, what was that last, um, Bruce Lee movie where

1049
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,140
he's, you know, dead halfway through filming it.

1050
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,140
I love it.

1051
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:59,380
See her in our chat room says, I thought you guys were talking about the song Friday.

1052
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,100
Still an accurate comparison.

1053
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,780
Lord of the rings.

1054
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,100
Rebecca blacks Friday was 17 gazillion YouTube views.

1055
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,100
All right, look.

1056
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,580
So that was my gaming week saints row, the third hilariously stupid, hilarious.

1057
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,580
All right.

1058
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,020
And I will play more of it because I just, I laugh consistently when I'm playing that

1059
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,020
game.

1060
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,020
And I think that's so important.

1061
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,540
So, all right.

1062
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,880
Sometimes you want final fantasy.

1063
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,780
Sometimes you want Dick and fart jokes.

1064
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,060
All right.

1065
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,060
Housekeeping twitter.com slash O L R.

1066
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,260
Visit us on Twitter, uh, facebook.com slash orange.

1067
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,260
I'll show you.

1068
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,480
We are on Facebook upcoming show schedule.

1069
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,720
We will be here next week on the 18th.

1070
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,660
We will not be here on the 25th.

1071
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,580
Although some alternative thing might go on on the 25th, like online or something.

1072
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,580
I don't know.

1073
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,780
Um, we got a milkshake.

1074
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,780
Where's mine.

1075
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,780
All right.

1076
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Just kidding.

1077
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,940
I, anyway, uh, I had Starbucks on the way here.

1078
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,580
If you can't tell, I'm wired on coffee today on the first.

1079
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,660
We should have a show as of right now.

1080
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,140
It looks like we will have a show on the first.

1081
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,200
I don't know if anybody who doesn't camp or whatever be here on the first.

1082
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,600
So I think we're doing a show then, which is the exact opposite of Bobby who comes on

1083
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
before us.

1084
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,080
Bobby's going to do a show Christmas night.

1085
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,260
So spend, spend your Christmas with Bobby here on all games radio and then spend your

1086
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,260
new years with us.

1087
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,260
We'll ring in 2012.

1088
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,260
Okay.

1089
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:26,020
Um, let's get into the gaming news, but surprisingly enough for this time of year when everybody's

1090
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,380
getting ready to go on holiday breaks and everything, there's a lot of damn gaming news

1091
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,380
going on.

1092
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,380
Right?

1093
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,380
Loki start us off.

1094
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,380
Yeah.

1095
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,180
We're going to be talking about this, uh, the spike video game award show.

1096
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,220
And of course with the VGA's, there's a lot of, um, do you watch the VGA's?

1097
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,220
Nope.

1098
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,220
No.

1099
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,220
Me neither.

1100
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,220
Nope.

1101
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,220
I just, I don't even have to ask Jamie.

1102
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,220
I'll just watch the trailers afterwards.

1103
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,220
Why am I going to waste?

1104
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,220
Thank you.

1105
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,220
Tiger call.

1106
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,220
It was game of death.

1107
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,740
Everything I've heard about the VGA's online was that they just like people felt their

1108
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,020
IQs dropping rapidly as they were watching it as if anybody should be surprised.

1109
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,020
It's spike.

1110
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,940
No offense, but I mean they have game trailers, TV and game trailers did a lot of the, um,

1111
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,740
you know, while they did all the trailer stuff, they have it hosted on their site, but it's

1112
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,300
just like watching GTTV, you know, because it's really late and obviously I don't watch

1113
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,860
it then, but I'll just catch it, you know, when the trailers come online the next day

1114
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,060
and that's kind of what happened, um, for the most part.

1115
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:26,100
Um, so one of the, of course announced, they tease and they announced a lot of games, um,

1116
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
during the show.

1117
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,580
So one of the games of course that's been in, you know, talked about for a while, Metal

1118
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,580
Gear Solid Rising.

1119
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,220
Well, now apparently Metal Gear Solid Rising is now Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance,

1120
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:45,820
which almost sounds like a made up word, but I'm, it's, subtitles are cool.

1121
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,880
It's vengeance, but revenge.

1122
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,880
It's called a portmanteau.

1123
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,280
Um, it's a combination of two words, duh.

1124
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,540
Really why I think the reason they have to add the subtitle in the first place is because

1125
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,860
it's gonna be a series, would be my guess.

1126
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:09,300
But yeah, it's now actually being worked on by Platinum Games, of course the company responsible

1127
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:18,300
for such wonderful things like Bayonetta or, um, Madworld or, um, oh what was the other

1128
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
one?

1129
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,940
Which, funny enough, coming off the Saints Row 3rd discussion is kind of in that same

1130
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,740
bucket, where Bayonetta, again, sometimes you just want a big, stupid action movie,

1131
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,420
and don't get me wrong, Bayonetta is great.

1132
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,740
Bayonetta would make an awesome movie, and they have to.

1133
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,340
If a Bayonetta movie ever happens, Joe Pesci better fucking be in that movie, because if

1134
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,820
there's no Joe Pesci there.

1135
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,820
He's almost too old.

1136
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,820
They gotta hurry.

1137
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,820
No, no, no.

1138
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
He can do it.

1139
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,820
No, they need Mark Shephard.

1140
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,820
Who?

1141
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,820
Mark Shephard.

1142
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,140
Who's he?

1143
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,140
You don't want Supernatural.

1144
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,140
He plays Crowley.

1145
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,140
Of course I don't.

1146
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,140
He plays Crowley.

1147
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,140
I'm a 30 year old male.

1148
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,580
There's nothing in Supernatural for me.

1149
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,820
He's just, he's just, he would be perfect for that row.

1150
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,820
That role.

1151
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Fair enough.

1152
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,340
Except Joe Pesci is that role.

1153
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,020
Yeah, when I played the game, I thought Joe Pesci did, but if Joe Pesci was too old, then

1154
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,380
I guess whoever Dark Tiger is talking about.

1155
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,140
So but that'd be, that'd be awesome.

1156
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,260
But anyways, yeah, it's not a lot of details are released about this yet, other than the

1157
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,380
fact that, you know, New Studio is working on it now, and also it's supposed to take

1158
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:27,460
place now in the time period after Metal Gear Solid 4, and I guess you're gonna be doing

1159
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,420
like, mercenary work for different people and stuff.

1160
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,020
I heard, um, it's getting a lot of flack from the Metal Gear community because it's not

1161
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,680
a true quote unquote, Metal Gear game.

1162
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,980
But I'm kind of like, well, I mean, they've done a lot of spinoff Metal Gear games.

1163
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,760
And in my opinion, you know, I, I was kind of like, okay, whatever about this game.

1164
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,820
But now that I hear that the Bayonetta folks are involved, I've perked up a little bit.

1165
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,900
And I'm like, oh, they're serious about making an action Metal Gear game at this point.

1166
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,140
Because, you know, Bayonetta was a heck of a game.

1167
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,900
So I'm, I'm kind of interested in this, like way more than I was before, which is only

1168
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,980
a little bit.

1169
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,160
So you know, these things are going to happen.

1170
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,580
Are you going to be completely denied a Metal Gear Solid 5 because of this game?

1171
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,900
I don't think so.

1172
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,900
It'll happen eventually.

1173
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Yeah.

1174
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,780
So, um, yeah, I mean, come on, Kojima has even said that, you know, that they're going

1175
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,380
to be doing a five.

1176
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,220
He knows that people want a five.

1177
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,660
Jack Deft in our chat room says, simply screw the fans.

1178
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Rising looks awesome.

1179
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,860
I kind of agree.

1180
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
Yeah.

1181
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,180
If the fans of Metal Gear, whatever don't want it, then don't buy it.

1182
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,180
More for me.

1183
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
All right.

1184
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,720
Well, we were talking about the new Xbox live dashboard that rolled out this week and you

1185
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,460
might have not noticed this, but, uh, thankfully the internet was there to help you out.

1186
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:51,560
Uh, the terms of service for Xbox have recently updated where now you will not be able to

1187
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,420
essentially sue Microsoft as part of a class action agreement anymore.

1188
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,180
You might remember this conversation from a few months ago when Sony did the same thing

1189
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,100
in their terms of service, except there's kind of a difference in that is that, you

1190
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,260
know, Sony had that whole hack thing that went on a while ago and like actually had

1191
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,340
a reason that people might want to file a class action lawsuit, but Microsoft to our

1192
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,180
knowledge hasn't had anything happen.

1193
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,500
But then there's that part of me that goes, well, you know, people are getting, including

1194
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,060
yours truly are getting their Xbox is hacked yet Microsoft keeps denying that something's

1195
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,240
going on.

1196
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,060
Are they getting us to all accept this agreement here so that in 45 days, uh, they're going

1197
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,820
to announce it, you know, there was some type of breach or come be a little more forthright.

1198
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,820
Well, what's going on?

1199
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,180
Why everybody I know is getting their Xbox hacked that hasn't changed their password

1200
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,740
recently.

1201
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,740
So I don't know.

1202
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,540
I mean, would you really like go to a court and actually start a lawsuit against them,

1203
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:54,140
uh, or, well, I mean, I think if you're going to start a lawsuit against Microsoft, just

1204
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,140
do it on your own.

1205
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,700
I mean, I understand class action lawsuits are just so you, I think it's, it's a lot

1206
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,020
of the class action lawsuits are started by these lawyers that just want to make some

1207
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:09,100
money and you know, they just send out a blanket, noticed everybody and they're like, Hey, money's

1208
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,100
coming your way.

1209
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,020
And you're like, whoa, I don't have to do shit, you know, and I get free money.

1210
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,540
I mean, I think that's what happened with like grand theft.

1211
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,060
I don't even know if I ever got a check for grand theft auto.

1212
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,300
I don't really care cause I still had grand theft auto and um, I wasn't gonna, you know,

1213
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,620
San Andreas, the first issue with the hot coffee stuff in there, it's a cartridge as

1214
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,620
I am now.

1215
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:36,500
Um, I mean, I don't know, it's just kinda, it's kind of stupid.

1216
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:42,540
It's like, yeah, I can get mad about it and stuff, but if, if it really was so bad to

1217
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,380
where like I wanted to file a lawsuit, I would think that I would just do it on my own.

1218
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,860
I mean, and just go through the whole arbitration thing.

1219
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,140
And I kind of feel like a company, you know, should not be able to take that right away

1220
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,460
from you.

1221
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,140
If you really feel like you've been wronged, you should have the right to take them to

1222
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,140
a legal court.

1223
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,620
Like, isn't that granted in the constitution?

1224
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:04,540
If you have a excuse or if you have a settlement that's more than $20 in value, you have a

1225
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,300
right to a trial by jury or something like that.

1226
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:12,660
I think that they're actually, um, they're going to be doing some sort of, I want to

1227
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,940
say there has been some court cases or whatever, or places in the United States have found

1228
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,700
that those arbitration things can't be upheld in court or something.

1229
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,900
It's kind of like on both sides.

1230
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:28,620
I think there's been some cases that have gone in the favor of the whole, um, arbitration

1231
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,900
clauses and some against it and it's just which one has precedence or not.

1232
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,900
All right.

1233
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,100
Anyhow, um, I do want to point out, this is important.

1234
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,940
You can't opt out of this by the way, if you want to keep using Xbox live, you cannot opt

1235
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940
out of this.

1236
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,420
There was some rumor going around at first that it kind of had the postcard thing going

1237
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:49,940
on, but actually what's going on is that you can reject future changes to the arbitration

1238
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,580
agreement, but you cannot decline this one.

1239
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,840
So if you don't like it, you got to stop using Xbox live and I got to get this out here.

1240
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,560
This is the one other big thing I do not like about this is that because I can't opt out

1241
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,980
to these changes or what have you, that's kind of shady to me because of the fact that

1242
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,680
my Xbox live is already paid for in advance.

1243
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,180
So they're making changes to the agreement midway through is kind of, it's just, it's

1244
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,180
just shady.

1245
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,780
I mean, am I ever going to Sue Microsoft?

1246
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,780
Probably not.

1247
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,260
You know, it would be nice to know that if I had a reason, I'm sure that they've got

1248
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,140
it in the small text or whatever before when you're paying for your, your life that we

1249
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,180
can change this at any time, you know, and without notice and blah, blah, blah.

1250
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,620
You know, they have their lawyers covering their asses for this shit.

1251
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,420
Some, some States are taking action against these things too.

1252
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,180
So you know, maybe a matter of time before these types of agreements are illegal anyway.

1253
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,180
But I mean, look at it this way.

1254
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:48,900
I mean, honestly, I mean, look at, are any of you really gonna just like go after Microsoft

1255
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,480
and actually file a lawsuit?

1256
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,260
I think not made for the most case if, if it really, if they do something to you that

1257
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,420
really pisses you off, here's how you take care of it later on.

1258
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,060
You don't buy their next console.

1259
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:05,340
You just say whatever, if you smear them on the Internet like everyone else does or yes,

1260
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,340
mirror them on the Internet.

1261
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,740
Well, I'm just like, seriously, if it's, if it's so bad that you actually have to go and

1262
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:17,380
file a lawsuit against, you know, whatever company maybe Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, whoever.

1263
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,820
If it's, they're pissing you off that much that you just like, I gotta go file a lawsuit

1264
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,220
against them, then just don't buy their product.

1265
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,220
That's true.

1266
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Kick them where it counts in the wallet.

1267
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:32,140
I mean, cause a lot of people may go that route if there's something like, you know,

1268
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,940
if it comes out 45 days later, they're like, oh, you had to sign this arbitration clause

1269
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,380
and there's been this massive leak that you've been, you know, covering up.

1270
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,060
Trust me, they'll get it in the end.

1271
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,260
You know, someone will investigate and say, hey, what the fuck?

1272
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,300
You know, why are you having these people sign this?

1273
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,740
Oh, because you knew that you were going to get sued.

1274
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:56,900
So I mean, I mean just like, you know, people were worried about buying the 360 back when

1275
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,380
the whole red rain, you know, was going around.

1276
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,140
By the way, I was at a target the X, you get the other day with a new Xbox, one of the

1277
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,420
newer ones, red ring to e 68, not written, not red dot, excuse me, the red dot of death

1278
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,780
with an e 68 error.

1279
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Hilarious.

1280
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,260
Problem's still not gone.

1281
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,260
Just saying.

1282
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,260
Yeah.

1283
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,260
All right.

1284
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,260
Anyhow.

1285
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,480
So, um, there you have it.

1286
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,780
Take it or leave it.

1287
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,020
Get off Xbox live, I guess if you don't like it at this point, but I don't know at the

1288
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,780
end of the day, if I get pissed off enough, that agreement ain't going to stop me.

1289
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,780
And I don't think it can.

1290
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
I think that's only about class.

1291
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,780
That's a class action waiver.

1292
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,820
If me as an individual wants to sue Microsoft, I believe I can still do that.

1293
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,520
I don't think anybody can take that right away, but they're just going to make it very

1294
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,740
fucking difficult to do that.

1295
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,740
Of course.

1296
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,740
They just keep up in the end.

1297
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:49,800
You know, it's, it's just a, another case of the big guys, big companies trying to,

1298
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,540
you know, corporations or people.

1299
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,500
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

1300
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,780
Well, um, Epic, we know Epic, don't we?

1301
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:04,980
Well, um, they've announced a game for the Vita, the PS Vita, sorry.

1302
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:12,660
Um, and it is a zombie game called Fortnite, F O R T N I T E. And, um, there wasn't actually

1303
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,620
any gameplay shown in the trailer, but it said that it should all the characters picking

1304
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:23,040
up trash and scrap metal and bringing it back and then the zombies show up.

1305
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,700
So basically from what I understand is that it's preparing for a zombie assault and then

1306
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,040
the zombies come and you survive the assault.

1307
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,900
That would be awesome if it was like junkyard wars meets a zombie apocalypse.

1308
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,460
Well there's not too much else about it, like, other than, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean Vita,

1309
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:46,060
I just saw Vita add my bad, but it doesn't say exactly, you know, when or what or that

1310
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,620
it's going to be out, but, um, there should be more information soon.

1311
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,140
I don't know why, I'm sorry that I said it was on the Vita.

1312
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,820
More info in a Fortnite.

1313
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:04,940
Um, so there was another teaser trailer, in fact it was one that we were kind of, BioWare

1314
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,900
was doing a new game and everyone was like, oh, it looks like, you know, it's going to

1315
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,020
be a new Command & Conquer game because of all these, you know, website trademarks being

1316
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:17,580
registered and stuff like that, and yes, it ended up being a new Command & Conquer game.

1317
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,420
Bye BioWare, can Command & Conquer Generals 2, I almost forgot that there was a Command

1318
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:29,580
& Conquer Generals game, but it's set to come out 2013 on PC exclusively.

1319
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:36,300
It's going to be using the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which you may remember from Battlefield 3,

1320
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:42,100
which looked pretty awesome, so, um, very cool to check it out.

1321
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,780
I did not play the first Generals game, but I know it was a little bit different than

1322
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,340
the regular Command & Conquer game because I believe it was one where you're actually,

1323
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:55,540
um, if I remember correctly, you're actually playing as one of the troops kind of on the

1324
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:01,980
ground and you can still kind of, uh, control different things as well, but it's not just

1325
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,060
like an RTS game, like before, if I remember correctly.

1326
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,060
I could be wrong though.

1327
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:11,220
There might have been another Command & Conquer game that was also along the lines of that.

1328
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,380
It's very interesting to me that they are going PC only with this, especially with,

1329
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,840
you know, some developers saying we'll never make PC games again.

1330
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:24,500
I think it's just mainly because Command & Conquer is not very popular on consoles actually.

1331
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,100
It's just really more of a PC game.

1332
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,660
It's just, it hasn't done well when they've brought the last few to consoles.

1333
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,660
Makes sense.

1334
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
So, unfortunately.

1335
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:37,140
It's like Civilization, maybe, that it doesn't, well, I was going to say it doesn't translate

1336
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:42,000
well to consoles, but I actually think that Civilization Revolution game was pretty good

1337
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,320
for a console game, but it was a scaled-back experience, so it wasn't the same Civilization

1338
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
you really get on PC.

1339
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,020
It would be a good game, I think, if, I mean, RTS-wise, it would be a good game for like

1340
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,020
the Wii U.

1341
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:58,500
I mean, I think RTS games translate well for the Wii U with a, you know, a touch screen

1342
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,780
and you can move stuff around that way.

1343
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,180
That'd be kind of cool, because it'd be like playing, uh, what was it, uh, there was a

1344
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:15,660
Tom Clancy's, um, the Tom Clancy game, not End of War, but it was, uh, Rooz, where they

1345
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,980
had that actually playable on Microsoft Surface systems, and you could, you know, mess around

1346
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,980
with that.

1347
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,540
It'd be kind of similar to playing it on, like, a Surface or something, but you'd be

1348
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,820
playing it with the tablet, if you will.

1349
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:32,580
So I could see RTS is coming over there, but, yeah, it's just going to be right now PC only,

1350
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,660
and, you know, if it does well on PC, they may decide to try it again on consoles, but

1351
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,140
as of right now, it's just PC.

1352
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,700
And 2013 is when you can expect that.

1353
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,180
As a Command & Conquer fan, are you, uh, going to pick this up?

1354
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,700
No, I haven't played Command & Conquer, it's the first Red Alert game.

1355
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,340
I mean, that's how long ago it's been.

1356
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,700
That is a long time ago.

1357
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,700
So.

1358
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Alright.

1359
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,940
Well, um, going to one more game that was announced at the, um, you know, little thingy

1360
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,260
they did last night was, uh, a game called The Last of Us, uh, which is by Naughty Dog.

1361
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,420
Those are the folks behind Uncharted and, like, Crash Bandicoot way back in the day.

1362
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,140
Um, so this is a game that's coming out, I believe they said it's exclusive for the PlayStation

1363
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:16,060
3, and, uh, in the trailer, it even said that the trailer was, like, a live feed from a

1364
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:19,020
PlayStation 3, so I guess that's kind of neat.

1365
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:23,900
Um, and it's, I don't know what, like, kind of game they're going for, if it was, like,

1366
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,820
survivable horror or action, I think it's kind of supposed to be, like, a hybrid of

1367
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,820
the two.

1368
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,340
But for me, the trailer, and I'm going to play a little bit of the trailer here so at

1369
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,820
least you get some of the audio, the trailer to me looked a little bit, like, kind of like

1370
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:38,900
a mixture between, what's that Will Smith movie where he's alone in the world after

1371
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,300
the outbreak?

1372
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
I am Legend.

1373
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
Thank you.

1374
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,900
It looks like I am Legend mixed with, like, a father-daughter bonding thing going on here.

1375
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,220
Oh, daddy, you killed him just fine.

1376
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,460
Well, she kills one here later on in the trailer, so.

1377
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,420
There's kind of one coming up here.

1378
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,740
I'm proud of you, babies.

1379
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,580
And she looks like the girl from Juno, which is a little weird to me, so, like, is it just

1380
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,580
me?

1381
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,180
But you know the premise of this, right?

1382
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,380
It's that, um, bacteria, that fungus or whatever that they have, like, in, I think it's in

1383
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:14,460
the rainforest or whatever, that takes over actual, like, insects or whatever and infects

1384
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:20,860
their brain and then they eventually, um, I think die, it, like, controls their body

1385
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,860
almost.

1386
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,860
Wasn't that the plot to I am Legend?

1387
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,740
No, I am Legend was vampires.

1388
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,540
Or was that 28 Days Later?

1389
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,540
28 Days Later was zombies.

1390
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:28,540
Okay.

1391
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,740
I'm sorry, it was a disease, but it, you know, it's zombies.

1392
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:38,780
Okay, okay, so it's 28 Days Later mixed with I am Legend mixed with, mixed with Juno.

1393
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,780
I guess really the best I can tell you.

1394
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,780
I guess, oh, the graphics look good.

1395
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,860
If that really is real-time rendering or whatever, then it looks really good.

1396
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,740
Now, just because it's coming from a PlayStation 3 system, I kind of go, well, it could be

1397
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,020
just a Blu-ray movie.

1398
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,460
But if that is, like, really in real-time being developed by the engine, that's, I gotta

1399
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,820
say, a good-looking game.

1400
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,660
Uncharted 3 is a pretty sexy-looking game, so I could believe that that's real-time.

1401
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,660
Okay, point taken.

1402
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,940
So, and this is, by the way, just referencing Bobby's show earlier this evening.

1403
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:09,260
This is why he calls the game The Last of Us, because OFIS is all one word looking there.

1404
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,260
No, it's not.

1405
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:16,460
Yeah, I, yes, I can see that the kerning between the F and the U, speaking of F-U, speaking

1406
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,460
of F-U.

1407
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:22,740
You know what, but you did use, you did use the right term.

1408
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,860
I can, once in a while, Dark Soccer, this might shock you, once in a while, I have a

1409
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,220
smart moment.

1410
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,620
You know what I would have done, though?

1411
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,620
What?

1412
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,260
I would have moved the Us, actually, I would have kerned it a little bit differently so

1413
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,460
that the space with the T and the S would have been exactly the same, and that would

1414
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,620
have looked really hot.

1415
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,620
Hey, guess what?

1416
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,620
Hire me, people!

1417
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,620
I'm a good designer, really.

1418
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,620
Hey, guess what?

1419
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,620
What?

1420
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,620
No one kerr.

1421
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,620
All right.

1422
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,620
You know what, you know what I would have done differently?

1423
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,460
I would have called it The Happening 2, because that's really kind of what it is.

1424
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,380
It's plants taking over people.

1425
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,380
Plants versus zombies!

1426
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:59,060
Actually, you know what, The Happening, The Happening, if it was the fungus or whatever

1427
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:06,820
that makes people kill themselves, much like, you know, that fungus that kills ants or whatever,

1428
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:14,060
if it was like that instead of like, oh, it's leaf pollen that makes people murder things,

1429
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,620
that would have been a little bit more realistic.

1430
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,420
Wait, I just said more realistic?

1431
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,420
I'm sorry.

1432
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,780
It's a nice Shyamalan movie, it's not realistic at all.

1433
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,860
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says, every game could be better with Tim

1434
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,860
Curry in it.

1435
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,460
I don't know where that comes from, but yes, that would be absolutely true.

1436
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,640
In fact, if Pennywise the Clown was in this game, it would be the scariest video game

1437
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,340
of all time, quite possibly.

1438
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,340
You know what?

1439
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,500
Didn't we do a list list on this, and it was determined that Pennywise the Clown was like

1440
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,140
the number one character we want to see in a game?

1441
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,420
I didn't know LR Historian stat.

1442
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,420
Didn't we determine-

1443
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,380
That would guarantee I wouldn't play it, you know.

1444
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,540
As much as I love Tim Curry, clowns freak me the fuck out.

1445
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,540
That just means he's a good actor.

1446
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,540
I mean, think about it.

1447
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,540
No, no, no, no, no.

1448
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,540
Some of the scariest characters-

1449
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,380
Tim Curry, I'm fine with.

1450
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,940
Some of the scariest characters from your childhood were Tim Curry.

1451
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,940
Think about it.

1452
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:11,460
Pennywise the Clown, Darkness from Legend, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Rooster from Annie.

1453
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,660
I mean, he's a great villain.

1454
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,660
Tim Curry does need to be in St. Croix.

1455
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,900
But he was also in the Littlest Witch movie, and I'm sorry, not even Tim Curry could save

1456
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,900
that movie.

1457
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,180
It was bad.

1458
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,740
I vote, since you know Saints Row, the character can be anyway.

1459
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,660
I vote that he should be the head of the gang in the Saints Row movie.

1460
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,660
What, Tim Curry?

1461
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,660
Tim Curry.

1462
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,660
Absolutely.

1463
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,660
That would be awesome.

1464
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,660
That's right.

1465
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,260
It would be so random.

1466
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,740
As part of the marketing pun, they should never show who the leader of the gang is in

1467
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,100
any of the trailers.

1468
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,640
Just leave it up to the movie, and people find out it's Tim Curry.

1469
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,640
You know what?

1470
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,740
It's like the snazziest suit and everything, except they finally show his feet and its

1471
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,740
nine-inch heels.

1472
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,740
All right.

1473
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,740
Look.

1474
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:53,740
Moving on.

1475
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,740
We got another story.

1476
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,220
I do want to tease this, though, because we're getting towards the end of part eight, and

1477
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,420
this is important.

1478
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,260
If you have Mario Kart 7, get your 3DS out.

1479
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:05,540
Go to twitter.com slash O-L-R, or maybe somebody in chat will yell it out again.

1480
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,900
Add us to your community list, because we're going to try.

1481
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,620
I don't know how this is going to work, because I haven't played games online, but we're going

1482
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,620
to try during the break.

1483
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,780
I'm going to try and do a community race with you guys during tonight's break.

1484
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,860
So get out your 3DS, get on Mario Kart 7, and add the oil army community so you're ready

1485
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,660
to go in about 20 minutes when we get there.

1486
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,660
All right.

1487
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,700
So meantime, Dark Soccer's got some more news for us.

1488
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,700
Right, Dark Soccer?

1489
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Yes.

1490
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,700
About the Doctor.

1491
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,380
There's a Doctor Who game coming out.

1492
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:37,900
BBC let out a leak of the Doctor Who game for PS3, Vita, and PC.

1493
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,080
I'm totally going to play the hell out of this.

1494
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,580
It's called Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock.

1495
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:49,300
And you can basically play as the Doctor and River Song, and they go through the universe

1496
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:54,860
in different time periods, and hopefully there are some Cybermen and Daleks in it, because

1497
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,580
it's not a Doctor Who thing without Cybermen and Daleks eventually showing up in some form

1498
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,580
or another.

1499
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:05,020
Actually, I bet it's going to have the silence in it, even though the silence did get totally...

1500
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,020
Oh!

1501
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,100
Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

1502
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,420
But it's being built by Supermassive Games.

1503
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:16,740
They're the ones who did Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1504
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,940
And if there's a PC version, I really hope they do it for Steam.

1505
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:27,220
Wouldn't that be awesome if they had a LittleBigPlanet 2 download content pack that was the Doctor?

1506
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,220
That would be awesome.

1507
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:34,860
But then he'd just walk around Sonic screwdriver-ing everything and doing his timey-wimey stuff.

1508
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,860
I want a TARDIS.

1509
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:36,860
I have a TARDIS.

1510
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,860
Nice.

1511
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,460
I totally want this game.

1512
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,380
You know, one of our listeners in the UK sent me a Doctor Who game a while back.

1513
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,380
Yeah, I remember that.

1514
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,300
And it wasn't very good, from what I remember.

1515
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,140
It was Top Trumps or whatever the card game is.

1516
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,140
It was pretty fun.

1517
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,460
It actually was really fun.

1518
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,180
I had no idea how to play when I first played it.

1519
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:59,820
It was so foreign.

1520
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,820
It was so, so un-American.

1521
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,260
No, I'm kidding.

1522
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:09,580
It was actually pretty fun, but it had Martha in it, so I had to gag a little bit.

1523
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,780
Alright, we're going to travel around the world and check out release dates.

1524
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,980
Although we're getting to that time of year where if it was going to come out, it's out.

1525
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,700
But there's some coal at the bottom of the stocking if you dig enough, right, Loki?

1526
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,620
Yeah, let me see if I can do this all in one breath, because it's very, very small.

1527
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,900
Alright, here we go.

1528
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,900
US States, here we go.

1529
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:33,860
Alright, we have Outdoor Unleashed Alaska and Africa on the 3DS, Dr. Lork and the Forgotten

1530
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:38,260
Knights on the 3DS, and I Heart Geeks on the Nintendo DS.

1531
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,380
Well this is a big week for DS people.

1532
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,500
That was it.

1533
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,740
What's I Heart Geeks?

1534
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:49,580
I Heart Geeks is something that's from, remember Mark Echo and the crappy Getting Up game?

1535
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:52,660
Well Mark Echo is now providing some stuff for this I Heart Geeks.

1536
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,220
It's like, I think, The Incredible Machine or something.

1537
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,780
That was an epic game on the end.

1538
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,900
Yeah, yeah, it was an epic game.

1539
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,740
They kind of beat it into the ground.

1540
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,980
It's just not quite as cool anymore.

1541
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,980
I like the box art.

1542
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:05,980
It's cute.

1543
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:11,420
I don't even think they even have a trailer for it, but yeah, it's got some artwork by

1544
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,740
Mark Echo and that's about it.

1545
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,220
Alright, well let's go over to Japan and check out some release dates in Japan.

1546
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,220
I gotta say it's-

1547
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,060
Oh, and I'm sorry, the Oregon Trail 3DS, because I got delayed a week.

1548
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,060
Ha, you screwed up.

1549
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,060
That wasn't one breath.

1550
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,060
Alright.

1551
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,060
Well I said it last week, so that's alright.

1552
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,940
I gotta say, for those of you that like to import your games, especially, we'll get to

1553
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:34,020
PlayStation 3 in a minute here, because PS3 is a region free and all, it's a much more

1554
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,740
exciting week, if you can understand Japanese, because I'll tell you what.

1555
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,420
On the Xbox, we'll start with 360.

1556
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,900
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Final Fantasy XIII-2, I think there's a few people

1557
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,020
excited about that.

1558
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,080
That comes out on the 15th of December.

1559
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,060
Also this week in Japan, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend comes out this week in Japan,

1560
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:55,020
and Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, if you're into those fitness games.

1561
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:00,020
Final Fantasy XIII-2 here in the States will be coming out on the 31st of January, and-

1562
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,860
Not a bad delay, all things considered.

1563
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:10,900
And BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend would be on the 22nd, I believe, of February.

1564
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,180
Now PlayStation 3 in Japan has some of the similar stuff.

1565
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:19,060
They also have Final Fantasy XIII-2, but they're also getting a whole darn console in the Final

1566
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:24,200
Fantasy XIII-2 style, which is weird to me, because they did one for Final Fantasy XIII,

1567
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,180
and I would think any Final Fantasy person probably already bought it back then, but

1568
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,180
maybe I don't know.

1569
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,900
I guess this one's a slim, so maybe, I don't know, you need a twin-Z for your other PlayStation

1570
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,900
3?

1571
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:34,900
I don't know.

1572
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,900
But there's that this week to look forward to.

1573
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,060
There's also a couple other games, BlazBlue on the 17th as well, but there's a couple

1574
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:42,740
other games as well coming out specifically on the PlayStation 3.

1575
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:49,380
One of them is called Rayofu no Melt comes out this week, and that's an adventure game

1576
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,860
that stars anime chicks, so there you go.

1577
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:58,940
And then also Umeneko no Naku Koro ni San Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasuyoku comes out

1578
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:03,420
this week, which is, I'm reading the description here.

1579
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,540
Take another step closer to the truth.

1580
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:12,100
The game Battler plays with Beatrice is coming to an end in Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasukyo.

1581
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,340
I'm trying to think if this is something that exists here.

1582
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,880
Oh, it's another racing game, another sim.

1583
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,900
That may very well be, oh what the hell, they just announced a sequel to it too, it was

1584
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,420
a PlayStation 3 only game.

1585
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,560
There's chocolate cake involved, I can see from one of the screenshots here.

1586
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,560
Chocolate cake.

1587
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,340
This game actually has cake, unlike Portal.

1588
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,940
Well it's described as having vivid character illustrations and atmospheric music, soundtrack

1589
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:45,620
with 80 pieces of music in the game.

1590
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,660
So there you go.

1591
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,180
That is coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1592
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,060
So a more exciting week over Japan.

1593
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,940
I thought it was the game with the Soul Breed system, I can't remember what the hell it

1594
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,940
was called though.

1595
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:58,180
I had just set up the item too this week, but yet that really stuck in my mind.

1596
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,180
Can I get this out though?

1597
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:03,020
Do you know what else makes this week exciting in Japan, way more exciting than here?

1598
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:06,140
The PlayStation Vita is unleashed on December 17th.

1599
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:10,420
So before we have our next show, the Vita will be out somewhere in the world.

1600
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:13,300
And of course, lots and lots and lots of launch games.

1601
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,980
I don't really have time to read through them all, but the Vita and all its games are out

1602
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:17,980
this week.

1603
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:21,300
It's called The Augurist War, but I don't know if that was a record of The Augurist

1604
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:25,500
War 2, which is technically the third game, because the second game was a prequel.

1605
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,820
Alright, I'll tell you some of the games that are jumping out at me on the Vita.

1606
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:34,180
BlazBlue has a Vita port as well, which would explain why the release of the console ones

1607
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,580
has staggered a little bit.

1608
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,580
Katamari Damacy has a Vita game coming out.

1609
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,660
That I would recommend at launch because it's cheaper and it also has new levels and apparently

1610
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,060
it's pre-fun play.

1611
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,980
Michael Jackson, the experience.

1612
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,540
Not getting that over here at launch.

1613
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,540
Ridge Racer.

1614
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,420
Don't buy that.

1615
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,100
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1616
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,780
That's supposed to be pretty good.

1617
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,500
And Uncharted Golden Abyss.

1618
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,780
That's obviously really good.

1619
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:02,220
So Vita's got a really strong launch in Japan, so it'll be interesting to see how...

1620
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,780
Even stronger over here too.

1621
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,020
Also a Squeenix game called Lord of Apocalypse.

1622
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,020
But that's like...

1623
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,440
That's supposed to be awesome looking.

1624
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,980
That's like half the games coming out, so it's gonna be interesting to see how the launch

1625
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:18,900
compares to the 3DS launch when 3DS didn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's a

1626
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,580
lot stronger now.

1627
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,940
The PSP is not forgotten.

1628
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:25,180
Just for Dark Sakura, they are releasing on the PSP.

1629
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,180
It's actually the Dark Sakura edition.

1630
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,260
No, I'm just kidding.

1631
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:31,660
But it is Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd, low price edition.

1632
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,660
Yay!

1633
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,660
Budget bin edition.

1634
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,660
Woohoo!

1635
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,660
Yay!

1636
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:43,220
Trying to look at the Nintendo systems real quick, seeing what the 3DS is countering with

1637
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,220
this week against the Vita.

1638
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,100
Puyo Puyo Anniversary Pins Collection.

1639
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,800
And Inazuma Eleven Go, dark version and shine version.

1640
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,460
Both are out this week.

1641
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,940
From level 5.

1642
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,140
So that's a sports game.

1643
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
Puyo Puyo.

1644
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,140
Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.

1645
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,500
So a very busy week in Japan.

1646
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,980
Not so busy in the UK.

1647
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,260
On the 12th we have Gears of War 3 Ram Shadow.

1648
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:14,980
On the 13th is Flat Out 3 Chaos and Destruction for PC.

1649
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:20,900
And also on the PC on the 15th of December is X3 Albion Prelude.

1650
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,900
That's about it.

1651
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:27,660
I can't tell you what's coming out the week after that though.

1652
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,660
The Old Republic.

1653
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:33,660
Alright, we're going to get into some more news here in just a minute.

1654
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,740
We're actually, just for the podcast folks, we lost our live feed.

1655
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:37,740
Winamp crashed.

1656
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,780
That happens a lot lately around here.

1657
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,300
I can't figure out what's going on.

1658
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,940
If it's not Comcast, it's Winamp.

1659
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
I think they're in Kahoots.

1660
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,940
If you needed to upgrade a copy of Winamp.

1661
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,660
They're in Kahoots!

1662
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,660
Perhaps.

1663
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:49,660
I love that word Kahoots.

1664
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,340
Are they making new versions of Winamp?

1665
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,340
I think they do still make versions of Winamp.

1666
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,900
But anyway, we should be reconnected.

1667
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,900
So apologies to the live listeners and hopefully we didn't lose you guys during the week.

1668
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,260
I don't know how long we were down.

1669
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:04,720
I was so into reading those Japanese releases that Winamp could have been down for 5 minutes

1670
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,720
for all I know.

1671
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,720
So I apologize.

1672
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,020
I was really looking at it with such intensity on his face that I thought he was going to

1673
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,020
pop a vein.

1674
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,020
Seriously?

1675
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,020
Alright, wow.

1676
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,740
I think it was down for some time.

1677
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,740
Sorry guys.

1678
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,740
Rob Vail.

1679
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,740
Fired.

1680
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,740
No, you're not fired.

1681
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,060
Or you're rehired.

1682
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,980
I could fire you once and then rehire you.

1683
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:24,980
Alright.

1684
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,020
Let's move on with some more gaming news now that we have our live listeners back.

1685
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,580
Sorry, you just missed the release dates.

1686
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,580
Sorry.

1687
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,420
Yeah, there's like not much coming out.

1688
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,060
No, there's a shit ton in Japan.

1689
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,300
U.S. and U.S., U.K., not so much.

1690
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,300
Japan has the Vita release and a bunch of other stuff to go with it.

1691
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,540
People in Japan, send Jamie a Vita so she can review it and talk about you.

1692
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:49,540
I thought about buying a Vita from Japan and I thought it was $600 and I'm like, fuck that.

1693
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,540
No way.

1694
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,540
Sorry.

1695
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,340
Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Classic Game of the Week

1696
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,380
and of course our Mario competition soon.

1697
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:04,020
So Capcom is actually bringing over some Japanese indie games to PC for North America and Europe.

1698
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:07,420
And they're going to be doing some cool stuff.

1699
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:14,860
This is with a partnership deal with New Media, NYU, not new.

1700
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:21,120
And I guess they're going to be doing some neat, like a lot of, they call them retro

1701
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,500
chic arcade shooters.

1702
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:33,180
For example, they've got, looks like Satsa, Satsa, I can't even pronounce this, Sat-tazu-ts,

1703
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,180
yes.

1704
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:43,340
That's going to be coming out, that's available I guess as well on December 20th via Steam

1705
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:49,620
direct to drive Gamers Gate and other major digital distribution services for $6.

1706
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:58,180
And then coming early 2012, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, Ether Vapor remaster, Fighting

1707
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:06,100
Fairy, Exceed 2nd, Vampire Rex, and Exceed 3rd, Jade Penetrate Black Package.

1708
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,220
I'd play Fighting Fairy.

1709
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:13,980
And I'm going to take a wild guess and say those probably the last two there are shmup

1710
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:19,500
games because that kind of sounds very, you're a shmup, shmuppy.

1711
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,420
And yes, I would be accurate on that.

1712
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:29,740
Probably very complicated titles and Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, if that's a shmup I'm

1713
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:30,740
going to laugh.

1714
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,740
Nope, of course not.

1715
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,100
But that would be a funny name for a shmup.

1716
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,820
Fighting Fairy is the best name ever.

1717
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,860
It makes me want to kill Navi.

1718
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,980
Hey, listen, Squish.

1719
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:46,260
Yeah, Fighting Fairy is a fighting game, so they look pretty cool.

1720
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,260
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing some of that stuff localized.

1721
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:54,140
I mean, it's nice to see that they're bringing that over, even though they don't want to

1722
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:58,220
do a Mega Man game, but whatever.

1723
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:02,180
All right, moving on to just one more story here and then we're going to get to the classic

1724
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,180
game of the week.

1725
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:08,820
But first I want to talk about dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, OMG, a Microsoft

1726
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,100
app on an iOS device that makes it look like a Windows Phone, sort of.

1727
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,100
What?

1728
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,100
Here's the deal.

1729
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,640
My Xbox Live is a new app that is on the iOS App Store and it's a way for you to integrate

1730
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,180
with the new Xbox, you know, um, and this is nice because there were some like fan created

1731
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,460
apps or whatever, or unofficial apps that were decent.

1732
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:30,060
But now we have something kind of official and you can get on this app and you can see

1733
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:33,220
what friends are online, what they're playing, compare achievements, all that stuff.

1734
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,180
And what I think is kind of neat, you can send messages.

1735
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,620
You can actually send messages through the app to people on their Xbox.

1736
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,920
Can you play with your avatar?

1737
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,700
So like if Loki isn't listening, I think you can actually customize your avatar.

1738
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,760
You can, you can.

1739
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,720
So like if Loki isn't listening to you because he's too busy throwing carrots in Skyrim,

1740
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,340
you can actually pop it up on his screen through your iOS phone.

1741
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,340
Stop throwing carrots, dammit!

1742
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,420
Stop the carrots and pick up the phone and call me or something, you know, something

1743
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,420
like that.

1744
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,540
So that's pretty cool.

1745
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,380
And you can also delete friends from your phone.

1746
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,380
Woohoo!

1747
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,380
Yay!

1748
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,420
All these people I don't know.

1749
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,420
The app is free.

1750
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,420
So there you go.

1751
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,160
I should go download it now.

1752
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,540
And the app is also available on Windows Phones.

1753
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,740
Of course, of course.

1754
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,980
But it was just kind of funny that it made its way to the iOS app as well.

1755
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:23,100
And I believe the Windows Phone app will do slightly more.

1756
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,580
I think you can actually look through the catalogs of movies and apps and all that.

1757
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:29,540
You can queue up movies and control your Xbox using that.

1758
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,020
Right, which you can't do on iOS because if you sell things to the iOS store then Apple

1759
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,780
gets a cut and Microsoft's not having any of that.

1760
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,660
So you can only do that on the Windows Phone.

1761
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,260
Well no, I wouldn't see that they wouldn't be able to do that.

1762
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,180
It's just they probably, it's a little harder to, well actually I don't understand why it

1763
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,700
wouldn't be harder for them to do that.

1764
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,620
Because you can do that with like Comcast and stuff.

1765
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:53,940
I know I could, before when I was paying for like a DVR box and stuff like that, you could

1766
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,820
control the DVR using the iOS app.

1767
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,380
Now as Bobby Blackwolf says in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrager.com, Blackwolf says

1768
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,740
it's sluggish even on an iPad 2.

1769
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,740
Makes me sad.

1770
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,740
No voice messages.

1771
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,740
That's true.

1772
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:07,740
You can't do voice messages.

1773
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:12,420
I do realize though, like I just realized this recently, but the Kinect wires your whole

1774
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,400
damn room as a microphone.

1775
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,180
Like I can't find the charger for my little wireless headset.

1776
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,500
I had it for my Xbox so I have like no headset right now because the cat ate Alan's.

1777
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,400
So all we have is the Kinect and like when I'm playing apples to apples I can just talk

1778
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,400
to people.

1779
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,400
You can't find the charger?

1780
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,400
My normal voice, yeah.

1781
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,400
I can probably find it.

1782
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,400
I think I have a spare headset too.

1783
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,400
Woohoo!

1784
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,400
That'd be awesome if you have it.

1785
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,400
It's a crappy headset.

1786
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,400
I don't like those wireless ones.

1787
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,500
The cats apparently live on a diet of headphone wires and treats.

1788
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Don't they?

1789
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,220
They do it when we go to Disneyland and don't take them.

1790
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,580
That's how they act out.

1791
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,940
My cat likes to eat our artificial tree.

1792
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,980
She's just gnawing on it with the cords and stuff.

1793
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,820
It reminds me of like Christmas vacation with the cat chewing on the cords and plugging

1794
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,820
in.

1795
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,820
Hey, the Christmas tree's off.

1796
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:57,100
I don't think they chewed on anything when I cats sat last time.

1797
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,300
Well that's because you were coming over and giving them pettings.

1798
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,300
Yeah.

1799
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,300
And they were like, person, meow, meow, meow.

1800
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,940
Now they're being butt heads to me again.

1801
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,860
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1802
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:10,820
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to take a stroll down memory lane.

1803
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,420
Dark Soccer will dive into the vault headfirst and find a classic game that she says, hey,

1804
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:21,340
listen up you kids with your Skyrim and your I can't believe it's not Microsoft on an Apple

1805
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,340
phone stuffs.

1806
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,260
You need to go back to simpler times.

1807
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,460
We didn't have no cell phone to manage friends lists.

1808
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,420
We didn't have friends lists.

1809
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,260
Yeah, we just had friends.

1810
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,740
Back in the days of the Genesis.

1811
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,460
Yeah, we didn't play online.

1812
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,980
We just had people at our house and they ate all our pizza.

1813
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,940
So Dark Soccer, if the kids today want to know what life was like back then, she's going

1814
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,900
to hand pick one game that she thinks she kids should play.

1815
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,940
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1816
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,580
The classic game of the week is Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Say Saturn.

1817
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,580
Yay.

1818
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:52,740
Now, am I playing the intro here or just the...

1819
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,740
Okay, play, okay.

1820
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:54,740
This is what I have to do first.

1821
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,740
Okay.

1822
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,920
The game came out in Japan.

1823
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,660
It was based off of, it was based off the anime and they had to redo the intro.

1824
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,820
So I want people to hear the difference between the two versions.

1825
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,820
Okay.

1826
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,820
So play the English one first.

1827
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
Okay.

1828
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:12,980
Here is the English intro to Magic Knight Ray Earth.

1829
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:23,620
A bold, daring dream built of hope, found my chance into the deep end.

1830
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,620
Okay.

1831
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,620
That's enough.

1832
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,620
Play the Japanese one now.

1833
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,620
My music's going to make me poop.

1834
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:32,220
All right, here's the Japanese one.

1835
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:37,100
Come on.

1836
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:43,540
Here you go.

1837
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,380
Isn't that better?

1838
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,380
Not really.

1839
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,780
She sounds more like a cat in that one.

1840
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,260
Well, okay.

1841
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,780
But anyway, they had an even worse version and people complained so much.

1842
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,780
What, the German one?

1843
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,780
No.

1844
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,700
Just play music from the game.

1845
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,700
All right, fine.

1846
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,500
Here is music from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

1847
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,100
Well, anyway, there was a big anime series called Magic Knight Ray Earth, which was really

1848
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,100
awesome.

1849
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:13,580
The game was one of the pet projects of working designs and it was the last Saturn game that

1850
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:16,660
was released in the United States.

1851
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:20,300
It actually did not get localized for Europe.

1852
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:25,740
So this was a really, really big deal when it came out.

1853
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,380
Especially since working designs put so much effort into everything.

1854
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:35,380
But at any rate, you know, as far as an RPG goes, it was actually a very fun little RPG.

1855
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:40,300
You have different puzzles and you had, you sort of played as a tag team of your three

1856
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,760
main characters.

1857
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,420
You had Hikaru, Umi, and Fu.

1858
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:51,060
And basically they just, you know, they got kidnapped into Sephiroth to save the world

1859
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,680
as the Magic Knights and yeah.

1860
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,580
If you haven't seen the anime, then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because

1861
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,580
it's based off the anime, of course.

1862
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:03,500
So you upgrade through story progression.

1863
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:10,420
However you do get HP and MP, you know, your hit points and magic points are increased

1864
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,420
by finding items.

1865
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:18,020
But most of the character progress is done through story progression.

1866
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,660
It had really decent voice acting, I thought.

1867
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,020
It was all people from Redding, by the way.

1868
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,020
Did you know that?

1869
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,300
Because working designs is based off of Redding.

1870
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,300
Really?

1871
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,300
Yep.

1872
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:30,300
There ain't shit in Redding.

1873
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,300
You know what else?

1874
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,300
What?

1875
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,900
Our Twilight Zone Pinball was owned by the head of working designs.

1876
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:36,900
Oh, awesome.

1877
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,700
We got it from him, that's why we have one of the Goemon dolls from the game that never

1878
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,700
came out.

1879
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,700
Anyway, back to this.

1880
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,180
Yes.

1881
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,580
They have different weapons, usually the Magic Knights does.

1882
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:52,220
Hikaru has fire magic and she has a sword.

1883
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:57,540
Umi uses a fencing foil and her powers are all water and ice.

1884
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,100
I mean, her name is Umi, which means sea.

1885
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,660
And Hu is a bow and arrow and wind and healing power.

1886
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,500
So pretty cool.

1887
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,900
Fu actually, I think, is probably one of the most useful, you know, because once she gets

1888
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:15,740
her upgrade, she has this lock-on arrow thing, so that's pretty cool.

1889
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:20,620
So anyway, with the game that came out, working designs put a lot of effort into it, as they

1890
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:24,420
do with most everything they put out, because they've done a lot of treasure games, they've

1891
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:31,120
done a lot of Sega CD RPGs that we never thought that we would get.

1892
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:36,260
So when they did this, they actually, for the whole opening sequence, they did, for

1893
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:39,780
anyone who's seen the anime, the logo was formed out of these gems.

1894
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:46,240
And so they had a new logo made in English that came the same way, except Media Blasters

1895
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:51,140
had the rights to rare at the time they designed their own logo, and so they had to use that

1896
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:54,040
one.

1897
01:29:54,040 --> 01:30:00,540
The other problem, too, is that most of the source code for the Japanese version was lost

1898
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,540
due to a hard drive crash.

1899
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,540
They had to rebuild the game.

1900
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,540
Wow.

1901
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,540
Yeah.

1902
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:12,940
So the code that they were missing had to be completely rebuilt, like I just said.

1903
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,320
They did three different versions of the opening song.

1904
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:24,180
They were not allowed to use the original for the English release, so they had one with

1905
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:28,340
like completely different lyrics, they had the one that's in the game, and then there

1906
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:36,820
was an instrumental, but the CD that came out with everything had all the different

1907
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:37,820
versions on it.

1908
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:41,980
There was one that was just really hideous, by the way.

1909
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:42,980
So yeah.

1910
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,700
There weren't other Rayearth games for the record.

1911
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:51,740
There was a Game Boy one that was Rayearth II, The Missing Colors, Mahokishi Rayearth

1912
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:56,980
II, The Missing Colors is what it was, the Super Famicom, and two for the Game Gear.

1913
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,660
And the second one was called Making of Magic Knight, but the only one that came out in

1914
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,300
the US was the Saturn game.

1915
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:11,100
And there, I have to say, because I've seen, well, I've played through some of the Japanese

1916
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:15,160
one, and I've played, of course, the entirety of the US one, and there was a big improvement

1917
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,100
made, and I'll tell you what it was.

1918
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:21,900
In the Japanese one, every time you walked up to a play, and it does this in the US one,

1919
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,260
you've got dialogue, they make a comment on everything, except in the Japanese one, they

1920
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,060
said their comment too.

1921
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:31,900
It was like, wait to load, wait to load, wait to load.

1922
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,180
They really fixed some of the loading time issues.

1923
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:40,380
And on top of that, the packaging was amazing, and each of the discs, well, I would say that

1924
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:45,620
they had three different variations of the discs, one with Hikaru, one with Fu on it,

1925
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:51,820
and I think I have the mean one, I think my friend has the Hikaru one, Hikari, sorry.

1926
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:58,540
But anyway, it was really good, I mean, there were a lot of people who just thought it was

1927
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:03,460
kind of dull, you know, because it was a three year old game when it came out over here.

1928
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:09,340
But I think that if you're into a classic and fun RPG, this one's definitely one to

1929
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:12,060
check out, if you can find it.

1930
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,780
That's the other thing, it was the last Saturn game released in the US, it might be hard

1931
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:17,780
to find.

1932
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:18,780
Slightly.

1933
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,780
Slightly.

1934
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,780
Alright.

1935
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,780
It wasn't bad.

1936
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:26,060
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1937
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,180
It wasn't bad.

1938
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:31,020
Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Saturn.

1939
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,380
I did not know that they were all based in Redding.

1940
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,900
You know what else is in Redding?

1941
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,900
Trees.

1942
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,460
And lots of them.

1943
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:42,540
Alright, we are gonna take a quick break here, and it's gonna go down in Mario Kart right

1944
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,540
now.

1945
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:48,300
Get your DS's open, connect to the OL Army room, hopefully you've already added it there,

1946
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,300
and we're gonna get it started.

1947
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,580
We're gonna start it live here in just a minute, but I'm gonna break for the podcastees, put

1948
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,900
in a quick little break, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1949
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,140
Don't go anywhere though guys, we've got plenty more coming up in part B tonight, we've got

1950
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:04,700
The Last Story is coming to Europe, and we're gonna talk more about that and what it could

1951
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:10,100
possibly mean for America, and of course, a long time coming mailbag, and plenty more

1952
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:20,620
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1953
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:24,220
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1954
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:29,900
We are live with the second half of our 438th episode for this December the 11th of 2011.

1955
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:34,720
Alright, I know you're all dying to know how the Mario Kart matched with the whopping four

1956
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,060
people that joined in time went.

1957
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:45,500
Okay, so first race, I got last place, and I wasn't about ready to commit seppuku live

1958
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:51,500
on air because of it, but it happens, I just wasn't getting, and Loki's like, why aren't

1959
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,500
you drifting?

1960
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,340
I'm like, I'm trying, shut up.

1961
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,540
I redeemed myself a little bit in the second race, I was first place for most of the race,

1962
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:03,700
for most of the race, but then I did a stupid thing, and I tried to take the detour over

1963
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:08,860
to the big ramp, but you really, we were in the Kalamari, or was it Kalamari, Kala something

1964
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:15,980
desert level with the train, it's from the Nintendo 64 one, and I tried to take the shortcut,

1965
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:20,460
but the shortcut only works if you have a mushroom, and Black Wolf pulled ahead of me

1966
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,300
by mere inches and won the whole thing.

1967
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,860
Curse you Black Wolf!

1968
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,860
Curse you!

1969
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:30,140
So, but I got second place at least, although somebody, I think it was Zethur, somebody

1970
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:35,780
damn near took over right there at the end, but I was able to just inch out a second place,

1971
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:38,900
so that's much better than the last place I did the first time, so.

1972
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,180
Alright, so there you have it, there's your Mario Kart wrap up, we'll try that again next

1973
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,180
week.

1974
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,960
Loki's gonna bring his 3DS next week, right Loki?

1975
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,580
And then hopefully some of you guys can chat some more, you'll be able to purchase one

1976
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:48,580
next week.

1977
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,580
I had to get the game.

1978
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,900
I don't think you can do online play with download.

1979
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:52,900
Probably not with download, no.

1980
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:53,900
But that's alright, I'll play it.

1981
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,900
You'll have the game by next week.

1982
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,180
I've been planning on picking it up, but I was gonna do it this week and I just didn't

1983
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,180
get around to it.

1984
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,140
So, there you go.

1985
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:04,540
So I was like third place overall, with the fourth place and second place.

1986
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,140
So I wasn't last, I think Tiger Claw was last, sorry buddy.

1987
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:11,540
Might have been Zethur, I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.

1988
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,820
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

1989
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:17,700
We're gonna get back into the show here, we got plenty more news to talk about, and of

1990
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:24,220
course we have your calls, your emails, lots of emails tonight, and plenty more to come.

1991
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,220
So let's get back into some news.

1992
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,220
Loki.

1993
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:30,100
Alright, well let's talk a little bit about Grand Theft Auto, because we haven't done

1994
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,620
enough of that since I stopped playing.

1995
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:40,260
Grand Theft Auto 3, coming out on mobile devices next week for $5.

1996
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:46,580
And of course that will be out on iOS and also Android marketplaces, and is supported

1997
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:56,120
by most of the recent devices, including the Apple iPad 1 and 2, iPhone 4 and 4S, and the

1998
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:00,320
fourth generation iPod Touch, which thankfully I have.

1999
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:08,220
And also Android phones, the HTC ReSound LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Droid

2000
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:15,660
X2, Motorola Photon 4G, Samsung Galaxy R, and T-Mobile G2X, and of course some of the

2001
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,380
more recent tablets.

2002
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:23,960
And it looks fun, hopefully the controls work out pretty well, and definitely worth picking

2003
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:28,540
up if you've, you know, I don't know if it supports any Bluetooth controllers, that'd

2004
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,020
be pretty awesome.

2005
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:34,380
But I'm kinda curious to see how the game looks.

2006
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,140
But $5, so that'll be out on the 15th.

2007
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:44,660
And there's a neat rumor going around for the circle pad that's coming out for the 3DS.

2008
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:50,220
Apparently it's gonna run on a AAA battery for 480 hours.

2009
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:53,140
That's some interesting...

2010
01:36:53,140 --> 01:37:01,260
Yeah, that's a long time, and shit, you know what, Nintendo, you need to learn something

2011
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:07,100
about battery life, because man, those Wii remotes eat batteries like nothing.

2012
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:13,500
And this thing, I mean, I guess it just has like an IR relay in it, so maybe it just doesn't

2013
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,220
take that much.

2014
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:20,640
But beneath that's true, even half that would be pretty good, so.

2015
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:28,020
Nice to know at least I want to replace batteries like crazy, because I'm not buying it.

2016
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:34,460
And finally, Grasshopper and Digital Reality, they have a game coming out called Symora,

2017
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,420
or Cine Mora, I'm not sure how they're pronouncing it.

2018
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,060
And it's now gonna be an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive.

2019
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:45,120
It was supposed to be kind of a horizontal shmup game that was with 3D graphics and stuff,

2020
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,540
and kind of a little bit different than Grasshopper, I mean, it's not strange, like, you know,

2021
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:52,420
a lot of the stuff that they normally put out.

2022
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:56,060
So that's kind of cool that it's gonna be coming out exclusively, though, on Xbox Live

2023
01:37:56,060 --> 01:38:02,140
Arcade, and not sure now if this is gonna be a timed exclusive, or if it's gonna be,

2024
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:06,980
you know, exclusive permanently, but it's still neat, it looks like a pretty awesome

2025
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,340
looking game, especially if you're a shmup fan.

2026
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,140
And then of course, they also have another exclusive game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

2027
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:18,140
called Diabolical Pitch, which is really weird, I don't know if you remember seeing it, it's

2028
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:23,260
like a zombie survivor horror game, kind of thinking House of the Dead with baseball,

2029
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:30,340
where you're throwing baseballs at zombies, and hitting stuff, and I mean, okay, that's

2030
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:34,860
kind of more of the Grasshopper stuff, where it's just really weird, but uh, that'd be

2031
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,860
pretty cool.

2032
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,940
They need to adapt Battlefield Baseball, because that was a fucking awesome movie.

2033
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:47,020
All right, oops, I'm not ready for that story yet, be quiet, all right, moving on with some

2034
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:50,580
more news, some rapid fire news, well I guess I'll start with that, since the music popped

2035
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:54,740
up in the background here, what you're hearing there, that's the music, I think this is music

2036
01:38:54,740 --> 01:39:00,860
from the port, it's a Commodore 64 port of the game Cannibal, which to me looks a lot

2037
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:06,160
like Bit.Trip Racer, or the, what is it, Magic Unicorn game, Comedy Central, that's

2038
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,160
on the iPhone.

2039
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,500
Yeah, this was kind of the first of that series, I think.

2040
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,540
Yeah, but the music kicks ass, listen to this.

2041
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:23,380
I mean, that kicks a lot of ass, now I don't think that's actually the Commodore 64 rendering

2042
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:27,580
that, I think that's an MP3, but that's, that's, I mean, the type of stuff that 64 would make,

2043
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,820
and that's a pretty badass sounding song, but yeah, somebody has actually ported the

2044
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:33,540
game to the Commodore 64, that is awesome.

2045
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:36,980
So you can Google that to find it, because the link's a little bit complicated, but it's

2046
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:43,860
C64ANABALT, and you can, it's being distributed pretty much as freeware, so you can play it

2047
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,020
in an emulator or what have you.

2048
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,220
Or just look at the YouTube, it's YouTube user HeavyStylus, and you can just hear that

2049
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,020
sweet music that's playing there in the background.

2050
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:57,380
All right, some other news for you guys, somebody dared to sue Beyonce last year, remember this?

2051
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:02,260
A $100 million lawsuit against Beyonce, there was supposed to be a music game that was gonna

2052
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:06,660
be created all around her, but I guess for whatever reason she stopped it, and 70 people

2053
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:09,700
lost their jobs over the whole thing, well, you know, think about it, they have that Black

2054
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:14,180
Eyed Peas game, there's an ABBA dance game, I mean, it's not, there's Michael Jackson,

2055
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:19,140
so it's not unheard of that Beyonce might have her own dance game, but it was stopped,

2056
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:24,620
and they're now suing Beyonce for $100 million, and I think a lot of people went, hahaha,

2057
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:25,620
that'll be a laugh.

2058
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:31,100
Well, guess what, the lawsuit was around, allowed to move forward, it was not thrown

2059
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:37,740
out of court, so, interesting to see what happens with this as it moves further.

2060
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,580
Sounds like it might have been a breach of contract kind of thing, huh?

2061
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:43,860
This whole thing started a year ago, just to give you an idea how slow the project's

2062
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,860
moving, so, anyhow.

2063
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:51,020
One other thing that'll be of note to our longtime music game fan folks that, you know,

2064
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:56,020
have listened to the show for a long time, there is a new cell phone, smartphone version

2065
01:40:56,020 --> 01:41:00,200
of Dance Dance Revolution that's going to come out here next year.

2066
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,180
It doesn't have a name yet, but they're saying it's gonna be DDR, and it's supposed to have

2067
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:08,260
an emphasis on social gaming, which is ironic, because this whole show started because Dark

2068
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:12,100
Soccer Loki and I all met playing DDR, it was a very social thing when it was in arcades.

2069
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:16,920
I don't know how you're gonna play DDR on your phone, I think it'll be more like a response

2070
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:22,420
to Tap Tap Revenge, which is clearly inspired by this title, if you know what I'm saying.

2071
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,820
Inspired by, with quotes.

2072
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:28,500
Anyhow, yeah, they're saying it's gonna be more of a social game, and it's in Konami's

2073
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:35,060
social thing such as Dragon Collection, Sengoku Collection, Professional Baseball, Dream 9,

2074
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:39,440
and they're saying it does very well on social networking sites, so we'll see how it does

2075
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,980
over here.

2076
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,620
So that'll be coming out next year.

2077
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,620
Dark Sakura!

2078
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:49,260
Well, we have some Tekken Tag Tournament 2 stuff.

2079
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:54,420
The field tests are going on in the US for an arcade version.

2080
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:59,100
So five different arcades across the US, that's Next Level Arcade in New York City, Round

2081
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:03,800
One Entertainment in City of Industry, California, Super Arcade in Walnut, California, Thudworks

2082
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:09,460
in Honolulu, and Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas.

2083
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:14,820
Also, it's supposed to be coming to consoles, it says Holiday 2012.

2084
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,820
There's a bunch of holidays.

2085
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:19,020
So this is probably gonna be Arbor Day.

2086
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:26,460
Also Mario Kart 7 sold 420,000 units its first week in Japan, and Iwata said that it did

2087
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,260
even better across the world.

2088
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,960
So that's pretty good, huh?

2089
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:31,960
Very nice.

2090
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,420
Good news for the 3DS.

2091
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:39,660
Last bit, we have some good news for Rock Band fans.

2092
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:40,660
Rush!

2093
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,660
Yay!

2094
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:46,660
It's the Rush Pack 01 that has Fly By Night, Caravan, and the Spirit of Radio, the live

2095
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:52,060
version, and then individual songs, Rebel Love Song by Black Veil, Brides, and Warriors

2096
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,340
Call by Volbeat.

2097
01:42:54,340 --> 01:43:00,380
And there is a pro bass and guitar expansion available for Fly By Night and the Spirit

2098
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,620
of Radio.

2099
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:05,620
I like Rush.

2100
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,620
Rush is a good band.

2101
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:10,340
You know, that was one of the songs that I was using to test out everything, was Tom

2102
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,340
Sawyer.

2103
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,340
Nice.

2104
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,340
I was like, I can't sing that high.

2105
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,780
It was pretty funny.

2106
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,780
All right.

2107
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:21,220
Well, we're gonna get back into some long gaming news here with Loki, but I wanted to

2108
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:25,540
plug this first because I promised in chat earlier, Derek, one of the other hosts here

2109
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:29,620
at All Games Radio does his own show, Dead Pixel Live, wanted me to plug this.

2110
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:30,620
And I said, sure.

2111
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:34,640
Because I said last time when we didn't participate, because none of us had the game, we would

2112
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,640
try to do the next one.

2113
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:39,380
And I think the prospects for us participating here look much better.

2114
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,660
It is the big battle beat down.

2115
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:46,740
It is a fighting game tournament that's gonna take place against a bunch of like radio shows.

2116
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,420
I don't think it's just restricted to all games.

2117
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:51,340
I think Derek's gonna try and get whoever he can to be a part of this, but certainly

2118
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,300
we would like the OL army to be a presence.

2119
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:57,820
If you want more information, more information is available at thebigbattle.net.

2120
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:00,460
I haven't had enough time since I just kind of found out about this tonight.

2121
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:04,300
I haven't had enough time to go through and look at all the specifics, but I can see that

2122
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,780
there are several games that will be involved here.

2123
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:11,620
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat as in the new one, Street Fighter III

2124
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:16,740
3rd Strike Online, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, so a couple Street Fighters and a couple

2125
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:17,740
Mortal Kombats.

2126
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,740
I kind of like the way that was done.

2127
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,860
You have like the new one and you have the classic one.

2128
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:25,340
So whether you're a new gaming fan or a classic gaming fan, there's something for you here

2129
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,960
where you can represent the OL army.

2130
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,960
So that'll be fun.

2131
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,500
I don't know what platform the games are on, or if they're gonna do it multi-platform style

2132
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,140
somehow, or if it's like gotta all be on 360.

2133
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:40,180
But we'll try to get Derek on in the coming weeks, and I think this is not starting until

2134
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,900
next year.

2135
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:45,140
So soon.

2136
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,140
But check it out.

2137
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:48,580
You can sign up in advance at TheBigBattle.net.

2138
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:53,700
I'm gonna sign up and participate at least in probably the two Mortal Kombat games.

2139
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,780
I think I could do Super Street Fighter IV.

2140
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:56,820
Here's my problem though.

2141
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:59,660
All of them I own on PlayStation 3.

2142
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:03,660
Well, no, I have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox, so I might be able to do some of

2143
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:04,660
these.

2144
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:05,660
We'll see.

2145
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:08,420
So we'll figure it out as time gets closer.

2146
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:11,180
Derek might be in chat too to clarify some of this later.

2147
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,860
But I wanted to give a plug for that, because I do want to participate.

2148
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,300
So prepare to get your ass kicked, DarkSakura.

2149
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,300
Alright.

2150
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,300
What?

2151
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,300
I'm gonna kick your ass.

2152
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:20,300
No.

2153
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,300
No, leave my ass alone.

2154
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:22,300
Yes, I am.

2155
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:23,300
Alright.

2156
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:24,300
Let's get back into some other gaming news.

2157
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:26,100
Lowkey.

2158
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:31,060
It's been announced that the last story is coming to Europe.

2159
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:37,380
Another one of the Project Rainfall games ported over to English for European players.

2160
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:45,380
It's coming out February 24th, and of course no announcement about a North American release,

2161
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,980
but hey, at least you get another game, Europeans.

2162
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:52,380
Another Mistwalker game.

2163
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,500
And that's fantastic.

2164
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,660
Apparently it's pretty good.

2165
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:58,860
That means there will be an English translation ready for America to pirate.

2166
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:01,020
Very soon.

2167
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:05,460
Which is what I plan to do if they don't announce this anytime soon for the US.

2168
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:10,540
If they're willing to put the US version out within three months or so of the US release.

2169
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:11,540
I'll wait.

2170
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,540
I don't understand why they can't announce that.

2171
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:19,140
I mean, they could say, hey, they're doing the English translation already, once again,

2172
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:24,340
it requires either no translation or maybe one person working on it for maybe a week

2173
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:32,140
at the most to translate English to US English or American English.

2174
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:38,940
And honestly, it's fine to replace, I mean, it's so stupid that you know what a jumper

2175
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:39,940
is.

2176
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,660
Do I know what a jumper is?

2177
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,660
Do you know what a lift is?

2178
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,660
Yes, I know.

2179
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:44,660
Do you know what a lorry is?

2180
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,660
A lorry?

2181
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,660
A lorry.

2182
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:47,660
A lorry?

2183
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:48,660
I don't care.

2184
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:49,660
It's a truck.

2185
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:50,660
I thought it was a Hue lorry.

2186
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:55,380
Well, how many lorries are in the last story, which is a story that took place a long time

2187
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,220
ago, even though it's the last one.

2188
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,220
I don't know.

2189
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:02,340
Hey, they can have the last story if we can have the final fantasy.

2190
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:08,040
Seriously, how many final fantasies have we had a bajillion?

2191
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,340
This is the final fantasy we're up to as of right now.

2192
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,340
We're up to 13.

2193
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,340
Two of them put out.

2194
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:14,820
Oh no, wait, we have 14.

2195
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:18,740
We have 13 to zero and we have 10 too.

2196
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,740
And we have mystic quest and crap.

2197
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,540
We have a lot of spinoffs.

2198
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,200
It's just what you counted.

2199
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,540
Mystic quest.

2200
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:27,740
You played it.

2201
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:30,060
Actually, I ain't even going to lie.

2202
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:33,780
I loved mystic quest, but a majority of that was the music was really good for not having

2203
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,780
been done by Nobuyomatsu.

2204
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:37,460
The music in mystic quest is great.

2205
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:42,400
But yeah, like, you know, I'm not going to beg and plead for the last story.

2206
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,940
And if honestly, if it's on something that they just decide, Hey, we're just going to

2207
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:50,020
put this out, you know, I got, I'm hoping that there's an announcement within like a

2208
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:56,320
week or two because it's ridiculous otherwise, I mean, all you're going to do, I mean, unless

2209
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:01,020
are they just going to wait and see how, no, they can't wait and see how the sales are

2210
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:07,480
of, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles or whatever it is because it's not coming out until April.

2211
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,300
So, you know, I don't know.

2212
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:13,420
I mean, yeah, it may come out over here, but once again, I'm not, I'm not going to rush

2213
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:21,500
out and go get this because I don't know, like it's so easy to import via piracy.

2214
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,740
I mean, so yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to just be straight up real.

2215
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,540
This is my real answer.

2216
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,580
Again it goes that whole kicking them in their wallet thing.

2217
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:33,400
Like the ultimatum, if you want to call it is if you don't release it here, I will find

2218
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:38,180
a way to obtain the Europe one, whether it be legal or more nefarious means in three

2219
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:44,220
months, you get three months to localize it, then I'm done and pirating it if I have to.

2220
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,820
That's honestly how I feel about it.

2221
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:48,360
Like if you don't want my money, then fine, I won't give it to you.

2222
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:53,980
But I'm sick of this whole, like what they're doing with Xenoblade is just, I mean, I still

2223
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,460
don't know what to do about that whole thing.

2224
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:59,900
Like I really want to buy it and support it because it's a great game, but I'm really

2225
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:00,900
irritated.

2226
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:05,180
And I think ultimately the end of the day I'll buy it while I'm irritated at two things.

2227
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:09,340
One, I'm irritated that it's this whole exclusive thing with the evil G, which I hate.

2228
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:12,000
However, I do understand you can order it from Nintendo.com.

2229
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,700
So if, if it's Nintendo shipping it to me and not evil, it's still stupid.

2230
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,220
Why is it exclusive to a retail?

2231
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:22,980
I mean, I understand that they may have ponied up money to help import it over fine, whatever

2232
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,980
that, that's fine.

2233
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,620
That should have been an issue in the first place.

2234
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:27,140
Yeah, actually you're right.

2235
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,140
It shouldn't have been an issue.

2236
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:31,720
They, uh, a company shouldn't have had to say, hey Nintendo, we're going to pay you

2237
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,300
money to localize it over here.

2238
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,740
You don't have to fucking localize it.

2239
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:39,100
You have to bring it over here and you know, you, you send a copy of the ESRB so you can

2240
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,820
get rated, which is just standard.

2241
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:46,540
And you just put it out over here cause you're publishing, it's first party publishing.

2242
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:49,700
Case in point, and I don't think anybody can talk me out of this one.

2243
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:53,100
Dark soccer is on the orange launch tumblr right now, orange launch radio.tumblr.com

2244
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,460
looking at a game called magical jewel pet or something like that.

2245
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:01,320
If this can be, if somebody is paying for this to come out on the DS, then somebody

2246
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:07,140
can pay for Xenoblade and you can't convince me that Xenoblade, there's something to it

2247
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:12,620
that makes it a bigger, more expensive to do because it's already been translated.

2248
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,460
I don't understand.

2249
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:17,060
Like there's so much shovelware that comes out on these systems.

2250
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,980
There's no room for Xenoblade in this.

2251
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:24,580
I don't understand what the, if you've got it translated in English, I mean, I understand

2252
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:27,900
if it's a Japanese game that they're just not going to translate into English.

2253
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,900
Okay.

2254
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,900
Yes.

2255
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:33,260
There's an issue there that, you know, bringing it over here may be unrealistic, but if they're

2256
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:39,500
already translating it to English and releasing it in a different part of the world, I don't

2257
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,500
understand.

2258
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,840
There's no work you need to do.

2259
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,840
It's done.

2260
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,180
It's English already.

2261
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:52,940
You don't need to translate anything you can't, I mean, last time I checked when you put translate

2262
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:56,800
English to English and like Google translate, it comes out the same.

2263
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,780
So I don't, I don't understand what they would need to do.

2264
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,180
Can I ask this too?

2265
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:04,000
What's just, what's wrong with a region free system?

2266
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,960
Like for real, like what, why can't our system just be region free?

2267
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,620
Like has Sony PlayStation three been hurting because it's region for three free.

2268
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:16,840
Are we having like rampant issues, like just tons and tons of people getting all their

2269
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,900
games from Japan because of, of the region free thing?

2270
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:23,220
No, I think the big fucking, I would think if anything, it helps them out.

2271
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:27,140
The only time that they may have issues where they're maybe losing out a little bit and

2272
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:32,100
not everyone's going to go import stuff because, uh, you know, it's expensive to import some.

2273
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:35,940
You're paying almost twice the amount of money that you had paid to buy it locally.

2274
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:40,780
Um, and just for, you know, gain, but a lot of times people are buying like stuff that's

2275
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:44,780
not going to come out over here or, you know, RPGs that they want a special edition of or

2276
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,780
something like that.

2277
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:49,220
It's not coming out in the United States or North America or whatever.

2278
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:54,060
Um, and I mean there's some European games that get released over there first, you know,

2279
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:58,960
like there's maybe some IOS games or a little Square Enix games that are going to be released

2280
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:59,960
over there.

2281
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,900
You know, I'm fine with Europe getting the game a little early.

2282
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:07,460
I mean shit, they, they get screwed with stuff for us all the time and for them this is a

2283
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:08,460
great thing.

2284
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:11,540
So I get it, but it's just kind of one of those whole things where it's like, you know,

2285
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:16,380
at some point they have to realize, thanks to the internet, we live in a global world.

2286
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:24,140
I mean, so far all the Sony systems from like the PSP, the PS3, and now the Vita is supposed

2287
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,140
to be region free.

2288
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:31,220
I mean, DS was region free and then they decided, eh, let's poo poo on that.

2289
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:35,900
And now, you know, the 3DS, I'm just waiting for them to come out with something to, you

2290
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:38,820
know, like a card reader for the 3DS.

2291
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:43,960
I'm sure there's one out there already, I haven't looked, but, um, cause I mean, that's

2292
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,220
the only way you're going to get stuff.

2293
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:48,300
And then you get homebrew and stuff and people modding games, which is kind of cool.

2294
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,940
And I can go have, you know, a good and bad thing.

2295
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:54,940
And then the Xbox 360, believe it or not, is actually region free for a lot of games.

2296
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:58,700
You just have to do your research to find out which ones, but there's some games that

2297
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,700
you can play.

2298
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:04,220
Like, uh, there was the Conan game that came out a few years ago.

2299
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,420
That actually came out in Europe a lot earlier than it came out over here.

2300
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,900
Not necessarily a game that you would want to get early, but, I mean, if you wanted to

2301
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:16,060
play like a God of War knockoff game, and it was pretty fun, um, earlier than you would

2302
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:20,760
get it here in the States, you could, if you wanted to pay the money to have it imported.

2303
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:25,660
I mean, I don't know, I've done that before with, uh, some of the other Final Fantasy

2304
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,420
games, but not necessarily on PS3.

2305
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:30,980
Alright, I feel like it's just another week and it's the same old rant.

2306
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:32,060
When will Nintendo learn?

2307
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:33,060
I don't know.

2308
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,420
Because it seems like Nintendo's also the biggest offender when it comes to Europe getting

2309
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,420
things late too.

2310
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:40,660
Yeah, and here's my problem though with this.

2311
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:45,580
I don't want to buy this game because, one, it's, I understand if I buy the game that's

2312
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:50,840
supporting the fact that niche games like this do have a place in the United States,

2313
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:55,400
but at the same time it also supports the fact that I'm okay with them making us beg

2314
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:59,300
for this game and then having to jump through all these hoops to get the game over here.

2315
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,240
So it's kind of like a double edged sword there.

2316
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:06,180
I don't know if I should do that or not, and honestly my choice is I don't play my Wii

2317
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:09,720
very much so I'm just not going to buy the game.

2318
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:16,140
And I have a feeling though a lot of these other publishers are kind of doing this, Capcom,

2319
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:20,100
and they're just making people jump through hoops to get a fucking game out of here.

2320
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:24,420
For a franchise, not necessarily a franchise right here, but I mean this is a game that's

2321
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:27,500
going to do well with the RPG crowd.

2322
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,020
I mean you can't expect this to be, Final Fantasy, I mean hell, a Final Fantasy game

2323
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:35,460
or something like that is not going to appeal to everyone, fuck, Skyrim is not going to

2324
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,460
appeal to everybody.

2325
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:40,820
I mean, mom and, your people that are playing Wii Sports and stuff like that don't give

2326
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:41,820
a fuck about Skyrim.

2327
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:45,380
They're just like, they would blow their mind, they're just like, I don't know what to do

2328
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,380
with this.

2329
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,380
Too many buttons.

2330
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,380
Exactly.

2331
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:49,380
It's like my wife trying to play it.

2332
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,260
I can't look, I can't adjust the camera and move the character at the same time.

2333
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,420
So I mean it just blew their mind.

2334
01:54:55,420 --> 01:55:02,300
So you can't look at it doing as well as like a, you know, a Mario game.

2335
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,900
I mean it's just not going to appeal to everybody.

2336
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:06,060
But you have to look at the RPG crowd.

2337
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:10,060
It's got to do better than like Princess Jewel Pet or whatever, you know?

2338
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:11,740
Yeah, I know, it will do better than that.

2339
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:14,900
And there's a lot of like Wii games I think that sell based on like box art.

2340
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:18,820
It's like people are like, oh that's a game my son would like or my grandson would like

2341
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,820
and I'm going to buy it.

2342
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,700
And I, yeah, there's a lot of crap out there.

2343
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:25,700
Alright.

2344
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,700
Let's move on.

2345
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,940
We've got to move on with more stories or we're going to be here all night.

2346
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:31,760
So I want to talk about a story about the PlayStation Vita.

2347
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,780
It's not about region free and all that stuff.

2348
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:34,780
Is the Vita region free?

2349
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:35,780
I can't remember.

2350
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,780
It's not.

2351
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:37,780
It's supposed to be.

2352
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:38,780
It's supposed to be.

2353
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,780
They're saying that it is but I don't think anyone's really gotten one.

2354
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:41,780
We'll find out soon.

2355
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:44,860
Obviously there's, it's only out in one region and no one's really confirmed either way.

2356
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:45,980
I think it is.

2357
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,900
Alright, we'll find out soon.

2358
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,420
Well some of the rabble that was going on this week, thanks to a NeoGaf post, because

2359
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:56,700
NeoGaf has huge forums and a lot of people post there so sometimes there's some interesting

2360
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,780
leaks and things that come out there.

2361
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:04,300
And apparently one of the posters was at a PlayStation Vita event in Japan this week and

2362
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:11,400
apparently the information said that only one user account can be used on the system.

2363
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:17,140
So if you tend to share your gaming systems, like say Alan and I do, or Jamie and Dan share

2364
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:20,860
all their gaming systems, I'm sure, or Loki and Nellie share their gaming systems.

2365
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:21,860
We do.

2366
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:25,620
Well, what system did you try to teach Nellie?

2367
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:27,780
Was it Nellie's copy of Skyrim you tried to teach her?

2368
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,860
No, I don't share portable systems.

2369
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:36,700
Oh, see, well, Alan uses Netflix on the 3DS all the time.

2370
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:40,380
Like he uses Netflix more than I do because he really gets a lot of use out of the 3DS

2371
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:41,380
thing.

2372
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:47,540
But then he'll also play my copy of Mario Kart on my save file, which is okay, it's

2373
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:48,540
fine.

2374
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,540
He's unlocking some stuff.

2375
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:53,900
Like it works great for a game like Super Mario 3D Land where you have three save files.

2376
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:54,900
I'm number one.

2377
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:55,900
He's number two.

2378
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:59,420
And if I ever let a friend come over and play the game, they can have save file number three.

2379
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:00,420
It works out great.

2380
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,420
Oh, that's right.

2381
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:02,420
He told me to write over save file one.

2382
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,420
Shut up.

2383
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,420
It's true.

2384
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:09,500
But anyway, my point is that some people do, especially couples and stuff will tend to

2385
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,580
share these systems a lot.

2386
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:18,300
So when they heard that only one user per system, it was a little bit of an alarm.

2387
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:23,580
However, there was a follow up article that came out very quickly afterwards.

2388
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:28,760
And that is the official line from Sony America quote, your PlayStation network ID is bonded

2389
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:34,220
to your memory card and your memory card is bonded to your Vita.

2390
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:40,340
So in other words, you can have multiple PlayStation network accounts, each tied to a memory card.

2391
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:45,460
But if you try to move the account from one card to another, it's going to get more interesting.

2392
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:49,060
And we just had the story last week about all those memory cards now freaking expensive.

2393
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:50,060
They are.

2394
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,060
Yeah.

2395
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:52,060
So it's yeah.

2396
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:53,060
Like good news and bad news.

2397
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:54,060
Good news.

2398
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,060
Yes.

2399
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:56,060
You can't have more than one account.

2400
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,060
Bad news.

2401
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,460
You're gonna have to buy more memory cards to do it.

2402
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,700
And then you can't just move them from one Vita to another.

2403
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:01,700
It sounds like.

2404
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:02,700
Yeah.

2405
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:06,460
I mean, honestly, I don't like the fact that they're tied to your to your Vita.

2406
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:10,740
I don't see how that's necessary because what's the point in having a memory card then?

2407
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:16,340
I mean, I guess someone was saying, well, I can't take my memory card from, you know,

2408
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,300
one Vita and play it on my friend's Vita.

2409
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,580
But it's like, why would you do that?

2410
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,420
Just take your Vita with you.

2411
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:25,540
But I don't know if it's really a problem that a lot of people have.

2412
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:30,940
It sucks that they're doing this, tying it to the system and stuff because and it's just

2413
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:37,480
bad for Sony because this is a problem that will be solved by hacking, unfortunately.

2414
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:44,940
And only creating these problems creates people that want to find the solution for it.

2415
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:49,900
And the solution is not good for Sony, unfortunately.

2416
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:53,220
Allen's in chat right now, and his feathers are a little ruffled at what I said about

2417
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:54,220
Mario Kart.

2418
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:57,780
He says, Salacious Pops in chat saying, well, I always win and unlock shit.

2419
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:59,500
So, you know.

2420
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,100
Maybe he's better than better than you at drifting.

2421
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:03,540
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps.

2422
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:04,540
Shut up.

2423
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:08,060
I almost considered asking you if I could play your second match.

2424
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:10,140
Oh, I wouldn't let you.

2425
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:11,140
I could.

2426
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,140
Oh, man.

2427
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:15,140
We got to maybe next week, if you don't have your own copy by then I'll let you race during

2428
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,140
the midpoint break.

2429
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:17,140
All right.

2430
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:18,140
Anyway.

2431
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,800
Also, I want to point out what the Rob D is saying in our chat room and chat that orange

2432
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,800
on Twitter.com.

2433
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,800
Yeah.

2434
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,340
Japan has a totally separate set of standards when it comes to this sort of thing.

2435
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:28,140
They don't care whether lots of people buy their stuff.

2436
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:29,780
They care about making money.

2437
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,100
They will not price niche media and aim for the most sales.

2438
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:38,940
They will price niche media for the passionate people and gouge them.

2439
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:39,940
I mean.

2440
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:40,940
Okay.

2441
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,940
Listen.

2442
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:42,940
Ironic.

2443
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:46,180
This is coming right after the Xenoblade last story stuff about gouging niche people.

2444
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,180
Listen.

2445
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:49,420
I understand that, you know, the memory cards.

2446
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:50,420
Okay.

2447
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:51,420
The memory cards are what they are.

2448
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:56,420
You're either going to just buy one and just get over the fact that they're fucking expensive

2449
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:58,500
and just buy one because guess what?

2450
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:04,140
The PSP Memory Stick Pro Duos were fucking expensive when they came out and that shit

2451
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:09,460
came down in price once, you know, other peripherals and stuff were using them.

2452
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:10,460
Yes.

2453
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:11,580
It's a proprietary card.

2454
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:12,660
Just get over it.

2455
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:15,380
Buy your fucking four gig card or whatever the hell.

2456
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:16,380
Trust me.

2457
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:19,940
You're not going to need more than four gigs for the system unless you're downloading a

2458
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:23,960
ton of games online, in which case you can, you know, think about maybe getting a bigger

2459
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,960
one later on.

2460
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,100
But, I mean, for me, if I was going to get a Vita, whatever, I'm going to be the only

2461
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,100
one using the thing.

2462
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:34,460
So, it's not a big deal for me and yeah, it sucks for people that want to share.

2463
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:39,860
It's not the end of the world, in my opinion, is that, you know, as far as, you know, let's

2464
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:43,220
say at Alan and I's house where we're both, you know, big gamers and nerds and stuff,

2465
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:45,020
I can kind of say, obviously, I'm getting a Vita.

2466
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:48,940
I mean, no question because I have to have all the nerd stuff and, you know, it's going

2467
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:52,020
to be, I think, a good system, got a lot of good games coming on it.

2468
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:55,620
As far as the save file goes, I at least like the fact that, you know, we could get Alan

2469
02:00:55,620 --> 02:01:00,060
a cheap little memory card for his saves and then he can have his own PlayStation Network

2470
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,060
ID.

2471
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:04,520
Or, at the end of the day, if it's really just save files, I mean, if a game will still

2472
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:08,940
give you three save slots or something on one memory card, then, you know, or a lot

2473
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:11,980
of Sony games kind of let you save an unlimited number of files.

2474
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,900
Like I have like seven saves on White Knight Chronicles 2 just because it just keeps adding

2475
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:16,900
to the list.

2476
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,180
Skyrim, I think I have six or seven saves too.

2477
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:19,180
These are all on PS3.

2478
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:23,740
So, he can just have his own saves and I don't think he's going to really care about trophies

2479
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:24,740
on his own account.

2480
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:25,740
Maybe he will.

2481
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:29,380
Well, here's what I'm worried about and here's why I think the reason why they're doing this.

2482
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:33,780
It's like on the PlayStation 3, if you download, say download content or whatever, everybody

2483
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:35,540
I think on the console can use that.

2484
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,540
Oh, no.

2485
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,340
I know where you're going with this.

2486
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:41,700
And so, now, they're going to get you, oh, hey, you like that download content.

2487
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:42,700
Well, fuck you.

2488
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,540
You're going to have to buy it for yourself instead of sharing it.

2489
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:46,780
That is kind of shitty actually.

2490
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:51,300
So, that's kind of what they're doing I think with this.

2491
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:54,420
But like once again, you know, listen, it is what it is.

2492
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:57,260
You either either just get over yourself.

2493
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:58,260
You either support it or you don't.

2494
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:01,220
Yeah, you either get over yourself and buy the system or not.

2495
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:05,500
I mean, is that really going to hold you back that you got to buy an expensive memory card?

2496
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,100
I don't have to like it and I can complain on the internet.

2497
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,900
I mean, just deal with it and that's it.

2498
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:16,620
I mean, it sucks and I'm sure there will be a third party work around.

2499
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:21,020
But, I mean, unless you really want to wait for that, and you know what, hey, there's

2500
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,460
nothing wrong with waiting.

2501
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,980
Yeah, everybody's going to be buying, well, not everybody, but a lot of people are going

2502
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:26,980
to be buying it at launch.

2503
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:27,980
But guess what?

2504
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,820
You know, prices come down, there's bundles that come out later on, you get a bunch of

2505
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:31,820
free shit.

2506
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:35,220
So, just wait if you're unsure about it.

2507
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:39,660
Wait until the following holiday season and stuff and you might score it even cheaper

2508
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,660
than it is now.

2509
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:44,200
We're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute here, but I want to read one more

2510
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,300
comment from chat from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.

2511
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,300
He's trolling.

2512
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:49,300
Listen to this.

2513
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:55,180
Bobby Blackwolf says in chat, you mean I could have beaten both Sky and Loki at Mario Kart?

2514
02:02:55,180 --> 02:03:00,200
I think he's throwing down the gauntlet there a little bit.

2515
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:06,580
Could have if you were good enough to beat me.

2516
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:07,580
It's on.

2517
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,720
It's already been brought in.

2518
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:09,720
I like this.

2519
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:13,620
I think we need to do more of this where we play games either right before, well, I don't

2520
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:16,500
want to say before because we don't want to step on Bobby's toes, maybe right after OLR

2521
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:17,620
during the midpoint break.

2522
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:20,380
I like the idea that people can kind of play games or even during the show.

2523
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:23,540
Shit, I don't care if you're playing Mario Kart right now and like listening to OLR.

2524
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:27,540
We'll have to play after his show because we don't want him crying during his show.

2525
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:36,420
Uh oh, uh oh, alright.

2526
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:42,660
Moving on, on that note, let's get to the mailbag.

2527
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:43,660
Thousands and thousands of emails received.

2528
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:48,080
You have to remember, this is the first mailbag since all the website outage stuff.

2529
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,140
So our emails have been piling up.

2530
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:52,300
So unfortunately Dark Sakura can only pick a few.

2531
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,780
Dark Sakura has sifted through the mailbox like it was kitty litter, has sifted through

2532
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:00,900
the mailbox and pulled out a few nuggets for you.

2533
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:01,900
You know what?

2534
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:06,060
There's this one Caturday picture that I kept seeing on the web of a cat standing up looking

2535
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:13,060
super surprised, saying, someone keeps coming in and stealing my poop!

2536
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:15,060
And you just made me think of that.

2537
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:18,980
So let's see who's poop we've stolen.

2538
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:23,220
The first one, hi OLR, it's me again, your friendly, catastrophic Moggy.

2539
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:25,820
I know it's been a while since I last emailed.

2540
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:29,780
After listening to your last show and Rob Stark contrasting with Skyrim and Final Fantasy

2541
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:35,620
13, the two show clearly the difference between western and Japanese RPGs.

2542
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:37,860
Western RPGs mainly focus on character creation.

2543
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:41,060
You're lucky if you get to even pick a name in a JRPG.

2544
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:42,060
And world exploration.

2545
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:46,780
While JRPGs focus on story and character drama leading to a much more linear affair.

2546
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:50,180
Also Rob, have you played either of the first two Elder School games?

2547
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:52,220
They're both now available as freeware.

2548
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:55,860
If you think Skyrim is big, you should check out Daggerfall, which boasts a game world

2549
02:04:55,860 --> 02:05:00,140
twice the size of Great Britain that would take over two full weeks to cross in real

2550
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:01,140
time.

2551
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:02,960
Yeah, but it's all just an algorithm generated thing.

2552
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:08,500
Of course it is all randomly generated, so it's quite, all quite samey.

2553
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:11,620
Before I go, I just wanted to pass on some preview footage of a game to you because I

2554
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:13,100
know how much you love the series.

2555
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:16,220
I bet it will be 20% cooler than any other game.

2556
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:17,220
Hear you later, Moggy.

2557
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:22,060
And it is Silent Ponyville, the game.

2558
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:23,060
Nice.

2559
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:24,060
Oh, can you send me the link for that?

2560
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:27,940
I want to, I want to, just copy paste and chat so we can, I want to see this Silent

2561
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:28,940
Ponyville.

2562
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:29,940
Silent Hill.

2563
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:30,940
Hold on.

2564
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,940
But with my little pony or something.

2565
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:36,860
Um, and just real quick on the whole, uh, um, earlier Elder Scrolls games.

2566
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:40,180
I haven't really played them a lot in depth, but I'm kind of familiar with them.

2567
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:45,420
And I especially know the older like PC RPGs, how they used to be like they'd be vast, but

2568
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:49,540
the dungeons weren't quite as visual as they are now.

2569
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:53,540
Like people like Skyrim because not only is it big, but it looks real.

2570
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:55,460
Like the, the graphics are getting so good.

2571
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,460
All right.

2572
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,020
Um, I'm going to fast forward here a little bit.

2573
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:59,020
Silent Ponyville.

2574
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:01,620
It's exactly what it is.

2575
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:06,780
It's a silent Hill meets my little pony.

2576
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:07,780
Is there a pyramid head in this?

2577
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:11,180
It comes out and chops her head off.

2578
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:14,460
This is like some of these art project that they spent a lot of time making.

2579
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,660
Not sure how to feel about this.

2580
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,660
Next email.

2581
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:20,660
Hi, OLR.

2582
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:23,060
Doesn't seem to be anything going on there.

2583
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,540
Brave about ready player one.

2584
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:29,260
I was all ears being myself, rather old gamer started with the C64.

2585
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:33,700
So I bought myself a copy and I've just started, but it really is a page turner.

2586
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:36,100
If you have the chance, do get the author on your show.

2587
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:40,700
I'm certain that that will result in a very interesting podcast.

2588
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:43,260
Best regards from the UK, Mark.

2589
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,540
Uh, so we'll try.

2590
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:47,700
I forgot to look into that, but we will.

2591
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:48,700
Our listeners can read.

2592
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:49,700
Yes, of course they can read.

2593
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:52,100
How dare you insult the listeners from the UK.

2594
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,340
So I'm assuming you can read.

2595
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:59,060
Therefore he's more well educated, more, more, more better, more smarter, more smarter, more

2596
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:00,780
better, gooder reader.

2597
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,420
Um, okay.

2598
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:04,860
Hey guys, this is blade three, AKA Sam one.

2599
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,860
Well, what are you blade three or Sam one?

2600
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:08,500
Oh no, Sam.

2601
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,320
He's not using any punctuation.

2602
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,320
So whatever.

2603
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:17,140
I just wanted to say to Loki that Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly

2604
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:18,140
like Rob.

2605
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:20,660
It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.

2606
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:22,580
Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.

2607
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:23,580
Keep up the good work.

2608
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:24,580
The show is fantastic.

2609
02:07:24,580 --> 02:07:25,860
I've been listening since I five thanks to you guys.

2610
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:29,700
By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut

2611
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:30,700
some slack.

2612
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:31,700
Oh, exclamation point.

2613
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:37,460
Seriously, that's the only, okay, I'm going to reread this email the way it's written.

2614
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:38,460
All right.

2615
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:41,400
Hey guys, this is blade three AKA Sam one.

2616
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:45,740
I just wanted to say that Loki Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly like

2617
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,740
Rob.

2618
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:47,740
It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.

2619
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:49,540
Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.

2620
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:50,540
Keep up the good work.

2621
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:51,540
This show is fantastic.

2622
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:52,540
I've been listening since I five thanks guys.

2623
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,840
By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut

2624
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:56,840
some slack.

2625
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:57,840
Go.

2626
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,840
So cut some slack.

2627
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,840
Oh yeah.

2628
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:00,840
Why aren't you cutting some slack?

2629
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:01,840
Oh, all right.

2630
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:02,840
I don't know what the fuck's like.

2631
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:05,900
Oh, I have heard the, um, Laszlo comparison before.

2632
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:06,900
Actually.

2633
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:07,900
You're not the first to mention it.

2634
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:08,900
Funny enough.

2635
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:11,420
I haven't played enough grand theft auto where I know that.

2636
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:14,220
I know it's like the one game series I don't play enough of.

2637
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,300
So um, I'll just have to take your word for it.

2638
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:21,100
I would love to loan my voice to a game sometime though.

2639
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,060
Maybe when they do legend of the magical pony too.

2640
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,060
All right.

2641
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:27,060
Yeah.

2642
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:28,060
I want to be in a game.

2643
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:29,060
Rob.

2644
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,060
I'm going to do voice acting.

2645
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:31,060
I think it would be fun.

2646
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:33,340
I think that we would be awesome voice actors.

2647
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:35,260
I think so too.

2648
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:39,620
So um, we should do, we should get a video game script and reenact it live on OLR.

2649
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,620
We could do that.

2650
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:45,380
You know, if we wanted to get someone with the fun voice just on the show randomly, we

2651
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:47,500
should get agro on here.

2652
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:52,620
We should get, do dramatic reading of eight bit video games, strip scripts, but we should

2653
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:54,740
get agro on here sometime to do his announcer voice.

2654
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:55,740
Oh God.

2655
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:56,740
Oh God.

2656
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:57,740
That guy from wow.

2657
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,740
Oh God.

2658
02:08:58,740 --> 02:08:59,740
So cool.

2659
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,740
Why?

2660
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,740
Hello.

2661
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:02,740
Hi everyone.

2662
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,020
I just finished listening to November's internet outrage ridden podcast and it's one time I'm

2663
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:08,420
glad I don't listen live.

2664
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:09,420
Oh yeah.

2665
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:10,900
Well I'm not going to read it.

2666
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:12,220
No, sorry.

2667
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:16,780
Anyhow, being an avid Android gamer, I wanted to chime in with my suggestions for your Twitter

2668
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:22,300
topic poster all reviewed in 140 characters or less ish so dark soccer can read them without

2669
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:25,180
having kittens because that just makes sure me feel inadequate.

2670
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:26,180
Well, that's okay.

2671
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,180
Cause sure.

2672
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,180
Me can't have kittens anyway.

2673
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:29,180
She's too old.

2674
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:30,180
Her uterus fell out.

2675
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:32,700
No, that got yanked out when she was a kitten.

2676
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:33,700
Okay.

2677
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:34,700
Angry.

2678
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:35,700
She's looking now.

2679
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,700
She heard her name.

2680
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,700
She heard her name.

2681
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:38,700
She's like, you talk about my uterus.

2682
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:41,860
She's like, girl, I haven't had a uterus since.

2683
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:45,180
What's uterus talking about Willis?

2684
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:49,100
How many times can we say uterus in one radio show?

2685
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,100
Angry birds.

2686
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:54,340
If I had my eggs, I'd go after them too, so have a fling and smash those pigs asphalt

2687
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:57,940
five 3d racing with accelerator support for older models in a GT clone hub.

2688
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:02,860
You have a study rests asphalt HD graphics update for higher end devices and tablets.

2689
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:07,880
Now with more cars, new tracks, repetitive stress, wrist injuries, battle heart, addicting

2690
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:11,980
dragon attack action with challenging battles in a variety of party and equipment options.

2691
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,980
Not much of a story though.

2692
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:16,700
You getting her on the radio?

2693
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:18,740
I'm trying to get sure me to review the games.

2694
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,220
You hear me?

2695
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:21,220
Hey baby.

2696
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:22,220
All right.

2697
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:23,220
No.

2698
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:24,220
Okay.

2699
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:25,220
Yes.

2700
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,220
That's how I talk to my cat.

2701
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:27,220
Um, bonsai blast.

2702
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:31,380
Japanese Zen flavor Zuma clone with high replayability value for those five minute potty breaks for

2703
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:33,500
peace and calm are oh so important.

2704
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,620
Dr. Stanley's house one and two point and click mystery game.

2705
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,420
You misspelled mystery by the way.

2706
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,500
With a twist ending ported from a flash game.

2707
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,500
Duck hunter.

2708
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:44,780
Think SNES classic minus the dog with really funny foul play.

2709
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:46,260
Ah, I see your pun.

2710
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:47,260
Haha.

2711
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:48,260
Fruit Ninja blah.

2712
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:49,260
Yeah.

2713
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:50,780
Care for fruit salad and have a minute to lose.

2714
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,060
Flick at your screen and get as many fruits before the time runs out.

2715
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:54,060
You'll have a blast.

2716
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:57,700
You're still trying to make my cat talk.

2717
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:58,860
I'm rubbing her belly.

2718
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:00,300
She likes it.

2719
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:02,900
Hexa dictus hexagonal match three puzzle game.

2720
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:03,900
No, really.

2721
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,900
That's about it.

2722
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,900
Kid mode.

2723
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:09,300
Great for parents with kids two through 10 with edutainment options galore activity reporting

2724
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:12,060
family muffin night.

2725
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:13,900
What the crap game is that?

2726
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:15,480
Pumpkins versus monsters.

2727
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,480
It's a clone.

2728
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:17,480
Um, you know what?

2729
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:19,180
I'm not reading the rest of this.

2730
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:23,140
Um, well hopefully at least one of them sparked your listeners or your interest.

2731
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:24,140
Listen to you next week.

2732
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:25,140
Dr Noir.

2733
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:29,660
Well, I wanted to hear more about pumpkin whatevers, but our soccer was like, no smiley

2734
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:31,660
pops.

2735
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:38,780
PSS email is written at 5am while waiting for a delayed flight back to Mexico at a Colombian

2736
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,420
airport with no coffee available.

2737
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:41,980
I know ironic, right?

2738
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:43,620
After four straight 15 hour workday.

2739
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:45,700
So if I misspelled something, blame it on the exhaustion.

2740
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:51,420
Okay, I forgive you this time and I'll, I might go post your list later.

2741
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:54,500
I'll put it on the tumbler eventually.

2742
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:57,860
Xbox has followed in the footsteps of PSN network.

2743
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:00,140
That's redundant, isn't it?

2744
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:01,140
PSN network.

2745
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:03,300
That's like ATM card or pin number.

2746
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,100
Are you thinking ATM machine?

2747
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,100
Yeah.

2748
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:07,500
ATM machine and pin number.

2749
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:08,500
Yeah.

2750
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:13,580
Um, I've linked an article though I actually didn't hear about it from them.

2751
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:18,300
My husband is in law school and he actually reads the terms of service before he agrees.

2752
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:22,460
Anyway, the overall impression he gave me was this is a crappy backhanded move, but

2753
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:25,780
as far as crappy backhanded moves go, it's not so bad.

2754
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:29,260
Essentially while they block you from class action, they agreed to pay all fees associated

2755
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:34,420
with arbitration and formally agreed to pay a thousand dollars or what the arbitrator

2756
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:37,500
decides is fair, whichever is greater.

2757
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:38,500
It's still crappy though.

2758
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:41,540
And that's from Holly D.

2759
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:42,700
It's still crappy.

2760
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:43,700
It's still crappy.

2761
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:44,700
But I agree.

2762
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,700
Less crappy.

2763
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:48,220
Uh, this is from Robobobobobobobob.

2764
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:51,860
I sent the following email to my state's consumer protection division of the attorney general's

2765
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:52,860
office.

2766
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:53,980
I'll let you know what they reply.

2767
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:58,940
I did discover that my mandatory arbitration can be disputed if you feel treated unfairly.

2768
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:02,900
Oddly enough, it would take something extraordinary for me to want to sue a game system manufacturer.

2769
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,900
And it's from Robobobobob.

2770
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:05,460
Like I just said.

2771
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:06,980
And this is the email.

2772
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:11,220
I give this guy massive props for actually doing something about it though.

2773
02:13:11,220 --> 02:13:17,340
Lately, video game console manufacturers are updating their EULAs for operating their game

2774
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,860
systems with mandatory arbitration clauses.

2775
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:26,900
Are there sources of information on what clauses are allowed in EULAs and what clauses are

2776
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,940
invalidated by Maryland law?

2777
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:33,420
As for my own opinion, it doesn't seem wrong, no, it seems wrong that an expensive electronics

2778
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:37,340
device can be rendered useless if you don't agree completely with the EULA.

2779
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:40,860
Thanks for any response, Robobobobobobob.

2780
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:43,620
That's not how he signed it, but I'm still saying it.

2781
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:45,660
I still want to see what reply.

2782
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:46,660
Okay.

2783
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,660
And, um, that's it.

2784
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:49,660
All right.

2785
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:50,860
I mean, that's not it.

2786
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:54,180
Of course, for emails, we got a bajillion emails.

2787
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:55,500
It's been building up for like a month.

2788
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:56,500
Keep in mind.

2789
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:57,500
But I ain't reading anymore.

2790
02:13:57,500 --> 02:14:01,220
But if you would like to be considered for next week, we read them all at least mailbag

2791
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:03,580
at orange lounge radio.com.

2792
02:14:03,580 --> 02:14:08,140
And by the way, you have a better chance if your email is like concise, just so you know,

2793
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:09,860
because the run on ones are a little harder to read.

2794
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,580
So there's one more I want to read from Robobobobob.

2795
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:12,580
All right.

2796
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:13,580
It's older.

2797
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:15,460
The Peeta Tanooki suit thing is still topical.

2798
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:17,780
I'll show you my thesis on this.

2799
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:19,460
I love how he writes, though.

2800
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:21,940
Peeta is intentionally grabbing negative attention for donations.

2801
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:24,460
It has nothing to do with what they are trying to protect.

2802
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:29,020
How better to get attention by being negative publicity about a beloved icon?

2803
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:30,020
Peeta's logic is this.

2804
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:33,100
An imaginary character wears an imaginary suit with special powers.

2805
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:37,940
This Tanooki suit resembles a Tanooki fur, which a Tanooki is a mythical creature burglarized

2806
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:39,900
as a raccoon dog.

2807
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:44,380
So the imaginary prospect of killing an animal is bad slash evil, so send money.

2808
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:48,940
Peeta is pretty famous for flinging fake blood on real furs to demonstrate the cruelty of

2809
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:51,300
the fur industry and equating fur with murder.

2810
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:54,660
So their fake blood is that of a fake animal or worse, of a fake human.

2811
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:57,940
By their own logic, they are advocating animal slash people slaughter.

2812
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:01,140
I think Jamie said it best, which she said a few weeks ago, Peeta is crazy.

2813
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:04,060
Of course, that's why people love picking on Mickey Mouse, too.

2814
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:05,940
Okay, that's it.

2815
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:06,940
All right.

2816
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:09,700
We're back at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2817
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:12,780
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because it's our show

2818
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:15,980
and sometimes we have angst and we have to get it all out in a segment called The FUs

2819
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:33,220
of the Week.

2820
02:15:33,220 --> 02:15:40,580
A big FU goes to the increased militarization of national police forces and to there not

2821
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:46,580
being enough change in the way people vote to where we still have assholes in office

2822
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:53,060
and also to assholes running for office who like to wear the same jacket from Burbank

2823
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,060
Mountain.

2824
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,060
Uh, Logie.

2825
02:15:55,060 --> 02:16:03,940
Fucking in my radio in my car because apparently the track skip forward button is starting

2826
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:09,900
to break and so sometimes it thinks, or actually most of the time now, it thinks I'm hitting

2827
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:17,380
track backwards and then sometimes it thinks I'm also changing the mode of my, you know,

2828
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:20,140
player to play the radio or something like that.

2829
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:23,100
Or sometimes it will actually work and go forward.

2830
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:28,700
So that fucking sucks because now it's making it very difficult to pick the song I want

2831
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:29,700
to listen to.

2832
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:35,540
Alright, my FU, uh, first one goes to Rick Perry because he's such an assbag and I have

2833
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:36,540
a right to say that.

2834
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:39,100
I believe that Rick Perry is an assbag.

2835
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:40,100
And you know what?

2836
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:45,620
I imagine when you said assbag, he was actually the bag that attaches to a colostomy.

2837
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:51,900
That's pretty much what he is and just, just discussing and gross and insulting the way

2838
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:53,260
he's pandering people.

2839
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:54,380
It's just insulting.

2840
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:58,180
So just, I don't know, barf barfy barfs.

2841
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:03,620
Did you see the thing that Santorin said, Oh, that guy, he's even bigger of an idiot.

2842
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:04,700
Oh my God.

2843
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:05,700
So many.

2844
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:11,580
And like, I'm really trying not to be like all one side or the other, but like, let me,

2845
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:17,260
here's the nice thing I can say about the dog and pony show that's going on over there.

2846
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:23,460
Some of them know when to keep their mouth shut and that's, that's a good compliment,

2847
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:26,540
but some of them need to learn such humility.

2848
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:32,740
It's just, so anyway, um, without getting too political, whoops.

2849
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:37,560
But my other FU, I will say that's a little sillier is FU to, um, FU to the fact that

2850
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:42,660
in looking for raid in world of Warcraft, um, that only one piece of gear has dropped

2851
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:43,660
for me.

2852
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:47,540
Can I add to that too FU to that pug last night.

2853
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:51,140
You need, you need to do what I do and start writing down their names and servers and reading

2854
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:52,380
it on the Horde house.

2855
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:53,380
John wrote them all down.

2856
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,380
Oh, did he?

2857
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:55,380
Yeah.

2858
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:56,380
We were going to email you.

2859
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:57,380
Oh, you should.

2860
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:58,380
You should do that.

2861
02:17:58,380 --> 02:17:59,380
They were all from the same server.

2862
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:00,380
All right.

2863
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:01,380
Dick faces.

2864
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:02,380
So, all right.

2865
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:03,380
Uh, there you go.

2866
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:04,540
That's, that's it for the FUs of the week.

2867
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:07,460
Just a few more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at one eight seven

2868
02:18:07,460 --> 02:18:12,240
seven game O L R or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio at us on Skype.

2869
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:14,780
If you haven't already, but we'll get to that in a minute.

2870
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:15,780
First more stories.

2871
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:16,780
Lucky.

2872
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:17,780
Yes.

2873
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:24,100
Uh, this is kind of neat on live is finally coming to the iOS platform as well as Android

2874
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:30,740
and uh, it's really, you can actually use it to, um, play games on your tablet or phone

2875
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:31,740
device.

2876
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:36,660
Um, they also are going to be selling a wireless controller that comes with the free app download

2877
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:42,660
as well for about, I want to say 50 bucks, uh, which also is the same price as the streaming

2878
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,460
console if you really want to.

2879
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:50,180
Um, and it is Bluetooth and allows you the, you know, basically use your tablet as you

2880
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:56,540
know, a screen instead of having to use the on screen touch sensitive buttons and stuff

2881
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:00,100
that they have, which they have that option if you don't want to do that.

2882
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:04,700
Um, and apparently also some of the games that they're, they're actually converting

2883
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:07,660
over to work with the touch controls on these tablets.

2884
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:12,260
Like for example, LA noir was something that rockstar games is actually going back and

2885
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:17,460
um, you know, fixing that up so that you can use, you know, touch controls with the game

2886
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:18,460
as well.

2887
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:24,100
Um, and I want to say there was a kingdoms, uh, was a kingdom of keffi limbs, uh, that

2888
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:27,900
was also going to be getting the kind of the same treatment as well.

2889
02:19:27,900 --> 02:19:32,940
Um, it just looks kind of neat and I guess it works pretty well.

2890
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:36,900
Um, I actually thought about downloading this to try it.

2891
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:40,780
I don't know if I have to actually purchase the app to check it out, but obviously you

2892
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:44,300
need an online subscription and stuff, but it'd be neat to check out.

2893
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:45,300
Not necessarily.

2894
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:50,460
I like, I would not want to play on my iPod though with the screen controls cause I can

2895
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:53,260
imagine my, my hand would cover the whole damn thing.

2896
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:56,200
Um, but it's still kind of neat that they could do this.

2897
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:01,580
You know what would be really cool, I guess, I don't know if that, if it has the power

2898
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:07,100
to do that, but, um, the Apple TV, you know, if you could do an app like that, but you

2899
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:11,280
know, with the rumors around the corner that, you know, Apple is actually creating their

2900
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:16,260
own TV set soon, this very well could be integrated into something like one way to get more Apple

2901
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:17,260
TVs sold.

2902
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:20,780
Like I'm talking about the actual set top boxes, just build it into an actual TV.

2903
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:21,780
Yeah.

2904
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:27,620
So, um, make them in cool colors and everybody will want one that it's an interesting prospect

2905
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:31,340
that, you know, this is gonna, if it worked, I mean, it works pretty good.

2906
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:36,740
Um, of course the only downside is obviously it's not going to work as good as your, you

2907
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:42,780
know, streaming console because, you know, those are normally wired connections versus

2908
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:43,780
this.

2909
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:48,220
You probably want to be on wifi to be able to play the games, you know, full resolution

2910
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:49,580
without any lag.

2911
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:53,220
Um, although from what I was reading, like, you know, games are normally 60 frames per

2912
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:58,660
second, it was 50 frames per second and you know, maybe the resolution's a little lower,

2913
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:02,020
um, than it would normally be, but, um, overall, not too bad.

2914
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:07,660
I actually saw some gameplay footage of someone playing, um, saints row the third on an iPod

2915
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:09,060
or something like that.

2916
02:21:09,060 --> 02:21:10,060
Wow.

2917
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:15,140
So that was kind of cool looking saints row third on the go as tempting.

2918
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:20,740
But uh, um, yeah, I don't know, it's a really neat, neat idea.

2919
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:24,340
So it'd be interesting to see, you know, what games are support right now.

2920
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:29,420
They don't have all of the games obviously supporting this, but, um, they're launching

2921
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:36,840
with about 18 games and, um, you know, I guess they launched originally with 21 games when

2922
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:43,180
the streaming console came out and, um, you know, they're going to be adding more as they,

2923
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:47,940
you know, convert some over and, um, get them to work a little bit better with the portable

2924
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:48,940
systems.

2925
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:49,940
All right.

2926
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,940
Very interesting.

2927
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:53,060
The way this technology is going, I think this could be a pretty huge in the future

2928
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:57,140
because even if it's not on live itself, people are going to see what on live is doing and

2929
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:01,300
think, Hmm, how can we do that for our gaming experience?

2930
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:04,420
It's just a matter of time before developers just cut out on life completely.

2931
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:09,340
I mean, especially on something like I asked why the only thing you need on life for is

2932
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:13,740
their bandwidth and maybe I don't think the technology is particularly proprietary because

2933
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:14,740
there are competitors.

2934
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:18,620
Like there was that whole FIFA streaming to YouTube thing that was not, that was Genkai

2935
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,700
or whatever.

2936
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,500
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

2937
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:24,780
Anyhow, uh, I want to move on to another story.

2938
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:26,940
This had the game world talking this week.

2939
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:32,460
This is huge news this week because a wired had a, uh, interview with Miyamoto and they

2940
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:37,660
ran the headline is the headline quote Nintendo's Miyamoto stepping down, working on smaller

2941
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:41,820
games and everybody took that and literally this around the rest of the internet and intent.

2942
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,380
Uh, Miyamoto is quitting.

2943
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:48,540
Nintendo Miyamoto is retiring because people read into that saying Miyamoto stepping down

2944
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:53,140
and they kind of missed the hidden subtext and, and granted this headline is a little

2945
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:57,900
bit sensationalistic, but that's the way headlines are kind of written to be, um, is that Miyamoto

2946
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:02,580
stepping down from the Mario and Zelda games that he's been working on.

2947
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:08,060
And and of course, Nintendo followed this up with an official quote where Nintendo is

2948
02:23:08,060 --> 02:23:11,460
basically like, no, no, no, Miyamoto is not retiring.

2949
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:15,540
Uh, video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto's role in Nintendo is not changing.

2950
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:19,160
He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts in discussing

2951
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:23,480
his priorities at Nintendo in a media interview, Mr. Miyamoto explained how he is encouraging

2952
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:27,180
the younger developers of the company to take more initiative and responsibility for developing

2953
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,180
software.

2954
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:31,300
And in fact, if you kind of go back to the original interview, here's what the wired

2955
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:36,540
article says, quote, inside our office, I've been recently declaring I'm going to retire.

2956
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,740
I'm going to retire.

2957
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:40,860
I'm not saying that I'm going to retire from game development altogether.

2958
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:44,720
What I mean by retiring is retiring from my current position.

2959
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:48,720
What I really want to do is be in the forefront of game development once again, myself probably

2960
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:53,040
working on a smaller project with even younger developers, or I might be interested in making

2961
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:57,040
something that I can make myself by myself, something really small.

2962
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:01,140
In other words, I'm not intending to start from things that require a five year development

2963
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:03,740
time when all is said and done.

2964
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:06,900
The internet was making this sound out to, uh, out to sound like bad news.

2965
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:09,620
I think this is great news.

2966
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:11,300
I think this is fantastic news.

2967
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:15,820
I don't think Miyamoto should be taking all this time to work on Zelda and Mario games

2968
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:18,580
when the, um, outlines are pretty much all laid out.

2969
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:22,660
I mean, I think he should be there to give creative input and so forth, but, but that's

2970
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:23,660
really it.

2971
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:27,580
I mean, these, these things are in kind of capable hands now, you know, Miyamoto ain't

2972
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:28,960
getting any younger.

2973
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:33,460
He's been making games since the original NES, which just celebrated his 25th anniversary.

2974
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:38,500
So I would like to see before he really does have to retire, I mean, all good things must

2975
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:44,180
come to an end folks, someday Miyamoto is going to die.

2976
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:46,340
So I hope it's not for a long time.

2977
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:51,700
I'm not saying anything rude, you know, I'm just saying inevitably someday orange launch

2978
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:53,900
radio will end.

2979
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,780
It has to end at some point.

2980
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:59,140
I'm not saying it's going to end next week and we're going to try to go as long as we

2981
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:00,660
possibly can.

2982
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:04,320
Someday grandma will grab Pogo to die.

2983
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:08,020
But my point is, you know, maybe Miyamoto is like, do I really want to spend the rest

2984
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:12,100
of my years in Nintendo working on another Zelda game?

2985
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:14,700
You know, no, let's, let's, let's somebody else kind of do what they want with Zelda

2986
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:18,900
and I want to try something new or I want to go back to the way we used to do it and

2987
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:23,260
I'm going to try to do a game on myself because remember a lot of those Atari 2600 games back

2988
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:25,940
in the day were programmed by like one guy.

2989
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:30,980
So I would like, I think Miyamoto should spill out more of the contents of his brain for

2990
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:31,980
us to consume.

2991
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:32,980
You know what?

2992
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:39,620
I'm stuck, but what if in that brain of his is the next Mario or the next Zelda?

2993
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:42,420
I mean, aren't you all complaining at the same token?

2994
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:45,500
I'm kind of sick of Nintendo putting out the same shit over and over again.

2995
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:48,060
Then let Miyamoto develop something else.

2996
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:52,160
This is fantastic news.

2997
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:54,860
You get limited when you're stuck with the same thing over and over again.

2998
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:57,540
It's the same reason why actors don't want to be typecast.

2999
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:59,420
Don't you think?

3000
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:00,420
Yes.

3001
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:01,420
Same thing.

3002
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:04,580
And of course now the chat room is running with this act deft.

3003
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:05,940
Miyamoto will never die.

3004
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:07,700
Don't say such cruel things, Rob.

3005
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:08,700
Alpha-canonogram.

3006
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:09,700
Miyamoto, die.

3007
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:10,700
Kill the non-believer.

3008
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:12,100
Well, I will say this.

3009
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:13,100
I will say this.

3010
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:15,740
This is a high compliment.

3011
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:20,040
When the inevitable happens and Miyamoto passes away, think of it this way.

3012
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:26,080
The work that he's created in some ways kind of defines this generation.

3013
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:28,740
It defines a part of our culture.

3014
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:34,140
And some of us could only be so lucky to have really made that kind of impact on the world.

3015
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:37,600
I mean, Miyamoto made an impact on the world.

3016
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:42,580
So in that sense, Miyamoto is immortal in that sense.

3017
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:45,140
You want to take this to a weird deeper level.

3018
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:50,020
In some ways, what we've done here at Orange Lounge Radio has had an impact and that makes

3019
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:52,260
me feel really good about what we do every week.

3020
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:53,260
Not nearly the impact.

3021
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:57,880
I wouldn't say we've been a cultural revolution, but if you're tuning into this program and

3022
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:00,940
spending your night with us, then we've had a little impact.

3023
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:02,900
We've had a little impact.

3024
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:06,380
So that's pretty cool.

3025
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:07,380
Right Darsakra?

3026
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:09,380
You haven't been listening to me at all, have you?

3027
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:13,460
Yeah, no, I was, but I actually just had a Brush with Celebrity moment.

3028
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:14,460
Oh?

3029
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:18,360
One of my favorite people ever who's been on a reality show.

3030
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:21,580
And I'm not a big reality show person, but I love MasterChef.

3031
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:28,740
Ben Star, the guy who has fourth place on the season before last, just said that he

3032
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,900
thought that my dish sounded delicious.

3033
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:35,760
I asked him for advice when cooking a butternut squash.

3034
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,700
Just because I was like, I'll ask a pro, why not?

3035
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:42,540
And he seems to reply to people, but he gave me his method, but he gave it to me 20 hours

3036
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:43,540
late.

3037
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:44,980
So he's like, so what did you end up doing with it?

3038
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:49,480
And I said, oh, I cooked it and it was still firm, so I saved it to microwave.

3039
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:53,560
And I said, I mixed this, that, and the other, and he said, that sounds really yummy.

3040
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:56,720
So I was like, I got a compliment.

3041
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:59,920
It's always a little bit fun when a quote unquote celebrity, no matter if it's A-list

3042
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:01,700
or F-list, kind of interacts with you on Twitter.

3043
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:02,700
That's why Twitter is so popular.

3044
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:04,340
Well, no, not on Twitter, on Facebook.

3045
02:28:04,340 --> 02:28:06,380
Well, still, same idea.

3046
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:10,780
But he's actually one of the people that I learned the most from watching that show on

3047
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:13,700
cooking dishes, because he's traveled and been to places.

3048
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:15,140
Okay, let me put it this way.

3049
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:18,660
When I followed George Takei on Twitter, he sent me a direct message.

3050
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,380
You know, it's like, thanks for following me and all that stuff.

3051
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:21,380
Like I know he didn't write it.

3052
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:23,440
I know he's got people that, you know, probably do that stuff.

3053
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:24,700
He's not sitting there at his computer all day.

3054
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:27,360
He's got better things to do.

3055
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:30,020
And probably a lot of that stuff he posts to Facebook too.

3056
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:33,320
Like some of it might get his approval, but he probably has a whole team of people that

3057
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:34,320
maintain his public image.

3058
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:37,500
And I'll tell you this, they do a damn fucking good job.

3059
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:41,920
George Takei's people team is probably some of the finest in the industry, if you think

3060
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:42,920
about it.

3061
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:45,540
I mean, like George Takei's stuff is all over Facebook.

3062
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:48,020
His tweets get retweeted all the time.

3063
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:53,220
He's like, he's even more legendary than Betty White in social media, dare I say it.

3064
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:56,340
Which brings me back to the idea of, didn't we have a sitcom idea this week where it was

3065
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:58,900
like George Takei and Julie Andrews raising you?

3066
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:04,180
Yeah, no, I said, I said that I, that I wish that I, I love my family, but I wish that

3067
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:08,340
I had been adopted by George Takei and Julie Andrews or, you know, if they were really

3068
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:13,980
my parents and I would be half Japanese with an amazing singing voice, you know, and probably

3069
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:14,980
raging lesbian.

3070
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:16,980
All right, let's move on.

3071
02:29:16,980 --> 02:29:18,340
Just a few more news stories for you guys.

3072
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:19,340
Dark Sakura.

3073
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:20,340
Oh yeah.

3074
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,340
I do have another story, don't I?

3075
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,340
Yes, you do.

3076
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:25,580
How about a little bit of technical comparison?

3077
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:33,040
Batman, Arkham City, the PC versions and the console versions, they're actually saying

3078
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:40,980
that they really, really wanted to bump it up and make it look really good.

3079
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:46,960
They had it set to run for DirectX 11 so that it was as clean and perfect as it could even

3080
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:50,620
though for the smoother gameplay, they said, keep it to nine as it would be comparable

3081
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,420
with the consoles.

3082
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:58,820
But they apparently just had it to look amazing for the PC players that had the best systems.

3083
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:02,300
So I was looking at some of the comparisons on here.

3084
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:04,500
And Arkham City's already a gorgeous game.

3085
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:05,500
Good lord.

3086
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:06,500
Yeah.

3087
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:11,380
Well that, that at least makes the delay between versions a little more worth the wait if they've

3088
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:13,220
managed to tweak it to look even better.

3089
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:16,900
I mean, granted, you probably need the highest of high end systems to be able to really see,

3090
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:18,780
but it's still pretty cool.

3091
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:23,940
But see, they're showing it versus the PS3 and the PC, some of the difference in the

3092
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:27,620
shading effect and the textures.

3093
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:36,380
It actually, and I have to say, cause we have the PS3 one here, as clean as it was, I mean,

3094
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:43,740
it's really hard to compare a console with a PC when the PCs are consistently upgradable.

3095
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:52,780
You can get the best stuff for it, but as beautiful as the textures and the lighting

3096
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:58,620
and everything in the PC one was, it actually really makes me appreciate the PS3 version

3097
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:05,120
because it really is pretty close, even though, I mean, yeah, tech spec wise, the PC one will

3098
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:11,600
blow it out of the water, but the PS3 version really keeps up.

3099
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:12,600
It's a gorgeous game.

3100
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:13,600
Absolutely gorgeous game.

3101
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:14,600
Yours is best.

3102
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:18,900
But there are also some other improvements too, just in the PC one, other than the higher

3103
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:26,180
resolution textures, they actually, it's all the stuff that you see up close, like pores

3104
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:27,500
and indentations under the skin.

3105
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,500
You can see veins.

3106
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:34,300
I mean, they really put a lot of effort into making it look realistic.

3107
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:35,300
I want to go back to chat.

3108
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:39,220
The chat room's a little bit delayed, but there was a great quote here from chat on

3109
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:40,220
the Miyamoto thing.

3110
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:43,540
I want to read this real quick here from Midori in our chat room at chat.orangesonshreddy.com.

3111
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:45,580
I love your drinks.

3112
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:51,020
He, meaning Miyamoto, will be immortal, but I understand that if I had the choice, I'd

3113
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:55,820
want to be known for making the most favored characters over how many games I could develop

3114
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:58,180
for a few loved characters.

3115
02:31:58,180 --> 02:31:59,540
That's a really good way to sum it up.

3116
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:02,660
So I just wanted to throw that out there because that mirrors my thoughts very closely.

3117
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:06,220
All right, just a couple of quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line is going

3118
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:07,220
to open up.

3119
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:08,220
So, Loki.

3120
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,260
All right.

3121
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,640
So this is neat, I guess.

3122
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:20,060
They're going to be giving a little bit of bonuses for fans of Final Fantasy XIII-2 or

3123
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:21,460
even the original Final Fantasy game.

3124
02:32:21,460 --> 02:32:25,100
If you play the original Final Fantasy XIII game and you have a game save, you're going

3125
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:30,300
to be getting some special features, including special monster decorations and a higher success

3126
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:31,300
rate at the games.

3127
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:32,820
I guess they have a gambling area.

3128
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:37,980
I wonder if it's anything like, what was that in Final Fantasy VII, like the golden something

3129
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,980
or other.

3130
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,980
I can't remember what it was called.

3131
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:44,180
Time of lucky hit.

3132
02:32:44,180 --> 02:32:47,700
Also I guess they're saying that the game's going to be broken up in the episodes and

3133
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:50,300
each episode will be about three hours long.

3134
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:54,580
Also going to be adding an auto save system as well as the ability to save in different

3135
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:55,900
places.

3136
02:32:55,900 --> 02:33:01,740
Plus there's going to be a new game plus mode that adds, I guess, unlockable items and also

3137
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:05,340
new monster decorations as well.

3138
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:09,900
And neat, I mean that extra stuff is good.

3139
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:13,540
I know that they're going to be doing some DLC though for it and I think that's kind

3140
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:16,460
of ridiculous as far as what they're adding with the DLC.

3141
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:21,260
I think more monster decorations, but remember it's optional, you don't need to buy it.

3142
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:28,340
Well that's good as long as it's extra frilly stuff and not necessary to the game's completion.

3143
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:30,060
But the game's sounding better and better, I can't wait to play it.

3144
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:33,740
I really need to actually finish the last chapter of Final Fantasy XIII.

3145
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:38,100
I was digging through my bag the other day and I saw Final Fantasy XIII there, I'm like

3146
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:41,140
oh yeah, I need to finish that.

3147
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:44,140
By the way, chat room to the rescue on the gambling thing of Final Fantasy VII, Gold

3148
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,140
Saucer.

3149
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:47,380
Yeah, it is Gold Saucer.

3150
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:51,420
Alright, and one more Final Fantasy related story for you guys this week and it has to

3151
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:53,940
do with Final Fantasy XIV.

3152
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:54,940
Guess what?

3153
02:33:54,940 --> 02:34:00,940
They are going to charge service fees for Final Fantasy XIV.

3154
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:02,940
I'm not playing.

3155
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:06,020
Final Fantasy XIV, here's the deal.

3156
02:34:06,020 --> 02:34:09,780
They will be implementing the fee change on January 6th.

3157
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:14,660
This has been pushed back a little bit, it was supposed to start by now essentially.

3158
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:18,960
So on January 6th they are going to start the new pricing structure.

3159
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:23,660
So what will happen is that the subscription fees, this is weird, the basic service is

3160
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:32,500
$6.99 for 30 days and then the real subscription fee when the new version starts will be $9.99

3161
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:34,020
for 30 days.

3162
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:37,140
That's kind of weird the way that's set up, but there you go.

3163
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:41,060
And if you want extra characters, that's the other weird thing, it's $3 a character.

3164
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:45,740
So it's definitely cheaper than $14.95 but still, I mean that monthly fee, it's going

3165
02:34:45,740 --> 02:34:47,940
to be very interesting to see the impact that has on the game.

3166
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:49,500
I think it's going to kill it.

3167
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:52,900
I think it has those diehard fans that still support it but now that they're going to ask

3168
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:55,800
money out of pocket every month, that's going to be rough.

3169
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:57,300
I know I won't pay for it.

3170
02:34:57,300 --> 02:35:02,700
I'll go back and check it out when version 2 launches or if there's some huge content

3171
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:06,220
upgrade but yeah, I think Zethur summed it up in chat.

3172
02:35:06,220 --> 02:35:08,940
Well, there it goes Final Fantasy XIV.

3173
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:10,740
Bye bye.

3174
02:35:10,740 --> 02:35:13,300
Nice knowing you.

3175
02:35:13,300 --> 02:35:19,060
Let's go to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3176
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:22,260
I'm going to check the Twitter too to see if we have any tweets.

3177
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:25,660
I forgot to ask for those earlier because I was so involved in the Mario Kart thing

3178
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:31,060
earlier but I'll look for those if I can find them amongst the new Twitter because they've

3179
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:34,020
changed the look of Twitter again.

3180
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,220
Why?

3181
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:36,220
Because they can.

3182
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:38,220
Although I will say it's not terrible.

3183
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:42,420
Alright, let's go to the Skype line.

3184
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:45,860
Meanwhile while we wait for the Skype line, Loki, do we have last minute stories?

3185
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,580
I'm sure there's got to be a few tonight because I think there were some big things I skipped

3186
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:49,580
over, right?

3187
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:50,580
Umm, maybe.

3188
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:58,020
I didn't look them up so I'm trying to think here if there's anything really major that

3189
02:35:58,020 --> 02:35:59,540
I can think of off the top of my head.

3190
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:01,380
Well, I have a couple tweets while you're looking alright.

3191
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:02,380
Alright, sounds good.

3192
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:09,660
Mishiro Chan, Mishiro Chan or Gamer Girl says, I just picked up the Oregon Trail game for

3193
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:11,540
the Wii and it's pretty fun.

3194
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:14,260
I'm working on doing a write up to post on site.

3195
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:15,260
Awesome.

3196
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:16,260
I would like to hear more about it.

3197
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:18,320
I hope it's better than the Facebook one, that's for sure.

3198
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:22,800
I think it looks, well, I think it looks very similar to the Facebook and the phone version

3199
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,800
that they add out.

3200
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:28,100
In fact, I would be surprised if it wasn't the exact same.

3201
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:30,420
I hope it will not die of dysentery.

3202
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:35,460
Umm, YYR tweets us saying, remember, boom!

3203
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:36,700
And sends us a YouTube link.

3204
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:41,460
Usually I don't play YouTube links on the show but I'm hoping that it's a link from

3205
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:44,620
umm, uhh, Bungee Ferret Cat.

3206
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:47,820
Oh no, this is from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

3207
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:48,820
Cliff.

3208
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:49,820
Amprecias.

3209
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:52,580
Oh, I love these.

3210
02:36:52,580 --> 02:36:56,300
Mysterious Sepro lecture number three.

3211
02:36:56,300 --> 02:37:00,580
I've just mastered the skill known as the pulverizing bash.

3212
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:02,080
Indeed.

3213
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:07,980
By running to increase your speed, the power to throw yourselves increases as well.

3214
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:13,220
You can destroy places with weak foundations or small cracks with incredible ease.

3215
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:20,180
But, be sure to give yourself plenty of room to run so you can increase your speed.

3216
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:21,180
That's right.

3217
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:24,260
Make a good approach, start running and then boom!

3218
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:27,380
That's all for today.

3219
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:28,380
Yeah.

3220
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:29,380
Let's go to the phones.

3221
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:30,380
I love the voice acting in that game.

3222
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:31,380
And then boom!

3223
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,380
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3224
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:33,380
Who's this?

3225
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:34,380
Hey, it's Zether from the chat.

3226
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:35,380
Hi.

3227
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:36,380
Zether from the chat.

3228
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:37,380
What's on your mind?

3229
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:38,380
Oh, not much.

3230
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:42,460
I enjoyed playing Mario Kart with you guys, it was pretty fun.

3231
02:37:42,460 --> 02:37:44,780
I know, Mario Kart's an awesome game.

3232
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,780
Yeah.

3233
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:52,380
Umm, well yesterday I recently beat umm, well yesterday I beat umm, Snatcher yesterday.

3234
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:53,380
It was really fun.

3235
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:54,380
Freakin' love Snatcher.

3236
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,380
Gosh, that's old school.

3237
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:57,380
Nice.

3238
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:02,380
Yeah, it's, I, I didn't think I would be able to finish it, like to finish all of it, but

3239
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:07,060
I finished like the second, by the time you finish the second act, the game pretty much

3240
02:38:07,060 --> 02:38:13,140
becomes like, pretty much just goes automatically for you, but there is this one final shooting

3241
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:17,100
segment that's actually very difficult.

3242
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:24,140
It was the umm, the super Insector things, and they start like swarming around the screen.

3243
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:29,000
And then umm, I kept dying repeatedly at that part, and then umm, it came up to the, then

3244
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,420
I didn't realize that there was a second part where you had to shoot Snatchers, and I died

3245
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:38,560
during that, and it kicks you back to the first part again with the Insectors, so it's

3246
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:42,880
a little annoying having to keep doing it over and over.

3247
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:45,480
But I beat it, it was pretty good.

3248
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:48,360
It's always a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a game.

3249
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:52,620
It's one I haven't felt in a long time because I have such gamer ADD I never finish anything.

3250
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:58,620
Yeah, I, I actually did finish umm, Saints Row the Third a couple, like a month ago I

3251
02:38:58,620 --> 02:38:59,620
think.

3252
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:01,300
Now what'd you think of Saints Row the Third?

3253
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:03,920
Cuz I just played it for the first time this week.

3254
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:05,660
I think it was really good.

3255
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:12,240
It was pretty over the top, insane, definitely, I, I preordered it on Steam, full price, and

3256
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:14,440
I, I definitely got what I paid for.

3257
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:15,880
It was really good.

3258
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:16,880
Nice.

3259
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:20,640
It's, I love, I love how over the top it is, what kind, did you make, did you try to make

3260
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:24,840
a character who was kinda like you, or did you make a character who was over the top

3261
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:25,840
too?

3262
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:31,120
I actually downloaded a character from the umm, from like the online thing.

3263
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:35,640
They had a guy who looked like Gabe Newell, so I used him for the whole game.

3264
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:36,640
Nice.

3265
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:41,280
And it was hilarious just seeing this guy running, who looks like Gabe Newell running

3266
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,440
around like being all snarky and blowing stuff up.

3267
02:39:45,440 --> 02:39:53,320
It's like, oh, oh wow, Gabe Newell's blowing up a helicopter, now he's killing these furries

3268
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:55,320
in this umm, game show.

3269
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:58,240
That sounds like something Gabe Newell might actually do.

3270
02:39:58,240 --> 02:39:59,760
Yeah.

3271
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:00,760
It was pretty good.

3272
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:01,760
Awesome.

3273
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:04,280
Well it sounds like I've barely scratched the surface of the game.

3274
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:05,280
Furries on a game show?

3275
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,920
I haven't come across this yet, so it sounds pretty awesome.

3276
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:11,080
Yeah, it's the umm, it's one of the side missions you play in umm, Genki's little

3277
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:13,760
ridiculous game show thing.

3278
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:18,440
I keep doing the missions like one after another, should I just say screw it and kind of drive

3279
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:19,440
around and look for stuff first?

3280
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:24,320
No, because they're gonna take you through those, all the like uhh, diversions basically

3281
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:28,600
by actually playing the missions because they kind of, it goes through the whole tutorial

3282
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:32,280
mode a little long, but it's good because you've never played any of the games, so you

3283
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:35,920
know, you don't know how to play insurance fraud or anything like that.

3284
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:36,920
Right, right.

3285
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:42,360
So umm, but they'll take you through like the Genki show and Tiger Escort and stuff

3286
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:43,360
like that.

3287
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:44,360
Oh yeah, that one's good.

3288
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:45,360
I can only imagine.

3289
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:46,640
The tank one is the best.

3290
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:51,400
I think the tank one where you have to rack up the most umm, money and damage is the best

3291
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:56,840
because you can literally just go through, just keep pressing forward, holding down both,

3292
02:40:56,840 --> 02:41:01,720
holding down both fire buttons for the minigun and the main cannon, you can pretty much just

3293
02:41:01,720 --> 02:41:03,320
keep racking up the points.

3294
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:04,320
It's all about the fences.

3295
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:09,160
No, my, my favorite thing so far has been the little computer that my chick picked up

3296
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:13,080
and she can use it to just fire guided missiles at tanks on a whim.

3297
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:19,760
Oh yeah, that's awesome, the umm, it's kind of like a umm, missile launch, yeah the missile

3298
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:20,760
drop thing.

3299
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:23,040
Yeah, it's like a little computer you use to launch missiles and I guess it's like a

3300
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:27,160
regular weapon you can use to just launch guided missiles at your foes.

3301
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:28,960
That's pretty impressive.

3302
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:32,880
And I gotta say the environments, like I love the whole like downtown LA looking environment

3303
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:37,760
is, it's very neon and I love purple so I'm glad it's the ganks color.

3304
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:41,640
Just wait until you get to the Tron world, the Tron world is amazing.

3305
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:44,800
I'm sure I'll have a huge boner over to the Tron world because I love Tron.

3306
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:48,920
Yeah, it's pretty awesome, I was enjoying like every minute of it.

3307
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:49,920
Awesome, awesome.

3308
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:54,200
Alright well Zethyr, any other final thoughts to get out there before we let you go?

3309
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:58,920
Not much, I finished Snatcher and I'm actually playing the MSX version like the, because

3310
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:00,160
somebody translated it.

3311
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,160
Old school Snatcher.

3312
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:06,600
Yeah, even older than the Sega CD one so, and then I'm probably gonna go play Policenauts

3313
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:12,080
which is the follow up of sorts and it got translated to you.

3314
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,440
I have Policenauts on Playstation.

3315
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:15,440
Check out the original Metal Gear.

3316
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:18,000
Yeah, it's the one that got translated actually.

3317
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,800
And the real Metal Gear 2 that's on MSX.

3318
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:24,000
Well no, I mean I've got it in Japanese and it was a pain in the butt trying to play through

3319
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,000
it in Japanese.

3320
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Oh yeah it is.

3321
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Yeah.

3322
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Lots of text.

3323
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,600
Alright well Zethyr, enjoy your Kojima-thon, okay?

3324
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:31,600
Alright.

3325
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:32,600
Alright, later.

3326
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:33,600
Later.

3327
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:38,720
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, AkumaJP in chat says, human rights for furries

3328
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,720
too.

3329
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:42,960
Well you know what, if I'm not mistaken, you could make your character a furry and you

3330
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:44,880
could just revenge of the furries.

3331
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:48,800
So if you want to blow everything up as a furry, you have every right to do so and you

3332
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:53,520
could lead this notorious gang of criminals if you want that everybody stops and asks

3333
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:54,920
for the autograph.

3334
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:58,600
So like, I just remember in the very beginning of the game, some girl asked for some guy's

3335
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:01,680
autograph and then I walked up and she didn't want my autograph so I shot her.

3336
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:05,800
I was like, how rude, bang.

3337
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:08,240
Game makes me sound like a terrible person but it's really fun.

3338
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:11,600
That's because you are a terrible person, heart.

3339
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,600
Hey!

3340
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:14,000
I'll shoot you too.

3341
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,160
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

3342
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:18,160
Alright.

3343
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:21,160
More last minute stories-ish things going on over there.

3344
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:25,760
Yeah they announced that the VGAs that they're doing, Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, it's gonna

3345
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:30,960
blend I guess the first two Tony Hawk titles and be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and

3346
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,120
PlayStation Network next year.

3347
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:35,520
Gosh, the recent Tony Hawk games haven't been selling.

3348
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:36,960
How can we get the game to sell again?

3349
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:39,720
I know, let's go back to when the games did sell.

3350
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:42,880
You know what, that's not a bad idea and it looked pretty good based on the trailer.

3351
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:47,000
I liked Pro Skater, I thought that was pretty awesome so I would look forward to playing

3352
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
this actually.

3353
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Alright, let's go to another call.

3354
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3355
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
It's Legend of Zaku here.

3356
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Zaku, what's up?

3357
02:43:54,000 --> 02:44:00,040
Nothing much, just kicking back, making sure I stay calm and sane before tomorrow's work

3358
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:01,040
week.

3359
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:02,040
Well good luck.

3360
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:06,040
But yeah, it's been a while since I called, so I got through actually.

3361
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:07,040
It's been a little while.

3362
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,040
What have you been playing?

3363
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,040
What's new?

3364
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:15,480
Let's see, Forza 4 having to tackle the wireless steering wheel that Microsoft released for

3365
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:18,000
the 360.

3366
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:25,880
But all in all it's been mostly that and just playing my PC, but nothing new on that end.

3367
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:27,840
Do you use head tracking in Forza 4 at all?

3368
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:28,840
Do you have Kinect?

3369
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:29,840
I don't have a Kinect.

3370
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:31,480
I don't have enough space in my room for a Kinect.

3371
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:35,740
You could get one of those little Zoom things, but I kind of bought one and it kind of sucks

3372
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:36,740
for me.

3373
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:37,740
I didn't like it.

3374
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:40,400
It's smaller than the dorm rooms I was in in college.

3375
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:42,320
Well, you do live in New York City.

3376
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:45,160
Yeah, but it's a house.

3377
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:52,640
Anyways, I noticed yesterday, I know it's almost like gaming related, but one of the

3378
02:44:52,640 --> 02:45:01,160
best DDR freestylers in the country, you know, frequency, I know him in real life.

3379
02:45:01,160 --> 02:45:05,520
He had his little going away party yesterday and pretty much all the old school DDR players

3380
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:06,520
came out.

3381
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:07,520
Where's he going to?

3382
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:11,160
Moving back to Long Island.

3383
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:14,760
So yeah, that was pretty much me just getting drunk.

3384
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:20,800
I think I should have gotten a DDR dollar bill into the mix, but I didn't even notify

3385
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:21,800
him.

3386
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:22,800
Oh.

3387
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:26,120
How rude of us.

3388
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:30,160
But anyways, shifting on real quick.

3389
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:35,920
Video game awards were yesterday and I noticed that Battlefield 3 got shafted.

3390
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:40,320
It came empty handed.

3391
02:45:40,320 --> 02:45:44,880
The way I see it is that the winners were pretty much like, I know they're picked by

3392
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:50,760
the people, but boy do they have like, aside from Skyrim and Uncharted and Arkham actually

3393
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:57,240
getting the words they deserve, they actually had the gall to put Modern Warfare 3, you

3394
02:45:57,240 --> 02:46:00,760
know, put them up on the pedestal for anything.

3395
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:04,840
It's well, without getting into the whole Modern Warfare versus Battlefield thing, because

3396
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:08,960
honestly I have no authority whatsoever to speak on that subject.

3397
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:14,500
But just in general, it's a tough year for game awards and all that because there's so

3398
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:15,880
much good shit this year.

3399
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:18,080
It has really been a great year for games.

3400
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:19,080
As it should be.

3401
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:21,280
I mean, the systems have been out how long?

3402
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:24,160
This is the years where they're really perfecting these systems.

3403
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:27,840
I expect that next year should kick a lot of ass, too.

3404
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:29,840
I mean, yeah, you're right.

3405
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:32,880
Mass Effect 3 is like, what, a month away from now?

3406
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:33,880
That's right.

3407
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:35,800
Yeah, those games aren't afraid to release in January.

3408
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:37,840
Yeah, of course.

3409
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:42,480
They have very little competition for movies since that's a dumping ground for those films

3410
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:43,480
anyways.

3411
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:47,400
Yeah, it's a smart time to release a game.

3412
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:53,800
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yeah, this was a pretty good year for video gaming,

3413
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:54,800
you know, in recent memory.

3414
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:57,240
Oh yeah, pretty much so.

3415
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:04,080
And hopefully next year, whatever they release, whatever they come out with, at that point

3416
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:08,520
they're gonna start, you know, I'm more concerned about Nintendo.

3417
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:12,640
Like they better start pulling rabbits out of their hat to replace their aging Wii.

3418
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:14,480
Well, Wii U next year.

3419
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:15,480
And now it's...

3420
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:20,600
Yeah, if they can pull it off, if the rumors aren't true that their dev units are even,

3421
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:22,760
are just like, not even up to par yet.

3422
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:27,840
Well, keep in mind too, 3DS, thanks to the two strong releases, has gained a lot of steam,

3423
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,320
which you know, I think we all saw coming.

3424
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:33,760
Like you know, we knew they had to pull it out this holiday season and I think they've

3425
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,480
succeeded to an extent with the two big releases.

3426
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:40,960
I don't know what the final word is on how much it's sold, but I think they're saying

3427
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:43,640
already it sold more than the DS did in its first year.

3428
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:49,280
Now granted, it's a little bit apple to oranges because, you know, the 3DS should have the

3429
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:56,360
DS's inertia to piggyback on, but you know, I think all in all, the 3DS is not going away

3430
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:57,680
anytime soon.

3431
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:03,220
Right, and then obviously it still has to contend with the Vita and then all the new

3432
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:05,840
powerful smartphones are coming out within the next year.

3433
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:08,760
I kind of think there's room for both the 3DS and the Vita.

3434
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:12,240
I don't think they're going to bite from each other that much.

3435
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:16,540
What about the third one, the mobile game market?

3436
02:48:16,540 --> 02:48:20,600
The fact that the smartphones out there are pretty much not only matching, but exceeding

3437
02:48:20,600 --> 02:48:24,120
their specs.

3438
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:33,600
I have yet to play a game on a cell phone that also exists on a 3DS or Vita or any handheld

3439
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:35,440
system that outshines it.

3440
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:41,680
I wonder if Angry Birds would count since they already have it on PSP.

3441
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,400
I'm not big on Angry Birds.

3442
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:46,760
It's not to say mobile phone games are bad because there's a lot of good ones out there,

3443
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:51,560
but most mobile phone games are kind of developed for mobile phones and they kind of, like,

3444
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:57,040
the handheld game and mobile phones are kind of two separate worlds for me, but I get how

3445
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:59,440
the two can cannibalize from each other as well.

3446
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:03,320
I get how mobile phone is kicking Nintendo in the pants a little bit.

3447
02:49:03,320 --> 02:49:05,600
Why do you think they're...

3448
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:10,440
Because Angry Birds is 99 cents and Mario Kart's 40.

3449
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:15,120
I mean, alright, on one hand you have a system that's basically, you're right, it's touch

3450
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:16,120
screen.

3451
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:22,240
It's the best thing for hardcore gamers, but at the end of the day, they have, you know,

3452
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:27,440
the platforms that they're running on, not only iPhone and Android, they're just, like,

3453
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:31,000
they're getting out these systems for about the same price, but it's something that you're

3454
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:35,420
going to carry with every day and going to use in an emergency, in addition to just playing

3455
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:38,680
Angry Birds or any other, you know, game right now.

3456
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:44,840
Like, even me, for example, I bought, like, SimCity for 10 cents today from the Android

3457
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:48,320
market when they had that little sale, and I actually, I'm kicking myself because I missed

3458
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:52,000
out on Minecraft earlier last week.

3459
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,680
Mirror's Edge was free on iOS this weekend, by the way.

3460
02:49:54,680 --> 02:50:00,480
I don't know if it still is, I grabbed it when it was, so yay me.

3461
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:04,720
But it's like, there are certain games I would play on the Android market, it's just a matter

3462
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:13,000
of like, the ones that I'm willing to shell out money for, and those are pretty much like,

3463
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,000
they're rare.

3464
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:18,120
Like, from Angry Birds and Tap Tap, it's like, if they had something like SimCity or maybe

3465
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:26,000
like a strategy game where you move around units, not like a castle defense game, but

3466
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:31,680
something where you're just like, like a Starcraft or a Command and Conquer clone, then I could

3467
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:34,000
definitely see myself playing that on the subways.

3468
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
All right.

3469
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,920
All right, well, Zaku, I gotta wrap up, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your

3470
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:39,920
call.

3471
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:40,920
Yeah, definitely.

3472
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:41,920
All right, take care, buddy.

3473
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:42,920
Have a good night.

3474
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:43,920
You too.

3475
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:47,400
I'm gonna do it for the phone lines tonight, because we're well after midnight on the East

3476
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:50,320
Coast now, so I think we need to wrap up the show, so sorry to those who didn't get through,

3477
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:54,800
but please consider sending us an email, make DarkSakura work for next week.

3478
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:57,560
Hey, I work really hard all the time.

3479
02:50:57,560 --> 02:51:02,960
One eight, it's, excuse me, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com.

3480
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:07,040
Quickly with these last few tweets, and then Loki left the room for a minute, but we'll

3481
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:11,920
get him to do the last few last minute stories.

3482
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:17,560
Tigerclaw wanted to send us a link that talks about layoffs at THQ's uDraw division.

3483
02:51:17,560 --> 02:51:20,440
Yep, it looks like some layoffs have happened over there.

3484
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:25,440
30 employees were laid off on Friday, and layoffs are never good news, but at the same

3485
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:29,120
time, it sounds like they might have put too many eggs in the basket of uDraw, because

3486
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:33,560
I think it was, like, doing really well at first, but it's really funny.

3487
02:51:33,560 --> 02:51:35,320
I went to a family event today.

3488
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:41,240
My grandma's 95th birthday was today, so happy birthday to my grandma, of course, but some

3489
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:45,400
of my family was there, including, like, you know, some people that don't play a lot of

3490
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:48,600
games, but like families, you know, they're like, they don't really watch a lot of TV,

3491
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:52,600
but they're like, yeah, we own a Wii, and they actually mentioned, she actually said,

3492
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:58,240
oh, we just bought last Christmas this uDraw tablet, but we never play it, so it's kind

3493
02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:02,720
of one of those, you know, oops, the inertia wasn't strong enough to keep the uDraw thing

3494
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:08,400
going, so, ouch, yep, so there it went, goodbye.

3495
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:15,520
And from Rama tweets us, on the hooves of the popular cartoon, we have My Little Pony

3496
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:16,880
Fighting is Magic.

3497
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:21,200
I don't know how I feel about your My Little Pony obsession these days, but sure enough,

3498
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:27,200
at main6.com, they have this little trailer for My Little Pony Fighting Game.

3499
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:36,040
You know what, I used to watch the original My Little Pony.

3500
02:52:36,040 --> 02:52:38,440
These new ones just look derpy.

3501
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:41,080
Well, they do have a character named Derpy, actually.

3502
02:52:41,080 --> 02:52:43,720
Yeah, but I mean, everyone looks derpy.

3503
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:48,960
All right, one more tweet, I'm gonna sneak in one more tweet here from Ziba.

3504
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:54,000
I like Ziba, and she's psychic, because she knew from my teaser tweets, she knew about

3505
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,960
the whole Umlaut thing, she guessed it.

3506
02:52:55,960 --> 02:53:00,200
Ziba says, O-L-R, I recently downloaded Snoopy Street Fair on the App Store.

3507
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:01,200
It's really fun.

3508
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,560
If you are a Snoopy or Peanuts fan, get it.

3509
02:53:03,560 --> 02:53:04,560
I like Snoopy.

3510
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:08,440
I wonder if it's like an action-y game or a puzzle game, I'll have to find out more

3511
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:09,880
about it.

3512
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:12,800
So there you go, that's gonna do it for tweets tonight, let's see if there's any other last

3513
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:13,800
minute stories.

3514
02:53:13,800 --> 02:53:14,800
Loki?

3515
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:20,400
Uh, yeah, there's actually one thing here, well, a couple things.

3516
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:26,880
First off, Q Entertainment has revealed 99 Nights Online.

3517
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:33,760
So if you want a game that's kind of like, it's not exactly like 99 Nights, the regular

3518
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:43,080
one that's sort of like a Dynasty Warriors knockoff almost, but this is a 2D action MMO.

3519
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:46,300
It's interesting that this game refuses to go anywhere, yet we have such a hard time

3520
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:48,240
getting Xenoblade over here, just saying.

3521
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:54,000
It looks very much like, I don't know, like a lot of the 2D games that come over from

3522
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,520
like Vanillaware and stuff like that, Neat, I guess, I don't know if that's actually coming

3523
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:04,460
out over here though, I think that's only in Japan, but pretty cool.

3524
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:15,960
And then, I mean, this is just annoying, but apparently there's been a quote from Capcom,

3525
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:22,760
Christian Svensson, who is the Vice President of Strategic Planning and Marketing Development,

3526
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:32,320
of course, commenting on Mega Man Legends 3, saying that, you know, what was the actual

3527
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:41,560
quote here, that Mega Man is still a key brand for them, and that, you know, I guess basically

3528
02:54:41,560 --> 02:54:50,640
promising that there are fans that, no, there will be a Mega Man game possibly coming out.

3529
02:54:50,640 --> 02:54:54,240
They're considering Mega Man's future, so...

3530
02:54:54,240 --> 02:55:00,520
How nice of you to give it some thought, to take pittance on us commoners, to allow us

3531
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:02,480
an audience with the king.

3532
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:06,360
We're considering it, even though there's this big fan campaign to get another game,

3533
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:09,880
we're considering, you know, being nice and giving you...

3534
02:55:09,880 --> 02:55:12,920
How bad do you want it, boys?

3535
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:19,560
Seriously, and with that, as much as Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome, I can't support

3536
02:55:19,560 --> 02:55:23,800
that kind of thing, so I don't know if I'd buy it.

3537
02:55:23,800 --> 02:55:25,480
I don't know.

3538
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:26,480
And then...

3539
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:30,680
It's a shame how that has all been ruined, but anyway.

3540
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:36,880
Now, I'm sure you're aware of Just Dance and how it's a popular franchise, and a lot of

3541
02:55:36,880 --> 02:55:41,760
these smaller developers out there like to, you know, knock off this game and put out

3542
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:44,000
their own dancing game.

3543
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:50,840
So one of these companies, Oxygen Games, I believe, or OG International, which sounds

3544
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:57,920
a little bit funnier, they have a game called Get Up and Dance, and it's really hilarious.

3545
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:06,560
Actually, I got to show you, I forgot to pull up the other screenshot, but basically, the

3546
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:11,880
game looks almost exactly, I mean, straight down to the art style like Just Dance 3.

3547
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:17,920
But anyways, there was this court case from Ubisoft suing the company, saying that, you

3548
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:25,480
know, you guys can't release this because this is violating copyright, and basically

3549
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:28,720
you're just creating a game that's exactly the same as ours.

3550
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:30,560
And apparently, though, the judge...

3551
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:33,560
Wait, wait, did you say the game is called Get Up and Dance?

3552
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,560
Get Up and Dance.

3553
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:35,880
Because there's a total Bimani joke in there.

3554
02:56:35,880 --> 02:56:37,880
Did you get it?

3555
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:52,760
Anyway, so the court, though, has allowed, because Ubisoft, one of the things they wanted

3556
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:58,440
to do was put a temporary restraining order on the publisher to not be able to put this

3557
02:56:58,440 --> 02:56:59,440
game out.

3558
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:02,040
So they have been denied.

3559
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:06,240
Ubisoft cannot restrain the release of this game.

3560
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:09,880
It's supposed to be published in North America on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

3561
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:13,560
Of course, you know, the PlayStation 3 being the move version.

3562
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:18,960
But yes, the game looks exactly, I mean, straight down to the artwork exactly like Just Dance.

3563
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:25,160
Of course, it will not sell as well as Just Dance.

3564
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:31,120
Alright, that's it for last minute stories.

3565
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,640
Alright, like, there's at least three people who get the joke.

3566
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:37,840
At least, I can count at least three people in chat who should understand that joke.

3567
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:38,840
At least.

3568
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:39,840
Alright.

3569
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:44,680
Anyhow, that's going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

3570
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:46,080
Aw, sad face.

3571
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:49,960
Alright, but thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

3573
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:51,960
We appreciate the support.

3574
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:52,960
We do.

3575
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:53,960
We're com...

3576
02:57:53,960 --> 02:57:54,960
Yes, we do.

3577
02:57:54,960 --> 02:57:55,960
Girl.

3578
02:57:55,960 --> 02:57:57,040
We're commercial free.

3579
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:58,040
We appreciate it.

3580
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:01,220
All we ask, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

3581
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,960
Help us spread through word of mouth.

3582
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:04,920
We really appreciate it.

3583
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:07,800
Now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

3584
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:09,000
Dark Soccer, we'll start you tonight.

3585
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Your final thought.

3586
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:15,080
Um, I really have an obsession with fab.com lately, but I can't afford anything there

3587
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:18,000
except for my Helveta cards.

3588
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,880
My final thought is, um, I won at least one piece of tier 13 Looking for Raid by this

3589
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:25,280
time next week.

3590
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:27,320
Loki, your final thought tonight.

3591
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:32,120
My final thought is I've been looking for some good cage match songs and I found one.

3592
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:34,560
All right, that's going to do it.

3593
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:36,280
Thank you guys once again for listening to our show.

3594
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:39,080
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

3595
02:58:39,080 --> 02:58:42,200
Have a wonderful night, everybody, and thanks for listening.

3596
