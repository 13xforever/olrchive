0	20000	Today, December 11th, 2011, an official Xbox Live app shows up on Apple devices.
20000	24720	One of the Operation Rainfall games is announced for release in Europe, and Metal Gear meets
24720	31640	Bayonetta in a new game trailer.
31640	34880	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34880	38840	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38840	45860	We are live tonight with the 438th episode of our show on this December the 11th of 2011.
45860	49740	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as she always does week in and week out, say
49740	53720	hello to one of my co-hosts, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53720	54720	Roar.
54720	55720	Roar!
55720	56720	How are you doing?
56720	57720	Roar.
57720	58720	You are a beast tonight.
58720	59720	I am.
59720	60720	Roar.
60720	61720	No, I'm doing-
61720	62720	Oh, now you're a sexy beast.
62720	63720	I'm always a sexy beast.
63720	64720	What are you talking about?
64720	66960	Except, you know, I'm really not.
66960	67960	I was today.
67960	70840	Talking about your outfit on Thursday, which we'll get to in a minute, that was, you were
70840	71840	a little bit of a sexy beast.
71840	72840	I like that outfit.
72840	73840	Oh, thank you.
73840	74840	You were rocking the flower in your hair.
74840	75840	I like that.
75840	78240	Even though my makeup got all screwed up by the end of the night.
78240	80680	Alright, we'll come back to Thursday in a minute, but first I've got to introduce the
80680	85320	other co-hosts who's here week in and week out, always find fast food dining when it
85320	87160	comes to six o'clock for our show.
87160	89120	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
89120	94800	It wasn't, it was out of necessity because all the other places had longer lines.
94800	97440	Oh, and the fast food choice for tonight is?
97440	98440	McDonald's.
98440	99440	Alright, which does not service-
99440	100440	That's not food.
100440	101440	It's, it's, it's-
101440	103520	Does not service an official endorsement of the program by any means.
103520	106800	No, I want, I am not endorsing McDonald's, that's for sure.
106800	111520	No, I've been actually trying to shy away from McDonald's, but the problem is on the
111520	116000	way to this show, it's like, okay, you've got Carl's Jr., Burger King, and McDonald's
116000	119040	and Carl's Jr. had a line of seven cars.
119040	122540	I didn't want to go to, I just decided not to go to Burger King cause it's kind of hard
122540	126000	to get into that parking lot, out of that parking lot.
126000	127000	But-
127000	128000	These are real problems, people.
128000	132480	And I had Burger King for like the last two days, so, you know, but they're chef's choice
132480	133480	burger, man.
133480	134480	It's good shit.
134480	136200	That is some good stuff.
136200	140480	This however, not good stuff, and this would be the double quarter pounder that they made
140480	141480	completely weird.
141480	142480	What?
142480	143480	No McRib?
143480	145520	Dude, the McRib is nasty, okay?
145520	146520	I'm sorry.
146520	147520	McRib is not-
147520	148520	No, I know.
148520	149520	The McRib is nasty.
149520	150520	But it's all everyone ever talks about.
150520	152760	Have you actually ever read the nutritional information on that?
152760	153760	No thank you.
153760	154760	That's because there isn't any.
154760	155760	Ha ha.
155760	156760	No, it's, it's there.
156760	158440	It's just not very nutritional.
158440	162660	Alright look, I gotta, believe it or not we're a podcast about video games and live show,
162660	163840	not just food.
163840	164880	But let me introduce the chatters.
164880	168440	I have to introduce of course our chat room, the lovely folks that join us week in and
168440	169440	week out live.
169440	173400	Because of course we are live at All Games Radio, which we are every Sunday night at
173400	177200	six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
177200	183780	And if you want to join us in the chat room, just point your browsers to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
183780	186720	Or of course if you have an IRC client, you can get on that way too by connecting to the
186720	190600	Game Church network and it's Channel Orange Lounge, but most people just prefer the easy
190600	191600	way out.
191600	192600	So there you go.
192600	193600	Choose whatever way you wanna do.
193600	195280	Come talk with us.
195280	199560	And some folks in there are talking about retweeting the show status.
199560	200640	Good, good, good idea.
200640	202440	Thank you for helping to promote the show.
202440	203440	Appreciate it.
203440	207720	And then MPRA2 is saying, well, back to Battlefield 3.
207720	210960	Sorry, OLR, I gotta unlock fire extinguisher for my jets.
210960	212640	So I guess we lost out to Battlefield tonight.
212640	213640	That makes me sad.
213640	215480	A lot of people have been playing Battlefield.
215480	218960	I always go on to see what everyone else is playing.
218960	219960	Very tempted.
219960	220960	A lot of times I see Saints Row.
220960	227920	I could go play some Saints Row, but Skyrim is, I need to do meaningless tasks in Skyrim.
227920	232840	Well, I was gonna say, no matter which friends list we're talking about, on my 360, everybody's
232840	233840	playing Skyrim.
233840	236120	On my PlayStation 3, everybody's playing Skyrim.
236120	237120	Like it really is...
237120	239360	Nah, last night it was all Battlefield 3.
239360	242780	Do you know what consistently, again, between the two systems is number one though?
242780	245640	What I see people on more than anything else on the systems?
245640	247280	The answer's easier than you think.
247280	248280	Modern Warfare 3?
248280	249280	Netflix.
249280	250760	Ah, yeah.
250760	251760	Even though...
251760	252880	Well, let's talk about this a little bit.
252880	255280	Let's get into games a little bit.
255280	259780	Talk about the new Xbox remodel that happened this week, because they launched the new Xbox
259780	260780	dashboard.
260780	262040	What do they call it?
262040	263040	The Xbox dashboard?
263040	265040	Is that what it's called?
265040	266040	Experience?
266040	267040	Experience?
267040	268040	I don't know what it is.
268040	269040	It's technically a dashboard, but...
269040	270320	So I guess what they're trying to do is they're trying to...
270320	271320	Call it boring.
271320	275520	Well, they're trying to integrate Kinect more into it, and have it be that way, but...
275520	276520	Whoopty shit.
276520	277520	Here it is.
277520	280960	Long story short, look, if you have a 360, you've probably already seen it.
280960	284280	The entire internet was trying to download it that day, and it was delayed, et cetera,
284280	285280	et cetera.
285280	288280	Everybody's seen it by now, but I gotta be honest, eh...
288280	289280	It's prettier.
289280	290280	I'll give it that.
290280	293120	The ads kind of stick out a lot more.
293120	295120	I noticed that too right away.
295120	302080	But it's really built for the Kinect, and I just think it's kind of eh...
302080	303080	Not a big fan of it.
303080	306660	I mean, the Kinect's cool and all, but I don't want it shoved down my throat, and I kind
306660	310800	of feel like this new Xbox redesign kind of really shoves the Kinect down your throat,
310800	314880	and like, I don't know about you guys, but in my apartment, the Xbox is not always that
314880	315880	res...
315880	318960	Or Kinect and all that is not always that responsive, and I don't wanna use it.
318960	323280	I mean, it's fine if I light things up to play Dance Central or whatever, but in my
323280	325960	low-lit apartment otherwise, I don't like to try and use Kinect.
325960	331320	I understand people, you know, think it's cool, and by people like me and Microsoft,
331320	336480	think it's cool to have voice commands and Kinect commands and stuff like that for all
336480	337520	the stuff in there.
337520	342560	You can wave your hand back and forth to scroll through the pages.
342560	349480	Or I can take less time, a fraction of a second less, to move my thumb slightly to the left
349480	354320	or right on my analog stick to do the exact same thing.
354320	356640	It's just like...
356640	357640	I don't understand...
357640	362640	I mean, yeah, you gotta support the Kinect, and that's fine that you wanna add more connectivity
362640	368960	to the dashboard, but I just...
368960	374320	I think it's unnecessary, and it's kind of a step backwards for a lot of things.
374320	376600	It made a lot of stuff a lot harder to find.
376600	378400	I mean, there's pros and there's cons.
378400	382360	On the one hand, it's really easy, like if I think of an old game that's on my Xbox that
382360	388720	I wanna play, like let's say Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, I can go play that game, which
388720	392440	maybe I haven't played in a long time, but otherwise, kind of digging through my collection
392440	398200	is a lot of key presses to get to, because you have to kind of scroll over.
398200	403880	It does kind of like that, it's a crossbar but not really thing, where I just...
403880	405520	It's weird.
405520	406520	I don't really like...
406520	410020	I mean, it's prettier, but in practicality, it's kind of an annoyance.
410020	414480	I think a lot of stuff's harder to find, although you have Bing if you know what you're looking
414480	416480	for.
416480	417880	Bing does not search the internet.
417880	421560	I think a lot of people assumed, because Bing is like a competitor to Google, that you'd
421560	425600	be able to like Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, and you get taken to our website, but now
425600	428640	no, if you try to Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think you get anything at all, because
428640	429640	we don't...
429640	433320	The icons that used to be up on the marketplace have been long gone.
433320	440800	The all games icons, they took down when the avatars launched, so you can still use them
440800	441800	if you have them.
441800	443680	Rob, you made me laugh just now.
443680	444680	Why?
444680	445680	What'd I do?
445680	446680	Magic the Gathering.
446680	448840	I don't know why I was thinking about that game the other day, and I'm not even talking
448840	452560	about Magic 2012, but there's like an older one, and I don't know.
452560	458000	Actually, here's what's funny, actually, on that kind of same note, like how this whole
458000	462680	thing has broken the Xbox, I tried to play the older Magic the Gathering game, because
462680	465000	I bought that first one that came out on Xbox Live some time ago.
465000	466000	I don't know why.
466000	469200	Sometimes you get a bug, and you just want to play a certain game, right?
469200	470920	You play shit tons of classic games.
470920	471920	Why?
471920	473620	Because you think about it, and you're like, I want to frickin' play that game.
473620	474680	So I wanted to play the Magic game.
474680	478600	So I go, Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering, and it finds it, and I go, okay, I'm going
478600	484040	into the game, and it launches the game, and it says, you need an update to play this game.
484040	487760	This update is no longer available, and it clits the game.
487760	494400	So this game I bought for ten bucks, maybe a year ago, like I can't play anymore because
494400	498440	they decided to remove the update, is like this trying to force me into the 2012 version
498440	499440	of the game.
499440	500440	I don't even know.
500440	502440	That kind of irritated me.
502440	506440	Technically we could get you the update, but I mean, it's still a pain in the ass to do
506440	507440	that.
507440	511360	It's just me meaning, you know, download it from the internet, but I shouldn't have to
511360	512360	do that, right?
512360	513360	That's right.
513360	514360	It should just work.
514360	517240	So anyway, I kind of think the new Xbox experience will end.
517240	520240	The whole reason I brought it up in the first place, going back to chat, and chat reminded
520240	524960	me of this, is that they took out the party feature from Netflix, which is kind of one
524960	529040	of the deals that people really loved about Netflix on the Xbox 360 is that it had the
529040	532640	party mode, and of course they're not really saying why.
532640	537880	And this just kind of further down that spiral of, boy, Netflix had to make a lot of unpopular
537880	538880	decisions this year.
538880	541960	And I'm not saying it's necessarily their fault, because I think they're feeling a lot
541960	546640	of pressures from movie studios and things like that, you know, as movie studios are
546640	550800	finally realizing, oh shit, the internet really is the wave of the future.
550800	551900	They're kind of having to adapt to it.
551900	556480	So I'm thinking the movie studio is probably pressured into removing the party feature,
556480	557960	because it never showed up on any other console.
557960	561400	Yeah, because if you think about it, oh, I want to watch a movie with my friends.
561400	564520	Well if you want to watch a movie with your friends, you're going to go buy the damn DVD.
564520	566400	That's what the movie studio is thinking, probably.
566400	571800	Yeah, it's a little weird, but there were some people that really liked that feature
571800	573120	that it got taken away.
573120	576900	I didn't realize how many people were using it until I saw the QQing on my Twitter.
576900	584360	So they made indie games harder to find, also.
584360	588800	I just, you know, download whatever I'm going to watch, and then watch it with a couple
588800	590800	of friends on AIM.
590800	592120	But I mean, I guess it was the same thing.
592120	597480	Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I really want to watch games, I mean, technically, technically, couldn't
597480	600880	I, and I don't know if this is possible, maybe the chat can help me out here, couldn't I
600880	607000	open up the Xbox party and open up one of those cross-game chat dealies, and then go
607000	611120	onto Netflix and say, okay, on the count of three, press the start button, one, two, three,
611120	612120	start.
612120	615640	Or, because it wouldn't really work, because people's bandwidth might be different, or...
615640	616880	I don't know, it might...
616880	618240	I would think you could still kind of do it.
618240	621240	You could wait five seconds before commenting or something, I don't know.
621240	622960	This is weird.
622960	628600	So, anyway, so the new Xbox experience gets up from me.
628600	631360	Other stuff going on in the gaming world this week before we get into specifically what
631360	632360	games we've been playing this week.
632360	634920	Of course, Dark Soccer and I already made reference to this earlier in the show.
634920	638740	We went to UMLoud on Thursday, which we've been trying to tell you guys on the show for
638740	642920	weeks and weeks now, like, check it out, go if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, or
642920	647600	check it out online at umloud.org, and thank you, Oil Army, you were noticed in the chat
647600	648840	room during the pre-show.
648840	654200	I was not able to see chat myself from where I was, but I had the word passed along that
654200	658360	people were saying hello and stuff, so I really appreciate you guys showing up in force.
658360	661600	I hope some of you guys were able to donate to what is a great cause.
661600	664360	But who wants backstage gossip from the show?
664360	667040	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, me, me, me, me, me, me.
667040	670200	I don't have negative stuff to say, no, I had a great time.
670200	674800	And so I'm sure those of you that watch the video feed, and if you haven't seen the video
674800	678660	feed yet, you can check it out, it is archived at umloud.org, and it takes you to the little
678660	685280	Ustream archived presentation, which was part of Game Spots, I guess, providing the bandwidth
685280	687560	or what have you for that whole thing.
687560	691260	You know, there were some audio problems in the beginning, which, you know, just my luck,
691260	694400	my first live shot's gonna go wrong, or something like that.
694400	698160	So it was very nerve-wracking, but at the end I was feeling a lot better with the interviews
698160	704000	and so forth, and people were very complimentary, so I was very happy, and got a lot of people
704000	707760	to come out and donate, which is the most important thing of all, of course, the donation.
707760	713920	But I just wanted to say, you know, despite all the technical things that happened, you
713920	718240	guys wouldn't believe how much change is on the fly when we're doing live stuff, especially
718240	719440	video from a big event.
719440	725720	I mean, OLR is one thing, this live environment, this hasn't bothered me for a long time, I
725720	731900	mean, this is kind of like my element, but doing video was a very, very interesting experience.
731900	737240	But having the very professional people from the AV Society that were helping to put it
737240	741560	on was such a relief, because, like, truly, and I'm not just saying this to kiss ass because
741560	747040	I truly, truly feel this way, like, everybody was super professional and just super awesome.
747040	748040	And were people stressed out?
748040	749040	Sure.
749040	750240	I mean, there was a lot to get stressed out about.
750240	754240	Some guests weren't there, and some video clips weren't around, you know, it stings.
754240	757440	We get stressed out at OLR when the internet goes down and we can't do our show like we
757440	758440	planned.
758440	762560	You know, things happen, but it's kind of the way that people kind of react to those
762560	764320	change and still interact with each other.
764320	767120	I just really felt there was still like a really high level of professionalism.
767120	770320	So I just got to give kudos to all those people that put it on.
770320	771840	I mean, was it scary?
771840	772840	Yes.
772840	773840	But was it rewarding?
773840	774840	Absolutely.
774840	775840	Absolutely.
775840	777440	So I had a fantastic time.
777440	778440	And you were cute.
778440	779440	Your hat was cute.
779440	780440	Thank you.
780440	781440	Thank you.
781440	782440	Thank you.
782440	783440	Thank you.
783440	784440	I have a little thread.
784440	785440	Yes.
785440	786680	A coworker went shopping with me the other night.
786680	791440	We bought an all new outfit, so I'm like, oh, I like that shirt, but I understand Alan
791440	792440	stealing it from you.
792440	793440	Yes.
793440	794440	Yes.
794440	797520	That's what happens is that, you know, I buy a shirt and then, you know, Alan says, no,
797520	798520	I want that shirt.
798520	799520	Steal.
799520	802720	No, I'm wearing the shirt that I bought for that night, but I really just bought it to
802720	809180	wear under that, uh, my hoodie, uh, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
809180	811520	Kaijuto says no cat fights backstage.
811520	812520	No, no.
812520	813520	It's all in the name of charity.
813520	814520	Actually.
814520	815520	I gotta say this.
815520	816520	This is the cool thing is that, you know, and I was mentioning this a little bit.
816520	821320	On the call on Bobby show is that, you know, one of the other co-hosts was really well
821320	826200	known on Twitch TV and it was streamed on Ustream and you had people behind the scenes
826200	830520	from GameSpot and IGN, but you know what, at the end of the day, who cares?
830520	831520	Who cares?
831520	832520	It's for charity.
832520	835900	Like, you know, day jobs and all those allegiances and so forth are one thing and the communities
835900	839840	we're into, but at the end of the day, it isn't about us and about our ego.
839840	844800	Everybody really did truly check those in at the door because it was about the charity.
844800	849080	And I honestly, the people I was working with anyway, I don't think have ego anyway.
849080	850880	So you know, I didn't sense that at all.
850880	855680	I ran into one thing that I'm really not going to discuss, but I think I did a very fluid
855680	859360	sidestep of drama.
859360	861640	Well you know why I say fluid?
861640	863240	Because I drank.
863240	867040	Anytime you get a group of nerds together, it's always bound to be a hilarious time.
867040	872480	Anyhow, going to our other chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw says everyone loved your beard Rob.
872480	876080	You know, Tiger Claw, I seem to remember you specifically thought the beard was weird at
876080	877080	first.
877080	880440	So I'm glad you've come full circle and come to embrace the beard that I started a couple
880440	881440	months ago.
881440	883720	I appreciate it.
883720	888040	Let's see, going back to our chat room, Act Def says, I did watch UMLoud live.
888040	889360	I did see the last part of the pre-show.
889360	890360	Well, thank you.
890360	891360	It was good times.
891360	892360	It was really good times.
892360	895100	And they actually, it wasn't just the pre-show they broadcast live, but they broadcast the
895100	896540	whole thing, all the bands.
896540	901380	And I got to say, just hilarious, imaginative bands.
901380	905760	And if you missed us talking about what UMLoud is on last week's show, in a nutshell, people
905760	910560	pay money to play rock band on an actual concert stage.
910560	914360	And so of course they go all out and all the money goes to the Child's Play charity.
914360	915520	I liked the Aperture band.
915520	919960	Oh yeah, the one that was all dressed up like Devo, the Devoid or whatever, that was phenomenal.
919960	924160	And even that very first band that came out after the introduction, they were all dressed
924160	928000	up like Harry Potter characters and they did You Oughta Know for whatever reason.
928000	933000	But I was like, they're Gryffindor kids singing You Oughta Know.
933000	934000	It's funny.
934000	935000	That was pretty funny.
935000	936000	But it was, it's great.
936000	940940	Everybody went all out and you know what, I'll tell you this, here's something you didn't
940940	944360	hear on the pre-show literally because the mic was dead.
944360	947760	The first guy I'm interviewing, you don't unfortunately hear that interview at all because
947760	950320	the mic wasn't working and it had to do with the wireless.
950320	953360	You'll notice it switches from a wireless to a wired because for whatever reason the
953360	955200	wireless connection just died.
955200	957960	But the first guy I'm interviewing, he actually talked about his band.
957960	962960	He was in the band Gay Riot was the name of the band and they were doing a David Bowie
962960	963960	song.
963960	967040	But it was really funny when we were talking about it because I said, well, he said the
967040	969520	lead singer was going to dress up like David Bowie.
969520	972120	And I said, I said, well, you know, where's he getting the idea or whatever?
972120	973120	Where'd you guys get this idea?
973120	975200	And he said, oh, well, his girlfriend put him up to it.
975200	979040	I said, so you guys are called Gay Riot, but David Bowie's girlfriend put him up to it.
979040	980040	He's like, yep.
980040	982040	I said, well, with David Bowie, you never can tell these things.
982040	985320	So there's something you missed out on by there not being audio.
985320	986900	That was, that was a fun interview.
986900	988620	I feel sorry for that guy.
988620	989620	They were all good sports.
989620	995240	These people completely pulled, like for real, like I will admit, like the raffle fairy,
995240	996600	Amanda, she's a good friend of mine.
996600	1001380	So I, of course I wanted to bring her on, but a lot of those people were complete strangers
1001380	1003460	and really good sports and some great interviews.
1003460	1005200	I had a fun time.
1005200	1010880	I had a good time too, because I got, I was helping to test out the free play setup, which
1010880	1014840	I set up half of it before my hand said no.
1014840	1018000	And um, you were singing a lot of songs in there before they opened the doors.
1018000	1024040	I heard, yeah, well, I always have to, I can't use earplugs because they always make my ears
1024040	1030680	hurt more for some reason, but I have this fear of being out of key, which people who
1030680	1033120	know me know why I have that problem.
1033120	1037880	So I was trying to make sure everything was set up and finally there was this one dude
1037880	1043040	in there who was a super cool and we played a band on the run and that made me happy because
1043040	1047520	anyone who appreciates Paul McCartney in the wings is cool in my book.
1047520	1048520	All right.
1048520	1052160	Go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com.
1052160	1056540	Tiger Claw says, Rob, it would have been great if you got on stage and sang some of the songs.
1056540	1061420	You know, I, I would have done it, but I wasn't sure if I could because of the other stuff
1061420	1065040	I was doing, but I think in retrospect, I probably still would have just been able to
1065040	1067100	buy a band spot and been on at the end.
1067100	1069080	So maybe next year, like I'm not opposed to it.
1069080	1070080	It's for a good cause.
1070080	1071080	It's a great thing.
1071080	1072080	We bought raffle tickets.
1072080	1075400	I, we, Alan and I won a raffle prize.
1075400	1079920	I haven't got to play it yet because, um, we had, we had to leave before it was over
1079920	1083700	because keep in mind, San Francisco is a two hour drive and I had to work the next day
1083700	1085580	with a morning meeting.
1085580	1091240	So we won the raffle prize late, but we won some fishing game on the way from the raffle,
1091240	1093840	but we bought a handful of raffle tickets and walked out of there with that.
1093840	1099440	So anyway, I, I won't talk about it all night, but it was a incredible time.
1099440	1104540	Met a lot of great people, um, can't wait for next year and, um, go watch the live feed
1104540	1106400	and if you like it, fricking donate.
1106400	1107400	It's a great cause.
1107400	1112940	I mean, remember there's a lot of kids in hospitals that would just love to have just
1112940	1117100	any some of these expensive systems we talk about, like three DS and some of this stuff,
1117100	1120680	you know, even if they're too young to enjoy this stuff, child's play goes so far to get
1120680	1122360	like coloring books and things like that.
1122360	1125620	You know, remember this is just a really tough time of year.
1125620	1129720	You know, a lot of kids, you know, sometimes don't easily have access to that stuff when
1129720	1131160	they're going through a really hard time.
1131160	1132760	So child's play kind of helps deliver that.
1132760	1133960	So just think about that.
1133960	1134960	No stuffed animals.
1134960	1140520	It's actually the only thing, um, if you're going to donate a toy, do not donate a stuffed
1140520	1142640	animal because they do carry germs.
1142640	1143640	Interesting.
1143640	1144640	It has to be something that can be sterilized.
1144640	1146040	I didn't think about that.
1146040	1147040	I just donate money.
1147040	1148040	Yeah.
1148040	1149040	Money.
1149040	1150040	Money's good.
1150040	1151040	So, all right.
1151040	1152040	Anyhow, uh, umlab.org.
1152040	1153880	So how about our gaming weeks?
1153880	1158480	Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week and enjoying, um, in
1158480	1160880	our time that we're not trying to raise money for charity.
1160880	1162880	Dark Sakura?
1162880	1163880	I'm sorry.
1163880	1164880	What?
1164880	1165880	How was your gaming week?
1165880	1166880	That's the question.
1166880	1167880	I know.
1167880	1168880	That was my answer.
1168880	1169880	Um, what?
1169880	1170880	You played rock band.
1170880	1171880	I played rock band.
1171880	1172880	I played some well.
1172880	1178820	I was going to play dance masters yesterday, um, but I was feeling really crappy.
1178820	1179820	Really crap.
1179820	1180820	I was bugging you to do that too.
1180820	1181820	You were.
1181820	1182820	I was gonna.
1182820	1186880	I was gonna do everything and then I was like, I got out of my seat and everything.
1186880	1191080	No, I was going to go in and set it up and then I was just not feeling well.
1191080	1194080	We had a busy beginning of the week cause I know you had a lot of rush design projects
1194080	1196700	and I had a lot of design to do.
1196700	1199800	I had, um, I had umlaude.
1199800	1204960	I had the American river review release party, which by the way, the 2012 American river
1204960	1205960	review is out.
1205960	1211840	If you go to arc.losrios.edu and go to the bookstore link, you can order a copy.
1211840	1215200	So if our international audience wants to see what the local community college here
1215200	1216200	tell.
1216200	1221920	I'm going to, I'm going to tell why people internationally will like it because it actually
1221920	1230080	wins national awards, beats out the big four year schools and has some amazing literature
1230080	1234280	and artwork in it this year and culinary recipes, which I laid out.
1234280	1235960	Look at you showing your college pride.
1235960	1236960	I love it.
1236960	1237960	I'm pretty proud of it.
1237960	1238960	You should be.
1238960	1241640	Well, ARC is like the biggest, um, junior college in California.
1241640	1245720	Is there any video gaming content in the magazine?
1245720	1247860	Not quite, but there's plenty of pop culture.
1247860	1248860	Maybe you should.
1248860	1250960	That should be something you should think about for next year.
1250960	1251960	Just saying.
1251960	1255440	Well, I'm hoping next year we actually get some of the 3d modelers putting their stuff
1255440	1256440	in.
1256440	1257440	Okay.
1257440	1258440	Well that's cool.
1258440	1264320	Because like, well when I took the 3d class, I did a turret from portal.
1264320	1265320	I remember that.
1265320	1267120	That was a really cute little thing you did.
1267120	1269320	And other people have done, you know, different.
1269320	1275200	One person did a Game Boy Advance, you know, so I'm saying you get, there's, um, there's
1275200	1276200	definitely references.
1276200	1280840	I mean, a lot of the stories in there, there's definitely a few, uh, geeks doing the writing.
1280840	1283720	So but I think that it's worthwhile.
1283720	1287960	So really that's what my, um, that and UmLoud have really been what's taken up the bulk
1287960	1288960	of my week.
1288960	1296400	Not really specifically gaming, but it's been two worthy things that I was proud to have
1296400	1297400	been involved in this week.
1297400	1298400	All right.
1298400	1299400	That's good to me.
1299400	1300400	Fair compromise.
1300400	1301400	Loki, how about you?
1301400	1304280	You sadly couldn't make it to UmLoud because you know you have other obligations, but what
1304280	1305280	did you do this week?
1305280	1309860	Uh, I played Skyrim, mostly.
1309860	1316640	And I swear I waste so much time doing meaningless tasks like item management and what I can
1316640	1317640	carry with me.
1317640	1324680	And I have, I was literally today spending time at the, uh, enchantment table or whatever
1324680	1333520	to give my armor some extra, um, lifting abilities so I can just carry more crap with me as I'm
1333520	1334520	going around.
1334520	1339760	Um, I did one of the quests, which was, uh, I think it was called a night to remember
1339760	1340920	or something like that.
1340920	1347120	And where you get drunk and somehow end up like on the completely other side of the world.
1347120	1348520	And that's kind of what happened.
1348520	1354400	And so I've been journeying my way back, but thankfully I could fast travel back to Whiterun
1354400	1360480	to dump my crap into a cabinet, which this cabinet must have an infinite amount of space
1360480	1361480	because I...
1361480	1362480	It's a big cabinet.
1362480	1363480	It's a very big cabinet.
1363480	1367840	What you don't see in Skyrim is that at the other end of the cabinet is the door to Narnia.
1367840	1370960	So you just have all of Narnia to store your shit.
1370960	1373440	It pretty much is like that.
1373440	1376000	Um, and it was, it was...
1376000	1380920	Black Wolf in our chat room says, Loki was lollygagging.
1380920	1387600	And it's funny though, cause like I had to dump off, like I had 150 carrots, 150 carrots
1387600	1388800	for no reason whatsoever.
1388800	1390180	You wascally wabbit.
1390180	1394200	So the first thing I started doing is like, I'm going to eat all these carrots right now.
1394200	1399080	So I was like hammering down A, but it just took forever to do that.
1399080	1402080	Your skill in vitamin A has increased to 22.
1402080	1405200	So I decided I'm going to make it rain.
1405200	1411160	So I ran upstairs into this, like, uh, in this general goods store, ran upstairs to
1411160	1415000	the balcony and I was going to throw the carrots off the balcony and want to see like a pile
1415000	1416000	of carrots.
1416000	1417000	And you get a carrot!
1417000	1418000	And you get a carrot!
1418000	1419080	And you get a carrot!
1419080	1422200	But no, unfortunately it doesn't do it like that.
1422200	1427000	You would have to drop each one individually, um, because otherwise it drops them in piles
1427000	1429320	of like 109 and stuff.
1429320	1431480	It was very unepic.
1431480	1435120	So um, so yeah, I didn't do that.
1435120	1438760	But um, I don't know, I've just been playing a lot.
1438760	1442680	I think I actually looked at my playtime, I have like 36 hours in the game, and I've
1442680	1443920	done like nothing.
1443920	1446520	And I've probably further progressed in the story than you.
1446520	1448960	I've done like hardly anything in there.
1448960	1453160	I like to go, I like to find the random dungeons, but then I'm like, oh I don't want to explore
1453160	1456480	this dungeon because somebody in the nearby town might have a quest.
1456480	1460280	So I need to go to the quest and talk to everybody until I find the, and then I'm picking every
1460280	1463360	single fucking flower on the way because I can't stop!
1463360	1464360	Yeah.
1464360	1469640	And the game is horrible for people who have, like, because I go in with the JRPG mindset
1469640	1470920	from Final Fantasy, right?
1470920	1474640	Gotta find every treasure box, gotta open everything, gotta get every item, I want my
1474640	1477160	perfect run through, 999 everything, right?
1477160	1479840	Like you take that mindset to Skyrim, you are fucked.
1479840	1485000	You'll never get anything done, and you will have 150 carrots in your goddamn bag because
1485000	1486680	you picked every single one.
1486680	1487880	Like that's...
1487880	1492120	I go through all the towns searching the barrels, and I know very well that there's not gold
1492120	1493120	in those barrels.
1493120	1498200	Like carrots, or apples, or tomatoes, or maybe cabbage that's worth nothing.
1498200	1501280	Carrots are literally worth nothing, you cannot sell them for any money whatsoever.
1501280	1502860	But you can eat them!
1502860	1505260	You can eat them, or drop them on the ground.
1505260	1508560	You know that if you eat too many carrots it will turn you orange?
1508560	1512280	I shit you not, that happened to me when I was two, and I had to go to the ER.
1512280	1515500	It's actually happened to several famous people, like one of them was, what was her name that
1515500	1517720	played the older sister on the Partridge family?
1517720	1518720	I don't know.
1518720	1520480	Susan Day, wasn't that her?
1520480	1521480	Okay, sure.
1521480	1525200	But she ate nothing but carrots, like, and they had to tell her to stop eating carrots
1525200	1527840	because she turned orange on screen.
1527840	1529360	Come on, get orange!
1529360	1530360	Trivia!
1530360	1531360	But, um...
1531360	1535240	If I'm ever on Useless Crap Jeopardy, I'll remember that.
1535240	1539720	I'm trying to think if there's any other funny stuff that's happened, like, glitch-wise and
1539720	1540720	stuff.
1540720	1541720	Because I know there has been.
1541720	1547520	Uh, yeah, like, exploring random things, I went into a cottage, and there was this really
1547520	1549720	powerful wizard in the cottage that wanted to kill me.
1549720	1552520	I was like, oooookay.
1552520	1560040	Um, or the, what is it, there's like some sort of, there's like so many bands of, like,
1560040	1563920	I've lost track of all the different groups in the games, like, you know, they have the
1563920	1572480	Imperials and the Stormcloaks, and then they have the, the, what was it, the Followers,
1572480	1577960	or like, this is, and then some other weird band that's somewhere else that has these
1577960	1583520	weird, like, bone weapons that, they apparently suck, though, because I kicked the crap out
1583520	1589240	of them, but, um, yeah, so I played, basically I played lots of Skyrim, didn't really do
1589240	1594120	much, um, in the game, other than, you know, going around.
1594120	1599360	I did happen, though, I was walking along, and I saw these people wandering, there were
1599360	1604520	traders that were bringing gifts for a wedding that was the cousin of, like, some head of
1604520	1606960	the trade council or something like that.
1606960	1613000	And so they're like, and they're basically like, oh, um, you know, we really should get
1613000	1618080	on our way, and then one of the options was, I'm gonna take those gifts from you.
1618080	1620000	So that's one of the options I did.
1620000	1622480	And then I murdered them and stole their gifts.
1622480	1624760	And I'm not, I think that's part of a quest, but I'm not really sure.
1624760	1627000	Okay, last Skyrim thing, and then we've got to move on, okay?
1627000	1628560	Well, someone actually did have a question.
1628560	1629560	What?
1629560	1630560	In the chat?
1630560	1632040	Yeah, did you offer the wizard carrots, Loki?
1632040	1636040	Except I think it's a statement because he didn't use any, um, punctuation.
1636040	1637040	Okay.
1637040	1638040	No, I did not.
1638040	1639040	All right.
1639040	1640040	I got to play this.
1640040	1641040	Bobby sent this to me.
1641040	1642040	He said, don't play the sound.
1642040	1643040	So I guess there's talking or whatever over it.
1643040	1644040	But he says music.
1644040	1645040	It's funny.
1645040	1646040	Is it?
1646040	1647040	Oh, you've heard this?
1647040	1648040	Yes.
1648040	1650040	He says it's 2,500 cheese wheels rolling off a mountain.
1650040	1652040	Let's see here.
1652040	1653040	It's awesome.
1653040	1654040	It's done with console commands.
1654040	1655040	Okay.
1655040	1656040	Oh, there they all go.
1656040	1662040	That is a mountain of cheese.
1662040	1663040	There's your whole.
1663040	1668040	See, that's the kind of epic.
1668040	1672220	What about this 4,200 cabbages going downhill in the related video?
1672220	1675040	This is really fast forward over there.
1675040	1676040	Oh, there they go.
1676040	1679860	All the cabbages going downhill.
1679860	1680860	That's not Skyrim music.
1680860	1681860	What the hell is that?
1681860	1682860	It's like.
1682860	1683860	I don't know.
1683860	1684860	It's like techno porn music.
1684860	1685860	It's like porno music.
1685860	1688860	That's tech demo music, Rob.
1688860	1693860	If you like cabbages, that's like tech demo music, seriously, you like Skyrim.
1693860	1696620	I got the video for you.
1696620	1698620	Welcome to Skyrim Rob Live.
1698620	1702620	I mentioned last week or maybe the week before last that once you do a few quests for people
1702620	1706540	that all of a sudden they started trusting you with their possessions, which means that's
1706540	1711260	the prime time to go clear out all the possessions out of their houses, including all the goblets
1711260	1712260	and stuff.
1712260	1715700	That's not even worth money, but because I'm a klepto, I have to take everything.
1715700	1719860	I found out that after a while they restock all their stuff in their house.
1719860	1724700	So I went to the castle again and took everything out of the castle again and then threw them
1724700	1725700	off the mountain.
1725700	1726700	All right.
1726700	1727700	Can we move on?
1727700	1729700	I want to talk about something other than Skyrim.
1729700	1731420	Skyrim's been out almost a month now.
1731420	1733580	Oh, and play lots of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare.
1733580	1734580	It's awesome.
1734580	1735580	All right.
1735580	1736580	Actually, Skyrim's been out one month today.
1736580	1737580	Today's December 11th.
1737580	1738580	Anyway.
1738580	1739580	All right.
1739580	1740580	Other games.
1740580	1741580	My gaming week.
1741580	1742580	Yay.
1742580	1743580	I'm going to talk about three games.
1743580	1744580	Three new things I played this week.
1744580	1745580	Okay.
1745580	1752060	On the Xbox 360, I checked out Apples to Apples, which is the translation of the ever popular
1752060	1753560	card party game.
1753560	1754560	I don't even...
1754560	1756940	I can't fathom how that works.
1756940	1759860	Well, it's not like...
1759860	1761700	It's pretty much what you'd think.
1761700	1765000	If you're playing an Xbox Live, there's single player and then there's Xbox Live.
1765000	1767580	So Xbox Live is the obvious mode, right?
1767580	1770160	You go in and it goes around.
1770160	1771160	It's just like the game.
1771160	1775140	And if you've never played the game before, you have green cards which have words like...
1775140	1780420	They're like adjectives, like depressing or things like that might be one of the green
1780420	1781420	cards.
1781420	1787180	And then the red cards all have nouns or time periods, celebrities, person place things
1787180	1788220	type of stuff.
1788220	1792760	And you have to play the card that you think the judge for that round who drew the green
1792760	1794260	card will pick.
1794260	1797260	And for example, one of the red cards is Helen Keller.
1797260	1798740	And that will always win every round.
1798740	1802540	And I'm proud to say Helen Keller is in the Apples to Apples 360 game.
1802540	1803620	It had to be there.
1803620	1809780	So if somebody plays the green card sassy and I play Helen Keller, then somebody might
1809780	1811940	pick that as the winner.
1811940	1815520	And then the winner gets a point and then whoever gets 5, 10 points, whatever the game's
1815520	1818080	rules are first, wins the game.
1818080	1823300	So that's cool and all, but it's Xbox Live and you never really know the people on Xbox
1823300	1824300	Live.
1824300	1829680	And what I notice is that political jokes on cards are really hard to make on Xbox Live
1829680	1831560	because you might get a card.
1831560	1833060	What was the one I got today?
1833060	1840020	It was something like oppressive and somebody played Ronald Reagan and like, I thought it
1840020	1841020	was funny.
1841020	1842020	I'm like, I get it.
1842020	1846020	I it's a joke, but somebody else is like, whatever, you know, and like it started this
1846020	1847260	whole political discussion.
1847260	1850420	I'm just like, come on, it's Apples to Apples people.
1850420	1851420	This isn't fun.
1851420	1853380	What about the single player?
1853380	1854700	How the hell does that work?
1854700	1856340	It's the single player is Boggle.
1856340	1857660	You ever play Boggle?
1857660	1862520	So you know that where you find the words in the mixed grid of letters.
1862520	1866820	And so in the first few levels, you're just trying to figure out what red card would the
1866820	1868700	computer pick.
1868700	1870020	And it's really obvious.
1870020	1874080	Like it's all these big stereotypes, like Helen Keller, no, the Apple might be dressed
1874080	1875840	up like a princess.
1875840	1881260	And so the card might be something like, you know, pretty and the cards you get are like
1881260	1886300	nuclear war, uh, you know, oatmeal and diamonds.
1886300	1888920	And so a princess of course is going to pick diamonds.
1888920	1892540	So you have to find in the board D I A O M and he spell out diamonds.
1892540	1893580	It's kind of dumb.
1893580	1897740	That sounds like racial profiling to me a little bit.
1897740	1901580	It's stereotyping a lot, but especially when you start getting into like the Cowboys and
1901580	1902800	the hippies and all that stuff.
1902800	1908420	But anyway, it gets impossibly hard though when words just disappear from the red cards
1908420	1914340	and now it'll be like, it'll like the red card will be rock and question, question,
1914340	1915420	question, question.
1915420	1920060	And so you have to look on the board and be able to find role and know that it goes with
1920060	1921060	rock.
1921060	1924160	And not only that, you have to figure out which one of the three cards it's, it's as
1924160	1927520	impossible to figure out how to play as it is to figure out how I'm explaining it to
1927520	1928520	you to be honest.
1928520	1931580	So single player gets weird fast.
1931580	1936560	So I honestly think apples to apples is only going to be fun if you have people to play
1936560	1937560	it with.
1937560	1938560	And how much was it again?
1938560	1939560	10 bucks.
1939560	1944240	And honestly, for that price, you should go to target and actually buy apples to apples.
1944240	1948960	I mean, really, you'll have more fun with real people than you will, I think online.
1948960	1954840	Sorry to say, but, um, you know, for, I guess a card game going to a flash game from a technical
1954840	1957720	perspective would be, it integrates with Facebook.
1957720	1961920	If you want to spam your achievements for everybody, I don't see every Xbox game doing
1961920	1962920	that.
1962920	1963920	So I guess some people are into that.
1963920	1964920	All right.
1964920	1970660	Uh, since you brought up games that are party games that have been translated to the Xbox,
1970660	1974200	here's a challenge for any developers out there that I think this would be perfect.
1974200	1978240	For an indie game, because the sure as hell aren't going to bring the Xbox live arcade
1978240	1979240	eat poop.
1979240	1980240	You cat.
1980240	1981240	Oh yeah.
1981240	1982240	Yeah.
1982240	1984000	You've talked about this on the show before, but for those, for those who don't know what
1984000	1988640	game you're talking about, it's basically like a visual telephone.
1988640	1993920	You start off by writing a phrase, you know, it could be like, I like apples.
1993920	1998840	And then the next person draws what draws a picture of the phrase.
1998840	2003080	And then, uh, the person after that, the first phrase is hidden.
2003080	2006280	So all they see is the picture and they have to come up with a new caption for it.
2006280	2010000	And it goes on from there until, especially when you get people that can't draw at all
2010000	2011000	like me.
2011000	2012840	Yeah, it goes on from there.
2012840	2018040	But I think that'd be hilarious to do like a, you know, a game like that.
2018040	2022320	Maybe have Xbox live support or something like that.
2022320	2026440	Alpha Kana gram in our chat room is going so far as to correct me and even saying, but
2026440	2029740	sky it's $20 is target at target.
2029740	2030740	It's double.
2030740	2031840	Well, well hold on.
2031840	2036360	Alpha Kana gram, I'm going to one up you because if you want to play with your friend on Xbox,
2036360	2038400	you both have to buy the game.
2038400	2044800	So that's $10 each ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2044800	2046780	And more if you have more friends, right?
2046780	2051160	So anyhow, I love that somebody actually went to look that up.
2051160	2054040	I'm going to hope he just bought that as a Christmas present for somebody recently or
2054040	2056840	whatever it is he celebrates this time of year.
2056840	2057840	All right.
2057840	2061080	Um, anyhow, uh, so there was that other games I played this week, Mario Kart seven on the
2061080	2066360	three D S um, I'm going to say the exact same thing every other reviewer has said about
2066360	2067360	Mario Kart seven.
2067360	2068480	You ready?
2068480	2071800	It's Mario Kart.
2071800	2073760	That's really an accurate description.
2073760	2077840	I mean, you, you know, Mario Kart, anybody who's been playing games for a while knows
2077840	2078840	Mario Kart.
2078840	2082840	It's the same game that was on the DS and the it's on every Nintendo system and it's
2082840	2085980	on now on the three D S the three D is tasteful.
2085980	2087160	It's not over the top.
2087160	2089000	Uh, it's, it's done fine.
2089000	2090560	It's, it's fun to play with three D.
2090560	2092680	The online works just like the Wii.
2092680	2096700	This almost essentially feels like a port of the Wii game to the three D S but with
2096700	2098240	some newer tracks.
2098240	2101120	I don't understand some of the online stuff they integrated.
2101120	2106260	Like my three D S will randomly get these randoms, um, ghosts just seem to download
2106260	2107260	from online.
2107260	2108260	Randomly random ghosts.
2108260	2109260	Yes.
2109260	2110260	Randomly random.
2110260	2111260	It's super random.
2111260	2112400	It's more, it's redundantly redundant.
2112400	2116620	And it'll be like, you just got a new ghost and I'll be like, Oh, maybe I street passed
2116620	2120320	with somebody or maybe somebody on my friends list just, you know, somehow sent me a ghost
2120320	2121520	from through the internet.
2121520	2122520	How cool.
2122520	2128000	And then I'll, I'll race against the ghost and it'll be like, you beat Kanji cut text
2128000	2129000	from Japan.
2129000	2130400	And I'm like, I don't know this person.
2130400	2132180	Why did it send me this ghost?
2132180	2136640	So you get like random stuff, but you can do community stuff in Mario Kart.
2136640	2139800	I'm going to name my first born Kanji text from Japan.
2139800	2140800	Shut up.
2140800	2143480	Um, uh, you can do community stuff.
2143480	2148000	So of course, as we do for any new community thing that hits the internet, we have run
2148000	2150360	and hurriedly set up the OL army community.
2150360	2153440	I have no idea how community racing works for, from what I understand, there's like
2153440	2156140	a top three for the month and you can do all that.
2156140	2161160	So the friend code is posted on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR or sorry, community code.
2161160	2162280	It's different than a friend code.
2162280	2168000	The community code for the oil army is posted on Twitter and it's on our Facebooks as well.
2168000	2172480	Um, and I'm sure somebody will post it in chat in a matter of minutes at us because
2172480	2175800	live during the break tonight, I'm going to try and play it.
2175800	2179560	Now I understand it might be an entire grand prix race, so I might have to drop, but I'll
2179560	2182360	do at least a couple of races with you guys during the mid point break tonight.
2182360	2186240	I am planning on getting this game and actually I'm also planning, not even planning.
2186240	2188680	I am getting super Mario three land.
2188680	2191040	I will have it Friday.
2191040	2194400	Uh, tiger call on our chat says it's spot pass.
2194400	2197440	Yeah, I know it's spot pass, but it makes no sense.
2197440	2198440	Like I get spot passes.
2198440	2202560	Some of the other games I play like, uh, super Mario three, I know what it is.
2202560	2207280	It's all those Japanese developers that you, uh, street passed within.
2207280	2209200	Didn't you like do some at E3?
2209200	2213880	Do you think because I've exchanged data with them before, like at E3, now I'm getting all
2213880	2214880	their ghosts.
2214880	2215880	Really?
2215880	2216880	Yeah.
2216880	2219280	So I'm playing against Japanese developers and I'm kicking their ass.
2219280	2220280	Yeah.
2220280	2221280	Yeah, I think so.
2221280	2225880	I think if you cross reference those ghosts with, you know, really, yeah, cause that would
2225880	2228880	be a, that makes a lot of sense actually.
2228880	2230480	That's kind of weird.
2230480	2231880	Interesting.
2231880	2235160	I know somebody who got me a moto's me at E3.
2235160	2236160	No, no, no, no.
2236160	2237160	Hold on.
2237160	2238160	I'm sorry.
2238160	2243080	It's just the door is wide open for the jokes.
2243080	2248680	You might be easy to be because they are of a certain nationality and they're not, they're,
2248680	2256600	they're not typically good drivers.
2256600	2257600	Racism fail.
2257600	2258600	All right.
2258600	2262080	That's racism racing right there.
2262080	2263400	Stop.
2263400	2266760	All right.
2266760	2267760	But I will say this.
2267760	2271320	The other thing I got to say about Mario Kart seven is that a lot of really good retro tracks
2271320	2272320	came back.
2272320	2273600	Like a Waluigi pinball.
2273600	2274880	That track is so fun.
2274880	2277320	And some of the Wii tracks came back that are awesome too.
2277320	2278320	Here's my gripe.
2278320	2283160	And this has been since like, I think even the NDS one.
2283160	2288720	What's up with them bringing back the most terrible tracks for battle mode.
2288720	2294120	Like their, their decision, Hey, from the test before let's bring back the big donut
2294120	2295120	or something like that.
2295120	2299340	Like one of the, like the most, you know, kind of terrible.
2299340	2303160	Like they brought back Mario circuit two from the original super Nintendo game.
2303160	2305800	And like if I was going to bring back one of the courses in the super Nintendo game,
2305800	2309200	I would have brought back one of the ghost houses because those levels were epic.
2309200	2311160	I think they did that in the DS one though.
2311160	2312160	I know.
2312160	2315640	I mean, they pick, they pick these really random tracks that they bring back.
2315640	2319960	It's like, and you didn't want to bring back block four or you didn't want to bring back,
2319960	2323880	you know, um, I don't remember the one that they had that where's another one.
2323880	2328640	It was like a four tiered one that was on or three tiered one on the Nintendo 64 version.
2328640	2332720	That was pretty awesome, but Oh, those, you know, those are terrible.
2332720	2337320	We'll just bring back the donut or all the weird ones that they had in the Wii there
2337320	2339160	just made no sense.
2339160	2340800	All right.
2340800	2343160	Um, so that's Mario Kart seven.
2343160	2347960	It's Mario Kart, but it's like, look, if you have a three DS already, you probably have
2347960	2349560	already bought Mario Kart seven.
2349560	2351280	I don't know what else I can tell you.
2351280	2355920	If you've never played a Mario Kart game before, then go to a friend's house who has it and
2355920	2356920	use download play.
2356920	2359600	Cause you can do download play with one cart and there you go.
2359600	2360600	Instant demo.
2360600	2361600	All right.
2361600	2362600	One more.
2362600	2363600	You should have brought your system.
2363600	2364600	All right.
2364600	2365600	One more game.
2365600	2366600	I street pass with people at Umlaut too.
2366600	2372800	They have new houses in Mario three D land, toad houses and stuff, so anyway, one more
2372800	2375400	game to talk about this week, one more Unimas.
2375400	2378640	And it's a game that Loki loaned to me two weeks ago that I finally got around to playing
2378640	2379640	this week.
2379640	2380640	Yes.
2380640	2384440	I jumped in and I played saints row, the third, which is totally not the type of game I would
2384440	2388640	ever imagine myself playing because like, I get why people like grand theft auto, but
2388640	2394000	I'm always like, eh, you know what I'd rather play a role playing game or something, but
2394000	2397560	I decided to approach saints row three with an open mind and I got our saints row, the
2397560	2398560	third season with an open mind.
2398560	2400880	And I got to tell you, well, I should say this.
2400880	2404840	I played the first game in the series or I played like a extended demo or some, I played
2404840	2405840	it at friend's house or something else.
2405840	2406960	Kind of like, Oh, okay.
2406960	2407960	It's grand theft auto.
2407960	2408960	Huh?
2408960	2412240	So when this new one comes out, I'm like, Oh, and look, he's telling me, no, really.
2412240	2413680	It's it's like way over the top and it's crazy.
2413680	2414680	Now it's so fun.
2414680	2415680	Like it's not like the first game.
2415680	2416680	It's kind of like, Oh sure.
2416680	2417680	Lucky.
2417680	2418680	Sure.
2418680	2419680	You just, you just like this game.
2419680	2420680	That's cool.
2420680	2421680	That's cool.
2421680	2426560	And I have not laughed, I have not laughed this hard at a video game in a very long time.
2426560	2428620	It is so funny.
2428620	2431600	And it's funny because it's stupid as hell.
2431600	2436840	But in that getting together to watch a movie with your friends, that's really bad.
2436840	2440640	Like a Manos, the hands of fate, mystery science theater kind of way.
2440640	2443560	Like it was awful, great.
2443560	2450940	And I got to say just, I am actually really impressed at how well they integrate the whole
2450940	2454320	create your own character and get it into the experience.
2454320	2457220	Because like, you know, towards the beginning of the game, you're allowed to create whatever
2457220	2458640	kind of character you want.
2458640	2465860	You can create a boy, girl, big boobies, little boobies, you know, fat, skinny.
2465860	2470480	Although I would argue that their version of fat is not that fat, but whatever.
2470480	2474100	And you know, you can do whatever you can have your character run around naked for all
2474100	2475100	you care.
2475100	2476960	You know, you could, you can design your character.
2476960	2478840	It's a great creator.
2478840	2479840	And then you get to pick a voice.
2479840	2480840	Do you want a man voice?
2480840	2481840	Do you want a woman voice?
2481840	2483560	Or do you want to be a zombie?
2483560	2488860	And no matter what it is you pick, you're like fully integrated into the game as the
2488860	2491040	leader of this gang.
2491040	2497960	So I decided to make my character, I made kind of like, like a Pam Greer from a Blackspoitation
2497960	2503600	film in the 70s, if she had gigantic, well, she did have gigantic titties, but like unrealistically
2503600	2508540	big titties, because I took the tip meter as high as it would go.
2508540	2511040	And she's large and in charge.
2511040	2513960	And at first I was going to make her a grandma, but I decided, no, I'm going to scale back
2513960	2515080	the age a little bit.
2515080	2518240	So she's kind of like, she's like a husky kind of Pam Greer.
2518240	2523680	And it's like, what I love about it is that it flows so well with the, with the woman
2523680	2529200	voice and everything, like, like the way, I know what you guys are thinking, like, what
2529200	2530200	are you saying?
2530200	2531200	A woman can't be in charge or whatever.
2531200	2536580	But no, what I'm saying is that it's almost like they've recorded everything seven or
2536580	2543040	eight times or however many characters there are to get the script to work impressive,
2543040	2550280	that attention to detail on something so stupid, but it pays off tremendously.
2550280	2552680	That attention to detail pays off tremendously.
2552680	2554960	I was laughing so fucking hard.
2554960	2559600	I was crying during that airplane sequence where my character gets sucked out the door.
2559600	2564760	So her fat ass is rolling down the little shoot and then they're skydiving or whatever.
2564760	2568520	And there's this whole like skydiving sequence and you're, you're literally flipping upside
2568520	2571340	down to shoot people mid-air as you're skydiving.
2571340	2572960	And then you're flipping right side up.
2572960	2576200	And then like, you're going, are we about to fly through that plane window?
2576200	2578400	And you know, there's only one way we can do this.
2578400	2584080	And so you, you throw the chick off your back and she yells ASSHOLE as you throw her.
2584080	2588980	And just my character stays sassy the entire time, which is so true to the character I
2588980	2592740	wanted her to be.
2592740	2597760	Or you got to remember, to put this in perspective, last week or the week before I was talking
2597760	2603000	about White Knight Chronicles 2 on the PlayStation 3, where you also create a character, but
2603000	2604620	your character never talks.
2604620	2606380	Your character is a bystander.
2606380	2609080	Your character isn't integrated into the story at all.
2609080	2613280	I'm not saying this makes White Knight Chronicles a bad game, but when you put that side by
2613280	2618080	side with the lengths that they've gone to integrate whatever it is you want into Saints
2618080	2622740	Row the Third, I am like so impressed with that level of detail.
2622740	2628180	And just, just the fact that my character can get into a tank and blow shit up and,
2628180	2631420	and as Bobby was talking about in his show before when he was talking about the game,
2631420	2635900	and I noticed this too, I was so damn impressed with that sequence where you get in the car
2635900	2641260	and you're listening to the radio and Sublime's What I Got comes on the radio and you and
2641260	2645240	your, your gang member that you're driving with starts singing along to the song like
2645240	2650940	loving is what I got and they're, they're singing it the way people in that role would
2650940	2651940	really sing it.
2651940	2656340	You know, it's like there's a line in the song that goes like, but I can still get high
2656340	2663480	and like my character shouts like, you know, it like it's, it's little things like that
2663480	2668380	that just put this game in a caliber where it's like, you really like, I think you have
2668380	2669580	to experience it.
2669580	2672220	Like I Loki, you're right.
2672220	2674860	It's game is hilarious and it's fun to play.
2674860	2678060	But it's, I'm going to have to play it and only gets better.
2678060	2682740	It's just, it's like you think that the whole airplane thing was ridiculous.
2682740	2683740	Let me put it this way.
2683740	2687020	Have you seen the new, the new 18 movie?
2687020	2688940	You had no, I haven't seen the new 18 movie.
2688940	2689940	Okay.
2689940	2691660	Well there's, let me put it this way.
2691660	2697020	The first skydive sequence reminded me a lot of shoot them up the Clive Owen movie.
2697020	2702940	This their spoiler, there is a second skydive sequence at one point that reminds me a lot
2702940	2708540	of the a team where they try to fly a tank.
2708540	2709540	I can't, I can't stress.
2709540	2713260	And then, no, somebody in the chat room asked, Rama Rama asked if I gave my character an
2713260	2714260	Afro.
2714260	2715260	No, I did.
2715260	2718940	I, I gave, I gave her the long flowing hot black hair to go, you know, she's got the
2718940	2723380	volume of the Beyonce luminous, no, she has voluminous hair, kind of a modern, modern
2723380	2725940	day Jackie Brown, Pam Greer looking thing.
2725940	2730740	But um, just my character is so sassy and that's what I wanted her to be.
2730740	2732580	And it's great.
2732580	2736060	I did, I did play some more Saints Row the Third this week.
2736060	2737060	I forgot.
2737060	2741480	I, we've been playing horde mode during our lunch breaks and that game, horde mode is
2741480	2743900	pretty fun on its own actually.
2743900	2744900	It's just really ridiculous.
2744900	2746460	Some of the stuff that they have.
2746460	2749100	Now what cracks me up, Dark Sakura, when you play through the game, what you should do
2749100	2754340	is you should make a zombie because apparently if you play as a zombie, that is still integrated
2754340	2755660	in the story mode.
2755660	2763220	So like, you know, your characters will be talking, your characters like seriously what
2763220	2764220	they do.
2764220	2765220	Yeah.
2765220	2766220	What you said.
2766220	2769700	So you really think we should do that?
2769700	2771860	I don't want to play a zombie.
2771860	2776820	If I play it, I want to make a, you know, my type of character and the zombie will sing
2776820	2780220	what I got as well.
2780220	2783820	Travis Donovan over at under station live made me, he's been playing through the game
2783820	2786100	as me and apparently I like to run around.
2786100	2789740	I apparently I do this in real life with hot pink bunny slippers and a hello kitty backpack
2789740	2795240	because that's what the me character in the game has, but I imagine the game is hilarious
2795240	2801300	still because you're playing this guy and you know, probably still really funny with
2801300	2802300	all the outfits.
2802300	2807820	So just don't expect like you got to put a game like Saints Row the Third side by side
2807820	2814860	with Skyrim and they couldn't, they're so different, but they're both like open world
2814860	2816020	games and so forth.
2816020	2821280	And I think, I think it's just one of those things where it's like, like Skyrim is the
2821280	2826900	Oscar nominated picture you see at the art house movie, which is a great experience and
2826900	2829700	you'll just, you'll be, you know, happy to have witnessed it.
2829700	2835220	And then it's basically, it's Laura, the rings and fucking transformers.
2835220	2839100	I mean, or no, it's like except transformers wasn't actually saints row.
2839100	2845340	The third is like getting high and going to see, um, pink Floyd's the wall set to the
2845340	2846340	lasers.
2846340	2847340	No.
2847340	2850740	Would it be the difference between watching Lord of the rings and Friday?
2850740	2851740	Yes.
2851740	2853740	That's a great analogy.
2853740	2856780	Friday is also an amazing movie, right?
2856780	2859140	It's hilarious, but not for the same reasons.
2859140	2861780	Friday is just fucking funny, right?
2861780	2862780	That's a great analogy.
2862780	2865260	I would compare it to like Lord of the rings in the movie.
2865260	2870860	Shoot them up, shoot them up is seriously like this game follows that movie.
2870860	2875860	I mean, there's a lot of stuff that they took straight out of just ridiculous actions sequences.
2875860	2880820	Um, like the whole, whole intro is seriously ripped off of that movie, but I don't care
2880820	2881820	cause it's awesome.
2881820	2884340	All right, let's go to one question from the chat room and then we'll, we got to get to
2884340	2885460	gaming news.
2885460	2887860	It's been like an hour and we're still talking about our gaming weeks.
2887860	2891300	Tiger class says, makes you wonder if they were ever to make a saints row movie, would
2891300	2892780	it be an action comedy?
2892780	2897220	Okay, look, whoever does the saints row movie, which I am all for at this point, like I think
2897220	2901820	I absolutely think they should make a saints row movie and I think it should be over the
2901820	2903660	top stupid funny.
2903660	2905180	Like it needs to be like airplane.
2905180	2906180	Okay.
2906180	2908820	So I think the Zucker brothers should do the saints row movie.
2908820	2912100	I need to just incorporate Leslie Nielsen in there somewhere.
2912100	2913100	He's dead.
2913100	2916100	I know, but I mean, it doesn't matter.
2916100	2917100	It doesn't matter.
2917100	2921240	They could, you know, work him in cause it would have to have through technology these
2921240	2922240	days.
2922240	2923240	Exactly.
2923240	2928380	Well they could, if they could do, you know, what was that last, um, Bruce Lee movie where
2928380	2932140	he's, you know, dead halfway through filming it.
2932140	2933140	I love it.
2933140	2939380	See her in our chat room says, I thought you guys were talking about the song Friday.
2939380	2943100	Still an accurate comparison.
2943100	2944780	Lord of the rings.
2944780	2948100	Rebecca blacks Friday was 17 gazillion YouTube views.
2948100	2949100	All right, look.
2949100	2954580	So that was my gaming week saints row, the third hilariously stupid, hilarious.
2954580	2955580	All right.
2955580	2959020	And I will play more of it because I just, I laugh consistently when I'm playing that
2959020	2960020	game.
2960020	2961020	And I think that's so important.
2961020	2963540	So, all right.
2963540	2964880	Sometimes you want final fantasy.
2964880	2966780	Sometimes you want Dick and fart jokes.

2987580	2989780	Um, we got a milkshake.
2989780	2990780	Where's mine.
2990780	2991780	All right.
2991780	2992780	Just kidding.
2992780	2994940	I, anyway, uh, I had Starbucks on the way here.
2994940	2998580	If you can't tell, I'm wired on coffee today on the first.
2998580	3000660	We should have a show as of right now.
3000660	3002140	It looks like we will have a show on the first.
3002140	3006200	I don't know if anybody who doesn't camp or whatever be here on the first.
3006200	3010600	So I think we're doing a show then, which is the exact opposite of Bobby who comes on
3010600	3011600	before us.
3011600	3013080	Bobby's going to do a show Christmas night.
3013080	3016260	So spend, spend your Christmas with Bobby here on all games radio and then spend your
3016260	3017260	new years with us.
3017260	3019260	We'll ring in 2012.
3019260	3020260	Okay.
3020260	3026020	Um, let's get into the gaming news, but surprisingly enough for this time of year when everybody's
3026020	3029380	getting ready to go on holiday breaks and everything, there's a lot of damn gaming news
3029380	3030380	going on.
3030380	3031380	Right?
3031380	3032380	Loki start us off.
3032380	3033380	Yeah.
3033380	3036180	We're going to be talking about this, uh, the spike video game award show.
3036180	3040220	And of course with the VGA's, there's a lot of, um, do you watch the VGA's?
3040220	3041220	Nope.
3041220	3042220	No.
3042220	3043220	Me neither.
3043220	3044220	Nope.
3044220	3045220	I just, I don't even have to ask Jamie.
3045220	3046220	I'll just watch the trailers afterwards.
3046220	3047220	Why am I going to waste?
3047220	3048220	Thank you.
3048220	3049220	Tiger call.
3049220	3050220	It was game of death.
3050220	3052740	Everything I've heard about the VGA's online was that they just like people felt their
3052740	3057020	IQs dropping rapidly as they were watching it as if anybody should be surprised.
3057020	3058020	It's spike.
3058020	3062940	No offense, but I mean they have game trailers, TV and game trailers did a lot of the, um,
3062940	3068740	you know, while they did all the trailer stuff, they have it hosted on their site, but it's
3068740	3073300	just like watching GTTV, you know, because it's really late and obviously I don't watch
3073300	3076860	it then, but I'll just catch it, you know, when the trailers come online the next day
3076860	3080060	and that's kind of what happened, um, for the most part.
3080060	3086100	Um, so one of the, of course announced, they tease and they announced a lot of games, um,
3086100	3087100	during the show.
3087100	3091580	So one of the games of course that's been in, you know, talked about for a while, Metal
3091580	3092580	Gear Solid Rising.
3092580	3099220	Well, now apparently Metal Gear Solid Rising is now Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance,
3099220	3105820	which almost sounds like a made up word, but I'm, it's, subtitles are cool.
3105820	3107880	It's vengeance, but revenge.
3107880	3109880	It's called a portmanteau.
3109880	3115280	Um, it's a combination of two words, duh.
3115280	3119540	Really why I think the reason they have to add the subtitle in the first place is because
3119540	3122860	it's gonna be a series, would be my guess.
3122860	3129300	But yeah, it's now actually being worked on by Platinum Games, of course the company responsible
3129300	3138300	for such wonderful things like Bayonetta or, um, Madworld or, um, oh what was the other
3138300	3139300	one?
3139300	3142940	Which, funny enough, coming off the Saints Row 3rd discussion is kind of in that same
3142940	3147740	bucket, where Bayonetta, again, sometimes you just want a big, stupid action movie,
3147740	3150420	and don't get me wrong, Bayonetta is great.
3150420	3154740	Bayonetta would make an awesome movie, and they have to.
3154740	3159340	If a Bayonetta movie ever happens, Joe Pesci better fucking be in that movie, because if
3159340	3160820	there's no Joe Pesci there.
3160820	3161820	He's almost too old.
3161820	3162820	They gotta hurry.
3162820	3163820	No, no, no.
3163820	3164820	He can do it.
3164820	3165820	No, they need Mark Shephard.
3165820	3166820	Who?
3166820	3167820	Mark Shephard.
3167820	3169140	Who's he?
3169140	3170140	You don't want Supernatural.
3170140	3171140	He plays Crowley.
3171140	3172140	Of course I don't.
3172140	3173140	He plays Crowley.
3173140	3174140	I'm a 30 year old male.
3174140	3177580	There's nothing in Supernatural for me.
3177580	3179820	He's just, he's just, he would be perfect for that row.
3179820	3180820	That role.
3180820	3181820	Fair enough.
3181820	3184340	Except Joe Pesci is that role.
3184340	3188020	Yeah, when I played the game, I thought Joe Pesci did, but if Joe Pesci was too old, then
3188020	3190380	I guess whoever Dark Tiger is talking about.
3190380	3192140	So but that'd be, that'd be awesome.
3192140	3197260	But anyways, yeah, it's not a lot of details are released about this yet, other than the
3197260	3201380	fact that, you know, New Studio is working on it now, and also it's supposed to take
3201380	3207460	place now in the time period after Metal Gear Solid 4, and I guess you're gonna be doing
3207460	3210420	like, mercenary work for different people and stuff.
3210420	3215020	I heard, um, it's getting a lot of flack from the Metal Gear community because it's not
3215020	3218680	a true quote unquote, Metal Gear game.
3218680	3223980	But I'm kind of like, well, I mean, they've done a lot of spinoff Metal Gear games.
3223980	3228760	And in my opinion, you know, I, I was kind of like, okay, whatever about this game.
3228760	3231820	But now that I hear that the Bayonetta folks are involved, I've perked up a little bit.
3231820	3235900	And I'm like, oh, they're serious about making an action Metal Gear game at this point.
3235900	3238140	Because, you know, Bayonetta was a heck of a game.
3238140	3242900	So I'm, I'm kind of interested in this, like way more than I was before, which is only
3242900	3243980	a little bit.
3243980	3246160	So you know, these things are going to happen.
3246160	3249580	Are you going to be completely denied a Metal Gear Solid 5 because of this game?
3249580	3250900	I don't think so.
3250900	3251900	It'll happen eventually.
3251900	3252900	Yeah.
3252900	3258780	So, um, yeah, I mean, come on, Kojima has even said that, you know, that they're going
3258780	3262380	to be doing a five.
3262380	3264220	He knows that people want a five.
3264220	3266660	Jack Deft in our chat room says, simply screw the fans.
3266660	3267660	Rising looks awesome.
3267660	3268860	I kind of agree.
3268860	3269860	Yeah.
3269860	3273180	If the fans of Metal Gear, whatever don't want it, then don't buy it.
3273180	3274180	More for me.
3274180	3275180	All right.
3275180	3279720	Well, we were talking about the new Xbox live dashboard that rolled out this week and you
3279720	3284460	might have not noticed this, but, uh, thankfully the internet was there to help you out.
3284460	3291560	Uh, the terms of service for Xbox have recently updated where now you will not be able to
3291560	3295420	essentially sue Microsoft as part of a class action agreement anymore.
3295420	3299180	You might remember this conversation from a few months ago when Sony did the same thing
3299180	3303100	in their terms of service, except there's kind of a difference in that is that, you
3303100	3308260	know, Sony had that whole hack thing that went on a while ago and like actually had
3308260	3312340	a reason that people might want to file a class action lawsuit, but Microsoft to our
3312340	3315180	knowledge hasn't had anything happen.
3315180	3320500	But then there's that part of me that goes, well, you know, people are getting, including
3320500	3325060	yours truly are getting their Xbox is hacked yet Microsoft keeps denying that something's
3325060	3326240	going on.
3326240	3331060	Are they getting us to all accept this agreement here so that in 45 days, uh, they're going
3331060	3334820	to announce it, you know, there was some type of breach or come be a little more forthright.
3334820	3335820	Well, what's going on?
3335820	3339180	Why everybody I know is getting their Xbox hacked that hasn't changed their password
3339180	3340740	recently.
3340740	3341740	So I don't know.
3341740	3347540	I mean, would you really like go to a court and actually start a lawsuit against them,
3347540	3354140	uh, or, well, I mean, I think if you're going to start a lawsuit against Microsoft, just
3354140	3355140	do it on your own.
3355140	3360700	I mean, I understand class action lawsuits are just so you, I think it's, it's a lot
3360700	3364020	of the class action lawsuits are started by these lawyers that just want to make some
3364020	3369100	money and you know, they just send out a blanket, noticed everybody and they're like, Hey, money's
3369100	3370100	coming your way.
3370100	3374020	And you're like, whoa, I don't have to do shit, you know, and I get free money.
3374020	3376540	I mean, I think that's what happened with like grand theft.
3376540	3380060	I don't even know if I ever got a check for grand theft auto.
3380060	3385300	I don't really care cause I still had grand theft auto and um, I wasn't gonna, you know,
3385300	3389620	San Andreas, the first issue with the hot coffee stuff in there, it's a cartridge as
3389620	3390620	I am now.
3390620	3396500	Um, I mean, I don't know, it's just kinda, it's kind of stupid.
3396500	3402540	It's like, yeah, I can get mad about it and stuff, but if, if it really was so bad to
3402540	3407380	where like I wanted to file a lawsuit, I would think that I would just do it on my own.
3407380	3409860	I mean, and just go through the whole arbitration thing.
3409860	3413140	And I kind of feel like a company, you know, should not be able to take that right away
3413140	3414460	from you.
3414460	3417140	If you really feel like you've been wronged, you should have the right to take them to
3417140	3418140	a legal court.
3418140	3419620	Like, isn't that granted in the constitution?
3419620	3424540	If you have a excuse or if you have a settlement that's more than $20 in value, you have a
3424540	3426300	right to a trial by jury or something like that.
3426300	3432660	I think that they're actually, um, they're going to be doing some sort of, I want to
3432660	3436940	say there has been some court cases or whatever, or places in the United States have found
3436940	3441700	that those arbitration things can't be upheld in court or something.
3441700	3442900	It's kind of like on both sides.
3442900	3448620	I think there's been some cases that have gone in the favor of the whole, um, arbitration
3448620	3452900	clauses and some against it and it's just which one has precedence or not.
3452900	3453900	All right.
3453900	3456100	Anyhow, um, I do want to point out, this is important.
3456100	3459940	You can't opt out of this by the way, if you want to keep using Xbox live, you cannot opt
3459940	3460940	out of this.
3460940	3463420	There was some rumor going around at first that it kind of had the postcard thing going
3463420	3469940	on, but actually what's going on is that you can reject future changes to the arbitration
3469940	3472580	agreement, but you cannot decline this one.
3472580	3476840	So if you don't like it, you got to stop using Xbox live and I got to get this out here.
3476840	3481560	This is the one other big thing I do not like about this is that because I can't opt out
3481560	3486980	to these changes or what have you, that's kind of shady to me because of the fact that
3486980	3489680	my Xbox live is already paid for in advance.
3489680	3494180	So they're making changes to the agreement midway through is kind of, it's just, it's
3494180	3495180	just shady.
3495180	3497780	I mean, am I ever going to Sue Microsoft?
3497780	3498780	Probably not.
3498780	3502260	You know, it would be nice to know that if I had a reason, I'm sure that they've got
3502260	3507140	it in the small text or whatever before when you're paying for your, your life that we
3507140	3511180	can change this at any time, you know, and without notice and blah, blah, blah.
3511180	3514620	You know, they have their lawyers covering their asses for this shit.
3514620	3517420	Some, some States are taking action against these things too.
3517420	3521180	So you know, maybe a matter of time before these types of agreements are illegal anyway.
3521180	3522180	But I mean, look at it this way.
3522180	3528900	I mean, honestly, I mean, look at, are any of you really gonna just like go after Microsoft
3528900	3530480	and actually file a lawsuit?
3530480	3535260	I think not made for the most case if, if it really, if they do something to you that
3535260	3538420	really pisses you off, here's how you take care of it later on.
3538420	3540060	You don't buy their next console.
3540060	3545340	You just say whatever, if you smear them on the Internet like everyone else does or yes,
3545340	3546340	mirror them on the Internet.
3546340	3551740	Well, I'm just like, seriously, if it's, if it's so bad that you actually have to go and
3551740	3557380	file a lawsuit against, you know, whatever company maybe Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, whoever.
3557380	3561820	If it's, they're pissing you off that much that you just like, I gotta go file a lawsuit
3561820	3565220	against them, then just don't buy their product.
3565220	3566220	That's true.
3566220	3567220	Kick them where it counts in the wallet.
3567220	3572140	I mean, cause a lot of people may go that route if there's something like, you know,
3572140	3575940	if it comes out 45 days later, they're like, oh, you had to sign this arbitration clause
3575940	3580380	and there's been this massive leak that you've been, you know, covering up.
3580380	3582060	Trust me, they'll get it in the end.
3582060	3585260	You know, someone will investigate and say, hey, what the fuck?
3585260	3588300	You know, why are you having these people sign this?
3588300	3590740	Oh, because you knew that you were going to get sued.
3590740	3596900	So I mean, I mean just like, you know, people were worried about buying the 360 back when
3596900	3599380	the whole red rain, you know, was going around.
3599380	3603140	By the way, I was at a target the X, you get the other day with a new Xbox, one of the
3603140	3608420	newer ones, red ring to e 68, not written, not red dot, excuse me, the red dot of death
3608420	3610780	with an e 68 error.
3610780	3611780	Hilarious.
3611780	3613260	Problem's still not gone.
3613260	3614260	Just saying.
3614260	3615260	Yeah.
3615260	3616260	All right.
3616260	3617260	Anyhow.
3617260	3619480	So, um, there you have it.
3619480	3621780	Take it or leave it.
3621780	3625020	Get off Xbox live, I guess if you don't like it at this point, but I don't know at the
3625020	3629780	end of the day, if I get pissed off enough, that agreement ain't going to stop me.
3629780	3630780	And I don't think it can.
3630780	3631780	I think that's only about class.
3631780	3632780	That's a class action waiver.
3632780	3635820	If me as an individual wants to sue Microsoft, I believe I can still do that.
3635820	3640520	I don't think anybody can take that right away, but they're just going to make it very
3640520	3641740	fucking difficult to do that.
3641740	3642740	Of course.
3642740	3643740	They just keep up in the end.
3643740	3649800	You know, it's, it's just a, another case of the big guys, big companies trying to,
3649800	3653540	you know, corporations or people.
3653540	3656500	Anyway, all right, let's move on.
3656500	3659780	Well, um, Epic, we know Epic, don't we?
3659780	3664980	Well, um, they've announced a game for the Vita, the PS Vita, sorry.
3664980	3672660	Um, and it is a zombie game called Fortnite, F O R T N I T E. And, um, there wasn't actually
3672660	3677620	any gameplay shown in the trailer, but it said that it should all the characters picking
3677620	3683040	up trash and scrap metal and bringing it back and then the zombies show up.
3683040	3688700	So basically from what I understand is that it's preparing for a zombie assault and then
3688700	3691040	the zombies come and you survive the assault.
3691040	3695900	That would be awesome if it was like junkyard wars meets a zombie apocalypse.
3695900	3700460	Well there's not too much else about it, like, other than, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean Vita,
3700460	3706060	I just saw Vita add my bad, but it doesn't say exactly, you know, when or what or that
3706060	3711620	it's going to be out, but, um, there should be more information soon.
3711620	3714140	I don't know why, I'm sorry that I said it was on the Vita.
3714140	3717820	More info in a Fortnite.
3717820	3724940	Um, so there was another teaser trailer, in fact it was one that we were kind of, BioWare
3724940	3728900	was doing a new game and everyone was like, oh, it looks like, you know, it's going to
3728900	3733020	be a new Command & Conquer game because of all these, you know, website trademarks being
3733020	3737580	registered and stuff like that, and yes, it ended up being a new Command & Conquer game.
3737580	3742420	Bye BioWare, can Command & Conquer Generals 2, I almost forgot that there was a Command
3742420	3749580	& Conquer Generals game, but it's set to come out 2013 on PC exclusively.
3749580	3756300	It's going to be using the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which you may remember from Battlefield 3,
3756300	3762100	which looked pretty awesome, so, um, very cool to check it out.
3762100	3766780	I did not play the first Generals game, but I know it was a little bit different than
3766780	3771340	the regular Command & Conquer game because I believe it was one where you're actually,
3771340	3775540	um, if I remember correctly, you're actually playing as one of the troops kind of on the
3775540	3781980	ground and you can still kind of, uh, control different things as well, but it's not just
3781980	3786060	like an RTS game, like before, if I remember correctly.
3786060	3787060	I could be wrong though.
3787060	3791220	There might have been another Command & Conquer game that was also along the lines of that.
3791220	3796380	It's very interesting to me that they are going PC only with this, especially with,
3796380	3799840	you know, some developers saying we'll never make PC games again.
3799840	3804500	I think it's just mainly because Command & Conquer is not very popular on consoles actually.
3804500	3807100	It's just really more of a PC game.
3807100	3810660	It's just, it hasn't done well when they've brought the last few to consoles.
3810660	3811660	Makes sense.
3811660	3812660	So, unfortunately.
3812660	3817140	It's like Civilization, maybe, that it doesn't, well, I was going to say it doesn't translate
3817140	3822000	well to consoles, but I actually think that Civilization Revolution game was pretty good
3822000	3827320	for a console game, but it was a scaled-back experience, so it wasn't the same Civilization
3827320	3828320	you really get on PC.
3828320	3833020	It would be a good game, I think, if, I mean, RTS-wise, it would be a good game for like
3833020	3834020	the Wii U.
3834020	3838500	I mean, I think RTS games translate well for the Wii U with a, you know, a touch screen
3838500	3840780	and you can move stuff around that way.
3840780	3845180	That'd be kind of cool, because it'd be like playing, uh, what was it, uh, there was a
3845180	3855660	Tom Clancy's, um, the Tom Clancy game, not End of War, but it was, uh, Rooz, where they
3855660	3860980	had that actually playable on Microsoft Surface systems, and you could, you know, mess around
3860980	3861980	with that.
3861980	3865540	It'd be kind of similar to playing it on, like, a Surface or something, but you'd be
3865540	3867820	playing it with the tablet, if you will.
3867820	3872580	So I could see RTS is coming over there, but, yeah, it's just going to be right now PC only,
3872580	3876660	and, you know, if it does well on PC, they may decide to try it again on consoles, but
3876660	3878140	as of right now, it's just PC.
3878140	3881700	And 2013 is when you can expect that.
3881700	3884180	As a Command & Conquer fan, are you, uh, going to pick this up?
3884180	3888700	No, I haven't played Command & Conquer, it's the first Red Alert game.
3888700	3891340	I mean, that's how long ago it's been.
3891340	3892700	That is a long time ago.
3892700	3893700	So.
3893700	3894700	Alright.
3894700	3898940	Well, um, going to one more game that was announced at the, um, you know, little thingy
3898940	3904260	they did last night was, uh, a game called The Last of Us, uh, which is by Naughty Dog.
3904260	3907420	Those are the folks behind Uncharted and, like, Crash Bandicoot way back in the day.
3907420	3911140	Um, so this is a game that's coming out, I believe they said it's exclusive for the PlayStation
3911140	3916060	3, and, uh, in the trailer, it even said that the trailer was, like, a live feed from a
3916060	3919020	PlayStation 3, so I guess that's kind of neat.
3919020	3923900	Um, and it's, I don't know what, like, kind of game they're going for, if it was, like,
3923900	3926820	survivable horror or action, I think it's kind of supposed to be, like, a hybrid of
3926820	3927820	the two.
3927820	3930340	But for me, the trailer, and I'm going to play a little bit of the trailer here so at
3930340	3933820	least you get some of the audio, the trailer to me looked a little bit, like, kind of like
3933820	3938900	a mixture between, what's that Will Smith movie where he's alone in the world after
3938900	3940300	the outbreak?
3940300	3941300	I am Legend.
3941300	3942300	Thank you.
3942300	3946900	It looks like I am Legend mixed with, like, a father-daughter bonding thing going on here.
3946900	3949220	Oh, daddy, you killed him just fine.
3949220	3952460	Well, she kills one here later on in the trailer, so.
3952460	3954420	There's kind of one coming up here.
3954420	3956740	I'm proud of you, babies.
3956740	3960580	And she looks like the girl from Juno, which is a little weird to me, so, like, is it just
3960580	3961580	me?
3961580	3964180	But you know the premise of this, right?
3964180	3969380	It's that, um, bacteria, that fungus or whatever that they have, like, in, I think it's in
3969380	3974460	the rainforest or whatever, that takes over actual, like, insects or whatever and infects
3974460	3980860	their brain and then they eventually, um, I think die, it, like, controls their body
3980860	3981860	almost.
3981860	3982860	Wasn't that the plot to I am Legend?
3982860	3984740	No, I am Legend was vampires.
3984740	3986540	Or was that 28 Days Later?
3986540	3987540	28 Days Later was zombies.
3987540	3988540	Okay.
3988540	3990740	I'm sorry, it was a disease, but it, you know, it's zombies.
3990740	3998780	Okay, okay, so it's 28 Days Later mixed with I am Legend mixed with, mixed with Juno.
3998780	3999780	I guess really the best I can tell you.
3999780	4001780	I guess, oh, the graphics look good.
4001780	4006860	If that really is real-time rendering or whatever, then it looks really good.
4006860	4009740	Now, just because it's coming from a PlayStation 3 system, I kind of go, well, it could be
4009740	4011020	just a Blu-ray movie.
4011020	4014460	But if that is, like, really in real-time being developed by the engine, that's, I gotta
4014460	4015820	say, a good-looking game.
4015820	4019660	Uncharted 3 is a pretty sexy-looking game, so I could believe that that's real-time.
4019660	4020660	Okay, point taken.
4020660	4023940	So, and this is, by the way, just referencing Bobby's show earlier this evening.
4023940	4029260	This is why he calls the game The Last of Us, because OFIS is all one word looking there.
4029260	4030260	No, it's not.
4030260	4036460	Yeah, I, yes, I can see that the kerning between the F and the U, speaking of F-U, speaking
4036460	4037460	of F-U.
4037460	4042740	You know what, but you did use, you did use the right term.
4042740	4046860	I can, once in a while, Dark Soccer, this might shock you, once in a while, I have a
4046860	4048220	smart moment.
4048220	4049620	You know what I would have done, though?
4049620	4050620	What?
4050620	4053260	I would have moved the Us, actually, I would have kerned it a little bit differently so
4053260	4056460	that the space with the T and the S would have been exactly the same, and that would
4056460	4057620	have looked really hot.
4057620	4058620	Hey, guess what?
4058620	4059620	Hire me, people!
4059620	4061620	I'm a good designer, really.
4061620	4062620	Hey, guess what?
4062620	4063620	What?
4063620	4064620	No one kerr.
4064620	4065620	All right.
4065620	4066620	You know what, you know what I would have done differently?
4066620	4070460	I would have called it The Happening 2, because that's really kind of what it is.
4070460	4073380	It's plants taking over people.
4073380	4074380	Plants versus zombies!
4074380	4079060	Actually, you know what, The Happening, The Happening, if it was the fungus or whatever
4079060	4086820	that makes people kill themselves, much like, you know, that fungus that kills ants or whatever,
4086820	4094060	if it was like that instead of like, oh, it's leaf pollen that makes people murder things,
4094060	4095620	that would have been a little bit more realistic.
4095620	4097420	Wait, I just said more realistic?
4097420	4098420	I'm sorry.
4098420	4100780	It's a nice Shyamalan movie, it's not realistic at all.
4100780	4105860	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says, every game could be better with Tim
4105860	4106860	Curry in it.
4106860	4109460	I don't know where that comes from, but yes, that would be absolutely true.
4109460	4113640	In fact, if Pennywise the Clown was in this game, it would be the scariest video game
4113640	4115340	of all time, quite possibly.
4115340	4116340	You know what?
4116340	4119500	Didn't we do a list list on this, and it was determined that Pennywise the Clown was like
4119500	4122140	the number one character we want to see in a game?
4122140	4125420	I didn't know LR Historian stat.
4125420	4126420	Didn't we determine-
4126420	4130380	That would guarantee I wouldn't play it, you know.
4130380	4134540	As much as I love Tim Curry, clowns freak me the fuck out.
4134540	4135540	That just means he's a good actor.
4135540	4136540	I mean, think about it.
4136540	4137540	No, no, no, no, no.
4137540	4138540	Some of the scariest characters-
4138540	4140380	Tim Curry, I'm fine with.
4140380	4142940	Some of the scariest characters from your childhood were Tim Curry.
4142940	4143940	Think about it.
4143940	4151460	Pennywise the Clown, Darkness from Legend, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Rooster from Annie.
4151460	4155660	I mean, he's a great villain.
4155660	4156660	Tim Curry does need to be in St. Croix.
4156660	4160900	But he was also in the Littlest Witch movie, and I'm sorry, not even Tim Curry could save
4160900	4161900	that movie.
4161900	4164180	It was bad.
4164180	4167740	I vote, since you know Saints Row, the character can be anyway.
4167740	4170660	I vote that he should be the head of the gang in the Saints Row movie.
4170660	4171660	What, Tim Curry?
4171660	4172660	Tim Curry.
4172660	4173660	Absolutely.
4173660	4174660	That would be awesome.
4174660	4175660	That's right.
4175660	4177260	It would be so random.
4177260	4180740	As part of the marketing pun, they should never show who the leader of the gang is in
4180740	4182100	any of the trailers.
4182100	4184640	Just leave it up to the movie, and people find out it's Tim Curry.
4184640	4185640	You know what?
4185640	4189740	It's like the snazziest suit and everything, except they finally show his feet and its
4189740	4190740	nine-inch heels.
4190740	4191740	All right.
4191740	4192740	Look.
4192740	4193740	Moving on.
4193740	4194740	We got another story.
4194740	4196220	I do want to tease this, though, because we're getting towards the end of part eight, and
4196220	4197420	this is important.
4197420	4201260	If you have Mario Kart 7, get your 3DS out.
4201260	4205540	Go to twitter.com slash O-L-R, or maybe somebody in chat will yell it out again.
4205540	4207900	Add us to your community list, because we're going to try.
4207900	4210620	I don't know how this is going to work, because I haven't played games online, but we're going
4210620	4211620	to try during the break.
4211620	4214780	I'm going to try and do a community race with you guys during tonight's break.
4214780	4218860	So get out your 3DS, get on Mario Kart 7, and add the oil army community so you're ready
4218860	4221660	to go in about 20 minutes when we get there.
4221660	4222660	All right.
4222660	4224700	So meantime, Dark Soccer's got some more news for us.
4224700	4225700	Right, Dark Soccer?
4225700	4226700	Yes.
4226700	4227700	About the Doctor.
4227700	4230380	There's a Doctor Who game coming out.
4230380	4237900	BBC let out a leak of the Doctor Who game for PS3, Vita, and PC.
4237900	4240080	I'm totally going to play the hell out of this.
4240080	4243580	It's called Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock.
4243580	4249300	And you can basically play as the Doctor and River Song, and they go through the universe
4249300	4254860	in different time periods, and hopefully there are some Cybermen and Daleks in it, because
4254860	4259580	it's not a Doctor Who thing without Cybermen and Daleks eventually showing up in some form
4259580	4260580	or another.
4260580	4265020	Actually, I bet it's going to have the silence in it, even though the silence did get totally...
4265020	4266020	Oh!
4266020	4269100	Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
4269100	4271420	But it's being built by Supermassive Games.
4271420	4276740	They're the ones who did Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves for LittleBigPlanet 2.
4276740	4280940	And if there's a PC version, I really hope they do it for Steam.
4280940	4287220	Wouldn't that be awesome if they had a LittleBigPlanet 2 download content pack that was the Doctor?
4287220	4288220	That would be awesome.
4288220	4294860	But then he'd just walk around Sonic screwdriver-ing everything and doing his timey-wimey stuff.
4294860	4295860	I want a TARDIS.
4295860	4296860	I have a TARDIS.
4296860	4297860	Nice.
4297860	4299460	I totally want this game.
4299460	4303380	You know, one of our listeners in the UK sent me a Doctor Who game a while back.
4303380	4304380	Yeah, I remember that.
4304380	4307300	And it wasn't very good, from what I remember.
4307300	4311140	It was Top Trumps or whatever the card game is.
4311140	4312140	It was pretty fun.
4312140	4313460	It actually was really fun.
4313460	4316180	I had no idea how to play when I first played it.
4316180	4319820	It was so foreign.
4319820	4322820	It was so, so un-American.
4322820	4325260	No, I'm kidding.
4325260	4329580	It was actually pretty fun, but it had Martha in it, so I had to gag a little bit.
4329580	4332780	Alright, we're going to travel around the world and check out release dates.
4332780	4336980	Although we're getting to that time of year where if it was going to come out, it's out.
4336980	4341700	But there's some coal at the bottom of the stocking if you dig enough, right, Loki?
4341700	4345620	Yeah, let me see if I can do this all in one breath, because it's very, very small.
4345620	4347900	Alright, here we go.
4347900	4348900	US States, here we go.
4348900	4353860	Alright, we have Outdoor Unleashed Alaska and Africa on the 3DS, Dr. Lork and the Forgotten
4353860	4358260	Knights on the 3DS, and I Heart Geeks on the Nintendo DS.
4358260	4361380	Well this is a big week for DS people.
4361380	4362500	That was it.
4362500	4363740	What's I Heart Geeks?
4363740	4369580	I Heart Geeks is something that's from, remember Mark Echo and the crappy Getting Up game?
4369580	4372660	Well Mark Echo is now providing some stuff for this I Heart Geeks.
4372660	4376220	It's like, I think, The Incredible Machine or something.
4376220	4377780	That was an epic game on the end.
4377780	4379900	Yeah, yeah, it was an epic game.
4379900	4381740	They kind of beat it into the ground.
4381740	4383980	It's just not quite as cool anymore.
4383980	4384980	I like the box art.
4384980	4385980	It's cute.
4385980	4391420	I don't even think they even have a trailer for it, but yeah, it's got some artwork by
4391420	4393740	Mark Echo and that's about it.
4393740	4397220	Alright, well let's go over to Japan and check out some release dates in Japan.
4397220	4398220	I gotta say it's-
4398220	4401060	Oh, and I'm sorry, the Oregon Trail 3DS, because I got delayed a week.
4401060	4402060	Ha, you screwed up.
4402060	4403060	That wasn't one breath.
4403060	4404060	Alright.
4404060	4405060	Well I said it last week, so that's alright.
4405060	4408940	I gotta say, for those of you that like to import your games, especially, we'll get to
4408940	4414020	PlayStation 3 in a minute here, because PS3 is a region free and all, it's a much more
4414020	4416740	exciting week, if you can understand Japanese, because I'll tell you what.
4416740	4418420	On the Xbox, we'll start with 360.
4418420	4422900	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Final Fantasy XIII-2, I think there's a few people
4422900	4424020	excited about that.
4424020	4426080	That comes out on the 15th of December.
4426080	4431060	Also this week in Japan, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend comes out this week in Japan,
4431060	4435020	and Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, if you're into those fitness games.
4435020	4440020	Final Fantasy XIII-2 here in the States will be coming out on the 31st of January, and-
4440020	4441860	Not a bad delay, all things considered.
4441860	4450900	And BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend would be on the 22nd, I believe, of February.
4450900	4454180	Now PlayStation 3 in Japan has some of the similar stuff.
4454180	4459060	They also have Final Fantasy XIII-2, but they're also getting a whole darn console in the Final
4459060	4464200	Fantasy XIII-2 style, which is weird to me, because they did one for Final Fantasy XIII,
4464200	4467180	and I would think any Final Fantasy person probably already bought it back then, but
4467180	4468180	maybe I don't know.
4468180	4472900	I guess this one's a slim, so maybe, I don't know, you need a twin-Z for your other PlayStation
4472900	4473900	3?
4473900	4474900	I don't know.
4474900	4475900	But there's that this week to look forward to.
4475900	4479060	There's also a couple other games, BlazBlue on the 17th as well, but there's a couple
4479060	4482740	other games as well coming out specifically on the PlayStation 3.
4482740	4489380	One of them is called Rayofu no Melt comes out this week, and that's an adventure game
4489380	4491860	that stars anime chicks, so there you go.
4491860	4498940	And then also Umeneko no Naku Koro ni San Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasuyoku comes out
4498940	4503420	this week, which is, I'm reading the description here.
4503420	4505540	Take another step closer to the truth.
4505540	4512100	The game Battler plays with Beatrice is coming to an end in Shinzutsu Tu Gensou no Yasukyo.
4512100	4516340	I'm trying to think if this is something that exists here.
4516340	4520880	Oh, it's another racing game, another sim.
4520880	4526900	That may very well be, oh what the hell, they just announced a sequel to it too, it was
4526900	4529420	a PlayStation 3 only game.
4529420	4532560	There's chocolate cake involved, I can see from one of the screenshots here.
4532560	4533560	Chocolate cake.
4533560	4537340	This game actually has cake, unlike Portal.
4537340	4541940	Well it's described as having vivid character illustrations and atmospheric music, soundtrack
4541940	4545620	with 80 pieces of music in the game.
4545620	4546660	So there you go.
4546660	4549180	That is coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4549180	4551060	So a more exciting week over Japan.
4551060	4553940	I thought it was the game with the Soul Breed system, I can't remember what the hell it
4553940	4554940	was called though.
4554940	4558180	I had just set up the item too this week, but yet that really stuck in my mind.
4558180	4559180	Can I get this out though?
4559180	4563020	Do you know what else makes this week exciting in Japan, way more exciting than here?
4563020	4566140	The PlayStation Vita is unleashed on December 17th.
4566140	4570420	So before we have our next show, the Vita will be out somewhere in the world.
4570420	4573300	And of course, lots and lots and lots of launch games.
4573300	4576980	I don't really have time to read through them all, but the Vita and all its games are out
4576980	4577980	this week.
4577980	4581300	It's called The Augurist War, but I don't know if that was a record of The Augurist
4581300	4585500	War 2, which is technically the third game, because the second game was a prequel.
4585500	4588820	Alright, I'll tell you some of the games that are jumping out at me on the Vita.
4588820	4594180	BlazBlue has a Vita port as well, which would explain why the release of the console ones
4594180	4595580	has staggered a little bit.
4595580	4597580	Katamari Damacy has a Vita game coming out.
4597580	4602660	That I would recommend at launch because it's cheaper and it also has new levels and apparently
4602660	4604060	it's pre-fun play.
4604060	4605980	Michael Jackson, the experience.
4605980	4608540	Not getting that over here at launch.
4608540	4609540	Ridge Racer.
4609540	4611420	Don't buy that.
4611420	4613100	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
4613100	4614780	That's supposed to be pretty good.
4614780	4616500	And Uncharted Golden Abyss.
4616500	4617780	That's obviously really good.
4617780	4622220	So Vita's got a really strong launch in Japan, so it'll be interesting to see how...
4622220	4623780	Even stronger over here too.
4623780	4627020	Also a Squeenix game called Lord of Apocalypse.
4627020	4628020	But that's like...
4628020	4629440	That's supposed to be awesome looking.
4629440	4633980	That's like half the games coming out, so it's gonna be interesting to see how the launch
4633980	4638900	compares to the 3DS launch when 3DS didn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's a
4638900	4640580	lot stronger now.
4640580	4642940	The PSP is not forgotten.
4642940	4645180	Just for Dark Sakura, they are releasing on the PSP.
4645180	4646180	It's actually the Dark Sakura edition.
4646180	4647260	No, I'm just kidding.
4647260	4651660	But it is Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd, low price edition.
4651660	4652660	Yay!
4652660	4654660	Budget bin edition.
4654660	4655660	Woohoo!
4655660	4656660	Yay!
4656660	4663220	Trying to look at the Nintendo systems real quick, seeing what the 3DS is countering with
4663220	4665220	this week against the Vita.
4665220	4669100	Puyo Puyo Anniversary Pins Collection.
4669100	4673800	And Inazuma Eleven Go, dark version and shine version.
4673800	4675460	Both are out this week.
4675460	4677940	From level 5.
4677940	4680140	So that's a sports game.
4680140	4681140	Puyo Puyo.
4681140	4682140	Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.
4682140	4684500	So a very busy week in Japan.
4684500	4686980	Not so busy in the UK.
4686980	4690260	On the 12th we have Gears of War 3 Ram Shadow.
4690260	4694980	On the 13th is Flat Out 3 Chaos and Destruction for PC.
4694980	4700900	And also on the PC on the 15th of December is X3 Albion Prelude.
4700900	4701900	That's about it.
4701900	4707660	I can't tell you what's coming out the week after that though.
4707660	4708660	The Old Republic.
4708660	4713660	Alright, we're going to get into some more news here in just a minute.
4713660	4716740	We're actually, just for the podcast folks, we lost our live feed.
4716740	4717740	Winamp crashed.
4717740	4719780	That happens a lot lately around here.
4719780	4721300	I can't figure out what's going on.
4721300	4722940	If it's not Comcast, it's Winamp.
4722940	4723940	I think they're in Kahoots.
4723940	4725940	If you needed to upgrade a copy of Winamp.
4725940	4727660	They're in Kahoots!
4727660	4728660	Perhaps.
4728660	4729660	I love that word Kahoots.
4729660	4731340	Are they making new versions of Winamp?
4731340	4733340	I think they do still make versions of Winamp.
4733340	4734900	But anyway, we should be reconnected.
4734900	4738900	So apologies to the live listeners and hopefully we didn't lose you guys during the week.
4738900	4740260	I don't know how long we were down.
4740260	4744720	I was so into reading those Japanese releases that Winamp could have been down for 5 minutes
4744720	4745720	for all I know.
4745720	4746720	So I apologize.
4746720	4750020	I was really looking at it with such intensity on his face that I thought he was going to
4750020	4751020	pop a vein.
4751020	4752020	Seriously?
4752020	4753020	Alright, wow.
4753020	4755740	I think it was down for some time.
4755740	4756740	Sorry guys.
4756740	4757740	Rob Vail.
4757740	4758740	Fired.
4758740	4760740	No, you're not fired.
4760740	4762060	Or you're rehired.
4762060	4763980	I could fire you once and then rehire you.
4763980	4764980	Alright.
4764980	4768020	Let's move on with some more gaming news now that we have our live listeners back.
4768020	4769580	Sorry, you just missed the release dates.
4769580	4770580	Sorry.
4770580	4772420	Yeah, there's like not much coming out.
4772420	4774060	No, there's a shit ton in Japan.
4774060	4777300	U.S. and U.S., U.K., not so much.
4777300	4781300	Japan has the Vita release and a bunch of other stuff to go with it.
4781300	4785540	People in Japan, send Jamie a Vita so she can review it and talk about you.
4785540	4789540	I thought about buying a Vita from Japan and I thought it was $600 and I'm like, fuck that.
4789540	4790540	No way.
4790540	4791540	Sorry.
4791540	4794340	Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Classic Game of the Week
4794340	4797380	and of course our Mario competition soon.
4797380	4804020	So Capcom is actually bringing over some Japanese indie games to PC for North America and Europe.
4804020	4807420	And they're going to be doing some cool stuff.
4807420	4814860	This is with a partnership deal with New Media, NYU, not new.
4814860	4821120	And I guess they're going to be doing some neat, like a lot of, they call them retro
4821120	4824500	chic arcade shooters.
4824500	4833180	For example, they've got, looks like Satsa, Satsa, I can't even pronounce this, Sat-tazu-ts,
4833180	4834180	yes.
4834180	4843340	That's going to be coming out, that's available I guess as well on December 20th via Steam
4843340	4849620	direct to drive Gamers Gate and other major digital distribution services for $6.
4849620	4858180	And then coming early 2012, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, Ether Vapor remaster, Fighting
4858180	4866100	Fairy, Exceed 2nd, Vampire Rex, and Exceed 3rd, Jade Penetrate Black Package.
4866100	4868220	I'd play Fighting Fairy.
4868220	4873980	And I'm going to take a wild guess and say those probably the last two there are shmup
4873980	4879500	games because that kind of sounds very, you're a shmup, shmuppy.
4879500	4882420	And yes, I would be accurate on that.
4882420	4889740	Probably very complicated titles and Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, if that's a shmup I'm
4889740	4890740	going to laugh.
4890740	4891740	Nope, of course not.
4891740	4894100	But that would be a funny name for a shmup.
4894100	4895820	Fighting Fairy is the best name ever.
4895820	4898860	It makes me want to kill Navi.
4898860	4900980	Hey, listen, Squish.
4900980	4906260	Yeah, Fighting Fairy is a fighting game, so they look pretty cool.
4906260	4910260	So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing some of that stuff localized.
4910260	4914140	I mean, it's nice to see that they're bringing that over, even though they don't want to
4914140	4918220	do a Mega Man game, but whatever.
4918220	4922180	All right, moving on to just one more story here and then we're going to get to the classic
4922180	4923180	game of the week.
4923180	4928820	But first I want to talk about dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, OMG, a Microsoft
4928820	4933100	app on an iOS device that makes it look like a Windows Phone, sort of.
4933100	4934100	What?
4934100	4935100	Here's the deal.
4935100	4938640	My Xbox Live is a new app that is on the iOS App Store and it's a way for you to integrate
4938640	4943180	with the new Xbox, you know, um, and this is nice because there were some like fan created
4943180	4946460	apps or whatever, or unofficial apps that were decent.
4946460	4950060	But now we have something kind of official and you can get on this app and you can see
4950060	4953220	what friends are online, what they're playing, compare achievements, all that stuff.
4953220	4956180	And what I think is kind of neat, you can send messages.
4956180	4958620	You can actually send messages through the app to people on their Xbox.
4958620	4959920	Can you play with your avatar?
4959920	4963700	So like if Loki isn't listening, I think you can actually customize your avatar.
4963700	4964760	You can, you can.
4964760	4969720	So like if Loki isn't listening to you because he's too busy throwing carrots in Skyrim,
4969720	4973340	you can actually pop it up on his screen through your iOS phone.
4973340	4975340	Stop throwing carrots, dammit!
4975340	4978420	Stop the carrots and pick up the phone and call me or something, you know, something
4978420	4979420	like that.
4979420	4980540	So that's pretty cool.
4980540	4983380	And you can also delete friends from your phone.
4983380	4984380	Woohoo!
4984380	4985380	Yay!
4985380	4987420	All these people I don't know.
4987420	4988420	The app is free.
4988420	4989420	So there you go.
4989420	4991160	I should go download it now.
4991160	4993540	And the app is also available on Windows Phones.
4993540	4995740	Of course, of course.
4995740	4998980	But it was just kind of funny that it made its way to the iOS app as well.
4998980	5003100	And I believe the Windows Phone app will do slightly more.
5003100	5006580	I think you can actually look through the catalogs of movies and apps and all that.
5006580	5009540	You can queue up movies and control your Xbox using that.
5009540	5013020	Right, which you can't do on iOS because if you sell things to the iOS store then Apple
5013020	5015780	gets a cut and Microsoft's not having any of that.
5015780	5018660	So you can only do that on the Windows Phone.
5018660	5021260	Well no, I wouldn't see that they wouldn't be able to do that.
5021260	5025180	It's just they probably, it's a little harder to, well actually I don't understand why it
5025180	5027700	wouldn't be harder for them to do that.
5027700	5029620	Because you can do that with like Comcast and stuff.
5029620	5033940	I know I could, before when I was paying for like a DVR box and stuff like that, you could
5033940	5037820	control the DVR using the iOS app.
5037820	5041380	Now as Bobby Blackwolf says in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrager.com, Blackwolf says
5041380	5043740	it's sluggish even on an iPad 2.
5043740	5044740	Makes me sad.
5044740	5045740	No voice messages.
5045740	5046740	That's true.
5046740	5047740	You can't do voice messages.
5047740	5052420	I do realize though, like I just realized this recently, but the Kinect wires your whole
5052420	5054400	damn room as a microphone.
5054400	5057180	Like I can't find the charger for my little wireless headset.
5057180	5061500	I had it for my Xbox so I have like no headset right now because the cat ate Alan's.
5061500	5065400	So all we have is the Kinect and like when I'm playing apples to apples I can just talk
5065400	5066400	to people.
5066400	5067400	You can't find the charger?
5067400	5068400	My normal voice, yeah.
5068400	5069400	I can probably find it.
5069400	5070400	I think I have a spare headset too.
5070400	5071400	Woohoo!
5071400	5072400	That'd be awesome if you have it.
5072400	5073400	It's a crappy headset.
5073400	5074400	I don't like those wireless ones.
5074400	5076500	The cats apparently live on a diet of headphone wires and treats.
5076500	5077500	Don't they?
5077500	5080220	They do it when we go to Disneyland and don't take them.
5080220	5081580	That's how they act out.
5081580	5083940	My cat likes to eat our artificial tree.
5083940	5085980	She's just gnawing on it with the cords and stuff.
5085980	5090820	It reminds me of like Christmas vacation with the cat chewing on the cords and plugging
5090820	5091820	in.
5091820	5092820	Hey, the Christmas tree's off.
5092820	5097100	I don't think they chewed on anything when I cats sat last time.
5097100	5099300	Well that's because you were coming over and giving them pettings.
5099300	5100300	Yeah.
5100300	5101300	And they were like, person, meow, meow, meow.
5101300	5102940	Now they're being butt heads to me again.
5102940	5105860	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
5105860	5110820	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to take a stroll down memory lane.
5110820	5115420	Dark Soccer will dive into the vault headfirst and find a classic game that she says, hey,
5115420	5121340	listen up you kids with your Skyrim and your I can't believe it's not Microsoft on an Apple
5121340	5122340	phone stuffs.
5122340	5124260	You need to go back to simpler times.
5124260	5126460	We didn't have no cell phone to manage friends lists.
5126460	5128420	We didn't have friends lists.
5128420	5130260	Yeah, we just had friends.
5130260	5131740	Back in the days of the Genesis.
5131740	5133460	Yeah, we didn't play online.
5133460	5135980	We just had people at our house and they ate all our pizza.
5135980	5139940	So Dark Soccer, if the kids today want to know what life was like back then, she's going
5139940	5142900	to hand pick one game that she thinks she kids should play.
5142900	5144940	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5144940	5148580	The classic game of the week is Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Say Saturn.
5148580	5149580	Yay.
5149580	5152740	Now, am I playing the intro here or just the...
5152740	5153740	Okay, play, okay.
5153740	5154740	This is what I have to do first.
5154740	5155740	Okay.
5155740	5156920	The game came out in Japan.
5156920	5161660	It was based off of, it was based off the anime and they had to redo the intro.
5161660	5164820	So I want people to hear the difference between the two versions.
5164820	5165820	Okay.
5165820	5166820	So play the English one first.
5166820	5167820	Okay.
5167820	5172980	Here is the English intro to Magic Knight Ray Earth.
5172980	5183620	A bold, daring dream built of hope, found my chance into the deep end.
5183620	5184620	Okay.
5184620	5185620	That's enough.
5185620	5186620	Play the Japanese one now.
5186620	5187620	My music's going to make me poop.
5187620	5192220	All right, here's the Japanese one.
5192220	5197100	Come on.
5197100	5203540	Here you go.
5203540	5206380	Isn't that better?
5206380	5207380	Not really.
5207380	5209780	She sounds more like a cat in that one.
5209780	5211260	Well, okay.
5211260	5215780	But anyway, they had an even worse version and people complained so much.
5215780	5216780	What, the German one?
5216780	5217780	No.
5217780	5220700	Just play music from the game.
5220700	5221700	All right, fine.
5221700	5223500	Here is music from Magic Knight Ray Earth.
5223500	5227100	Well, anyway, there was a big anime series called Magic Knight Ray Earth, which was really
5227100	5228100	awesome.
5228100	5233580	The game was one of the pet projects of working designs and it was the last Saturn game that
5233580	5236660	was released in the United States.
5236660	5240300	It actually did not get localized for Europe.
5240300	5245740	So this was a really, really big deal when it came out.
5245740	5249380	Especially since working designs put so much effort into everything.
5249380	5255380	But at any rate, you know, as far as an RPG goes, it was actually a very fun little RPG.
5255380	5260300	You have different puzzles and you had, you sort of played as a tag team of your three
5260300	5261760	main characters.
5261760	5265420	You had Hikaru, Umi, and Fu.
5265420	5271060	And basically they just, you know, they got kidnapped into Sephiroth to save the world
5271060	5273680	as the Magic Knights and yeah.
5273680	5276580	If you haven't seen the anime, then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because
5276580	5279580	it's based off the anime, of course.
5279580	5283500	So you upgrade through story progression.
5283500	5290420	However you do get HP and MP, you know, your hit points and magic points are increased
5290420	5291420	by finding items.
5291420	5298020	But most of the character progress is done through story progression.
5298020	5301660	It had really decent voice acting, I thought.
5301660	5304020	It was all people from Redding, by the way.
5304020	5305020	Did you know that?
5305020	5307300	Because working designs is based off of Redding.
5307300	5308300	Really?
5308300	5309300	Yep.
5309300	5310300	There ain't shit in Redding.
5310300	5311300	You know what else?
5311300	5312300	What?
5312300	5315900	Our Twilight Zone Pinball was owned by the head of working designs.
5315900	5316900	Oh, awesome.
5316900	5319700	We got it from him, that's why we have one of the Goemon dolls from the game that never
5319700	5320700	came out.
5320700	5323700	Anyway, back to this.
5323700	5325180	Yes.
5325180	5327580	They have different weapons, usually the Magic Knights does.
5327580	5332220	Hikaru has fire magic and she has a sword.
5332220	5337540	Umi uses a fencing foil and her powers are all water and ice.
5337540	5341100	I mean, her name is Umi, which means sea.
5341100	5344660	And Hu is a bow and arrow and wind and healing power.
5344660	5346500	So pretty cool.
5346500	5349900	Fu actually, I think, is probably one of the most useful, you know, because once she gets
5349900	5355740	her upgrade, she has this lock-on arrow thing, so that's pretty cool.
5355740	5360620	So anyway, with the game that came out, working designs put a lot of effort into it, as they
5360620	5364420	do with most everything they put out, because they've done a lot of treasure games, they've
5364420	5371120	done a lot of Sega CD RPGs that we never thought that we would get.
5371120	5376260	So when they did this, they actually, for the whole opening sequence, they did, for
5376260	5379780	anyone who's seen the anime, the logo was formed out of these gems.
5379780	5386240	And so they had a new logo made in English that came the same way, except Media Blasters
5386240	5391140	had the rights to rare at the time they designed their own logo, and so they had to use that
5391140	5394040	one.
5394040	5400540	The other problem, too, is that most of the source code for the Japanese version was lost
5400540	5402540	due to a hard drive crash.
5402540	5404540	They had to rebuild the game.
5404540	5405540	Wow.
5405540	5406540	Yeah.
5406540	5412940	So the code that they were missing had to be completely rebuilt, like I just said.
5412940	5416320	They did three different versions of the opening song.
5416320	5424180	They were not allowed to use the original for the English release, so they had one with
5424180	5428340	like completely different lyrics, they had the one that's in the game, and then there
5428340	5436820	was an instrumental, but the CD that came out with everything had all the different
5436820	5437820	versions on it.
5437820	5441980	There was one that was just really hideous, by the way.
5441980	5442980	So yeah.
5442980	5444700	There weren't other Rayearth games for the record.
5444700	5451740	There was a Game Boy one that was Rayearth II, The Missing Colors, Mahokishi Rayearth
5451740	5456980	II, The Missing Colors is what it was, the Super Famicom, and two for the Game Gear.
5456980	5461660	And the second one was called Making of Magic Knight, but the only one that came out in
5461660	5464300	the US was the Saturn game.
5464300	5471100	And there, I have to say, because I've seen, well, I've played through some of the Japanese
5471100	5475160	one, and I've played, of course, the entirety of the US one, and there was a big improvement
5475160	5477100	made, and I'll tell you what it was.
5477100	5481900	In the Japanese one, every time you walked up to a play, and it does this in the US one,
5481900	5486260	you've got dialogue, they make a comment on everything, except in the Japanese one, they
5486260	5488060	said their comment too.
5488060	5491900	It was like, wait to load, wait to load, wait to load.
5491900	5494180	They really fixed some of the loading time issues.
5494180	5500380	And on top of that, the packaging was amazing, and each of the discs, well, I would say that
5500380	5505620	they had three different variations of the discs, one with Hikaru, one with Fu on it,
5505620	5511820	and I think I have the mean one, I think my friend has the Hikaru one, Hikari, sorry.
5511820	5518540	But anyway, it was really good, I mean, there were a lot of people who just thought it was
5518540	5523460	kind of dull, you know, because it was a three year old game when it came out over here.
5523460	5529340	But I think that if you're into a classic and fun RPG, this one's definitely one to
5529340	5532060	check out, if you can find it.
5532060	5536780	That's the other thing, it was the last Saturn game released in the US, it might be hard
5536780	5537780	to find.
5537780	5538780	Slightly.
5538780	5539780	Slightly.
5539780	5540780	Alright.
5540780	5541780	It wasn't bad.
5541780	5546060	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5546060	5547180	It wasn't bad.
5547180	5551020	Magic Knight Ray Earth for the Saturn.
5551020	5553380	I did not know that they were all based in Redding.
5553380	5554900	You know what else is in Redding?
5554900	5555900	Trees.
5555900	5557460	And lots of them.
5557460	5562540	Alright, we are gonna take a quick break here, and it's gonna go down in Mario Kart right
5562540	5563540	now.
5563540	5568300	Get your DS's open, connect to the OL Army room, hopefully you've already added it there,
5568300	5569300	and we're gonna get it started.
5569300	5573580	We're gonna start it live here in just a minute, but I'm gonna break for the podcastees, put
5573580	5576900	in a quick little break, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5576900	5580140	Don't go anywhere though guys, we've got plenty more coming up in part B tonight, we've got
5580140	5584700	The Last Story is coming to Europe, and we're gonna talk more about that and what it could
5584700	5590100	possibly mean for America, and of course, a long time coming mailbag, and plenty more
5590100	5600620	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5600620	5604220	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5604220	5609900	We are live with the second half of our 438th episode for this December the 11th of 2011.
5609900	5614720	Alright, I know you're all dying to know how the Mario Kart matched with the whopping four
5614720	5617060	people that joined in time went.
5617060	5625500	Okay, so first race, I got last place, and I wasn't about ready to commit seppuku live
5625500	5631500	on air because of it, but it happens, I just wasn't getting, and Loki's like, why aren't
5631500	5632500	you drifting?
5632500	5634340	I'm like, I'm trying, shut up.
5634340	5639540	I redeemed myself a little bit in the second race, I was first place for most of the race,
5639540	5643700	for most of the race, but then I did a stupid thing, and I tried to take the detour over
5643700	5648860	to the big ramp, but you really, we were in the Kalamari, or was it Kalamari, Kala something
5648860	5655980	desert level with the train, it's from the Nintendo 64 one, and I tried to take the shortcut,
5655980	5660460	but the shortcut only works if you have a mushroom, and Black Wolf pulled ahead of me
5660460	5663300	by mere inches and won the whole thing.
5663300	5664860	Curse you Black Wolf!
5664860	5665860	Curse you!
5665860	5670140	So, but I got second place at least, although somebody, I think it was Zethur, somebody
5670140	5675780	damn near took over right there at the end, but I was able to just inch out a second place,
5675780	5678900	so that's much better than the last place I did the first time, so.
5678900	5682180	Alright, so there you have it, there's your Mario Kart wrap up, we'll try that again next
5682180	5683180	week.
5683180	5684960	Loki's gonna bring his 3DS next week, right Loki?
5684960	5687580	And then hopefully some of you guys can chat some more, you'll be able to purchase one
5687580	5688580	next week.
5688580	5689580	I had to get the game.
5689580	5691900	I don't think you can do online play with download.
5691900	5692900	Probably not with download, no.
5692900	5693900	But that's alright, I'll play it.
5693900	5694900	You'll have the game by next week.
5694900	5698180	I've been planning on picking it up, but I was gonna do it this week and I just didn't
5698180	5699180	get around to it.
5699180	5701140	So, there you go.
5701140	5704540	So I was like third place overall, with the fourth place and second place.
5704540	5707140	So I wasn't last, I think Tiger Claw was last, sorry buddy.
5707140	5711540	Might have been Zethur, I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.
5711540	5713820	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
5713820	5717700	We're gonna get back into the show here, we got plenty more news to talk about, and of
5717700	5724220	course we have your calls, your emails, lots of emails tonight, and plenty more to come.
5724220	5725220	So let's get back into some news.
5725220	5726220	Loki.
5726220	5730100	Alright, well let's talk a little bit about Grand Theft Auto, because we haven't done
5730100	5733620	enough of that since I stopped playing.
5733620	5740260	Grand Theft Auto 3, coming out on mobile devices next week for $5.
5740260	5746580	And of course that will be out on iOS and also Android marketplaces, and is supported
5746580	5756120	by most of the recent devices, including the Apple iPad 1 and 2, iPhone 4 and 4S, and the
5756120	5760320	fourth generation iPod Touch, which thankfully I have.
5760320	5768220	And also Android phones, the HTC ReSound LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Droid
5768220	5775660	X2, Motorola Photon 4G, Samsung Galaxy R, and T-Mobile G2X, and of course some of the
5775660	5779380	more recent tablets.
5779380	5783960	And it looks fun, hopefully the controls work out pretty well, and definitely worth picking
5783960	5788540	up if you've, you know, I don't know if it supports any Bluetooth controllers, that'd
5788540	5790020	be pretty awesome.
5790020	5794380	But I'm kinda curious to see how the game looks.
5794380	5798140	But $5, so that'll be out on the 15th.
5798140	5804660	And there's a neat rumor going around for the circle pad that's coming out for the 3DS.
5804660	5810220	Apparently it's gonna run on a AAA battery for 480 hours.
5810220	5813140	That's some interesting...
5813140	5821260	Yeah, that's a long time, and shit, you know what, Nintendo, you need to learn something
5821260	5827100	about battery life, because man, those Wii remotes eat batteries like nothing.
5827100	5833500	And this thing, I mean, I guess it just has like an IR relay in it, so maybe it just doesn't
5833500	5835220	take that much.
5835220	5840640	But beneath that's true, even half that would be pretty good, so.
5840640	5848020	Nice to know at least I want to replace batteries like crazy, because I'm not buying it.
5848020	5854460	And finally, Grasshopper and Digital Reality, they have a game coming out called Symora,
5854460	5857420	or Cine Mora, I'm not sure how they're pronouncing it.
5857420	5860060	And it's now gonna be an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive.
5860060	5865120	It was supposed to be kind of a horizontal shmup game that was with 3D graphics and stuff,
5865120	5868540	and kind of a little bit different than Grasshopper, I mean, it's not strange, like, you know,
5868540	5872420	a lot of the stuff that they normally put out.
5872420	5876060	So that's kind of cool that it's gonna be coming out exclusively, though, on Xbox Live
5876060	5882140	Arcade, and not sure now if this is gonna be a timed exclusive, or if it's gonna be,
5882140	5886980	you know, exclusive permanently, but it's still neat, it looks like a pretty awesome
5886980	5890340	looking game, especially if you're a shmup fan.
5890340	5894140	And then of course, they also have another exclusive game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade
5894140	5898140	called Diabolical Pitch, which is really weird, I don't know if you remember seeing it, it's
5898140	5903260	like a zombie survivor horror game, kind of thinking House of the Dead with baseball,
5903260	5910340	where you're throwing baseballs at zombies, and hitting stuff, and I mean, okay, that's
5910340	5914860	kind of more of the Grasshopper stuff, where it's just really weird, but uh, that'd be
5914860	5915860	pretty cool.
5915860	5918940	They need to adapt Battlefield Baseball, because that was a fucking awesome movie.
5918940	5927020	All right, oops, I'm not ready for that story yet, be quiet, all right, moving on with some
5927020	5930580	more news, some rapid fire news, well I guess I'll start with that, since the music popped
5930580	5934740	up in the background here, what you're hearing there, that's the music, I think this is music
5934740	5940860	from the port, it's a Commodore 64 port of the game Cannibal, which to me looks a lot
5940860	5946160	like Bit.Trip Racer, or the, what is it, Magic Unicorn game, Comedy Central, that's
5946160	5947160	on the iPhone.
5947160	5949500	Yeah, this was kind of the first of that series, I think.
5949500	5951540	Yeah, but the music kicks ass, listen to this.
5951540	5963380	I mean, that kicks a lot of ass, now I don't think that's actually the Commodore 64 rendering
5963380	5967580	that, I think that's an MP3, but that's, that's, I mean, the type of stuff that 64 would make,
5967580	5970820	and that's a pretty badass sounding song, but yeah, somebody has actually ported the
5970820	5973540	game to the Commodore 64, that is awesome.
5973540	5976980	So you can Google that to find it, because the link's a little bit complicated, but it's
5976980	5983860	C64ANABALT, and you can, it's being distributed pretty much as freeware, so you can play it
5983860	5986020	in an emulator or what have you.
5986020	5989220	Or just look at the YouTube, it's YouTube user HeavyStylus, and you can just hear that
5989220	5991020	sweet music that's playing there in the background.
5991020	5997380	All right, some other news for you guys, somebody dared to sue Beyonce last year, remember this?
5997380	6002260	A $100 million lawsuit against Beyonce, there was supposed to be a music game that was gonna
6002260	6006660	be created all around her, but I guess for whatever reason she stopped it, and 70 people
6006660	6009700	lost their jobs over the whole thing, well, you know, think about it, they have that Black
6009700	6014180	Eyed Peas game, there's an ABBA dance game, I mean, it's not, there's Michael Jackson,
6014180	6019140	so it's not unheard of that Beyonce might have her own dance game, but it was stopped,
6019140	6024620	and they're now suing Beyonce for $100 million, and I think a lot of people went, hahaha,
6024620	6025620	that'll be a laugh.
6025620	6031100	Well, guess what, the lawsuit was around, allowed to move forward, it was not thrown
6031100	6037740	out of court, so, interesting to see what happens with this as it moves further.
6037740	6039580	Sounds like it might have been a breach of contract kind of thing, huh?
6039580	6043860	This whole thing started a year ago, just to give you an idea how slow the project's
6043860	6045860	moving, so, anyhow.
6045860	6051020	One other thing that'll be of note to our longtime music game fan folks that, you know,
6051020	6056020	have listened to the show for a long time, there is a new cell phone, smartphone version
6056020	6060200	of Dance Dance Revolution that's going to come out here next year.
6060200	6063180	It doesn't have a name yet, but they're saying it's gonna be DDR, and it's supposed to have
6063180	6068260	an emphasis on social gaming, which is ironic, because this whole show started because Dark
6068260	6072100	Soccer Loki and I all met playing DDR, it was a very social thing when it was in arcades.
6072100	6076920	I don't know how you're gonna play DDR on your phone, I think it'll be more like a response
6076920	6082420	to Tap Tap Revenge, which is clearly inspired by this title, if you know what I'm saying.
6082420	6083820	Inspired by, with quotes.
6083820	6088500	Anyhow, yeah, they're saying it's gonna be more of a social game, and it's in Konami's
6088500	6095060	social thing such as Dragon Collection, Sengoku Collection, Professional Baseball, Dream 9,
6095060	6099440	and they're saying it does very well on social networking sites, so we'll see how it does
6099440	6101980	over here.
6101980	6104620	So that'll be coming out next year.
6104620	6105620	Dark Sakura!
6105620	6109260	Well, we have some Tekken Tag Tournament 2 stuff.
6109260	6114420	The field tests are going on in the US for an arcade version.
6114420	6119100	So five different arcades across the US, that's Next Level Arcade in New York City, Round
6119100	6123800	One Entertainment in City of Industry, California, Super Arcade in Walnut, California, Thudworks
6123800	6129460	in Honolulu, and Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas.
6129460	6134820	Also, it's supposed to be coming to consoles, it says Holiday 2012.
6134820	6135820	There's a bunch of holidays.
6135820	6139020	So this is probably gonna be Arbor Day.
6139020	6146460	Also Mario Kart 7 sold 420,000 units its first week in Japan, and Iwata said that it did
6146460	6149260	even better across the world.
6149260	6150960	So that's pretty good, huh?
6150960	6151960	Very nice.
6151960	6155420	Good news for the 3DS.
6155420	6159660	Last bit, we have some good news for Rock Band fans.
6159660	6160660	Rush!
6160660	6161660	Yay!
6161660	6166660	It's the Rush Pack 01 that has Fly By Night, Caravan, and the Spirit of Radio, the live
6166660	6172060	version, and then individual songs, Rebel Love Song by Black Veil, Brides, and Warriors
6172060	6174340	Call by Volbeat.
6174340	6180380	And there is a pro bass and guitar expansion available for Fly By Night and the Spirit
6180380	6183620	of Radio.
6183620	6185620	I like Rush.
6185620	6186620	Rush is a good band.
6186620	6190340	You know, that was one of the songs that I was using to test out everything, was Tom
6190340	6191340	Sawyer.
6191340	6192340	Nice.
6192340	6194340	I was like, I can't sing that high.
6194340	6196780	It was pretty funny.
6196780	6197780	All right.
6197780	6201220	Well, we're gonna get back into some long gaming news here with Loki, but I wanted to
6201220	6205540	plug this first because I promised in chat earlier, Derek, one of the other hosts here
6205540	6209620	at All Games Radio does his own show, Dead Pixel Live, wanted me to plug this.
6209620	6210620	And I said, sure.
6210620	6214640	Because I said last time when we didn't participate, because none of us had the game, we would
6214640	6215640	try to do the next one.
6215640	6219380	And I think the prospects for us participating here look much better.
6219380	6221660	It is the big battle beat down.
6221660	6226740	It is a fighting game tournament that's gonna take place against a bunch of like radio shows.
6226740	6228420	I don't think it's just restricted to all games.
6228420	6231340	I think Derek's gonna try and get whoever he can to be a part of this, but certainly
6231340	6233300	we would like the OL army to be a presence.
6233300	6237820	If you want more information, more information is available at thebigbattle.net.
6237820	6240460	I haven't had enough time since I just kind of found out about this tonight.
6240460	6244300	I haven't had enough time to go through and look at all the specifics, but I can see that
6244300	6246780	there are several games that will be involved here.
6246780	6251620	Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat as in the new one, Street Fighter III
6251620	6256740	3rd Strike Online, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, so a couple Street Fighters and a couple
6256740	6257740	Mortal Kombats.
6257740	6258740	I kind of like the way that was done.
6258740	6260860	You have like the new one and you have the classic one.
6260860	6265340	So whether you're a new gaming fan or a classic gaming fan, there's something for you here
6265340	6267960	where you can represent the OL army.
6267960	6268960	So that'll be fun.
6268960	6273500	I don't know what platform the games are on, or if they're gonna do it multi-platform style
6273500	6276140	somehow, or if it's like gotta all be on 360.
6276140	6280180	But we'll try to get Derek on in the coming weeks, and I think this is not starting until
6280180	6281900	next year.
6281900	6285140	So soon.
6285140	6286140	But check it out.
6286140	6288580	You can sign up in advance at TheBigBattle.net.
6288580	6293700	I'm gonna sign up and participate at least in probably the two Mortal Kombat games.
6293700	6295780	I think I could do Super Street Fighter IV.
6295780	6296820	Here's my problem though.
6296820	6299660	All of them I own on PlayStation 3.
6299660	6303660	Well, no, I have Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox, so I might be able to do some of
6303660	6304660	these.
6304660	6305660	We'll see.
6305660	6308420	So we'll figure it out as time gets closer.
6308420	6311180	Derek might be in chat too to clarify some of this later.
6311180	6313860	But I wanted to give a plug for that, because I do want to participate.
6313860	6316300	So prepare to get your ass kicked, DarkSakura.
6316300	6317300	Alright.
6317300	6318300	What?
6318300	6319300	I'm gonna kick your ass.
6319300	6320300	No.
6320300	6321300	No, leave my ass alone.
6321300	6322300	Yes, I am.
6322300	6323300	Alright.
6323300	6324300	Let's get back into some other gaming news.
6324300	6326100	Lowkey.
6326100	6331060	It's been announced that the last story is coming to Europe.
6331060	6337380	Another one of the Project Rainfall games ported over to English for European players.
6337380	6345380	It's coming out February 24th, and of course no announcement about a North American release,
6345380	6349980	but hey, at least you get another game, Europeans.
6349980	6352380	Another Mistwalker game.
6352380	6353500	And that's fantastic.
6353500	6354660	Apparently it's pretty good.
6354660	6358860	That means there will be an English translation ready for America to pirate.
6358860	6361020	Very soon.
6361020	6365460	Which is what I plan to do if they don't announce this anytime soon for the US.
6365460	6370540	If they're willing to put the US version out within three months or so of the US release.
6370540	6371540	I'll wait.
6371540	6372540	I don't understand why they can't announce that.
6372540	6379140	I mean, they could say, hey, they're doing the English translation already, once again,
6379140	6384340	it requires either no translation or maybe one person working on it for maybe a week
6384340	6392140	at the most to translate English to US English or American English.
6392140	6398940	And honestly, it's fine to replace, I mean, it's so stupid that you know what a jumper
6398940	6399940	is.
6399940	6401660	Do I know what a jumper is?
6401660	6402660	Do you know what a lift is?
6402660	6403660	Yes, I know.
6403660	6404660	Do you know what a lorry is?
6404660	6405660	A lorry?
6405660	6406660	A lorry.
6406660	6407660	A lorry?
6407660	6408660	I don't care.
6408660	6409660	It's a truck.
6409660	6410660	I thought it was a Hue lorry.
6410660	6415380	Well, how many lorries are in the last story, which is a story that took place a long time
6415380	6417220	ago, even though it's the last one.
6417220	6418220	I don't know.
6418220	6422340	Hey, they can have the last story if we can have the final fantasy.
6422340	6428040	Seriously, how many final fantasies have we had a bajillion?
6428040	6431340	This is the final fantasy we're up to as of right now.
6431340	6432340	We're up to 13.
6432340	6433340	Two of them put out.
6433340	6434820	Oh no, wait, we have 14.
6434820	6438740	We have 13 to zero and we have 10 too.
6438740	6441740	And we have mystic quest and crap.
6441740	6443540	We have a lot of spinoffs.
6443540	6445200	It's just what you counted.
6445200	6446540	Mystic quest.
6446540	6447740	You played it.
6447740	6450060	Actually, I ain't even going to lie.
6450060	6453780	I loved mystic quest, but a majority of that was the music was really good for not having
6453780	6454780	been done by Nobuyomatsu.
6454780	6457460	The music in mystic quest is great.
6457460	6462400	But yeah, like, you know, I'm not going to beg and plead for the last story.
6462400	6465940	And if honestly, if it's on something that they just decide, Hey, we're just going to
6465940	6470020	put this out, you know, I got, I'm hoping that there's an announcement within like a
6470020	6476320	week or two because it's ridiculous otherwise, I mean, all you're going to do, I mean, unless
6476320	6481020	are they just going to wait and see how, no, they can't wait and see how the sales are
6481020	6487480	of, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles or whatever it is because it's not coming out until April.
6487480	6489300	So, you know, I don't know.
6489300	6493420	I mean, yeah, it may come out over here, but once again, I'm not, I'm not going to rush
6493420	6501500	out and go get this because I don't know, like it's so easy to import via piracy.
6501500	6504740	I mean, so yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to just be straight up real.
6504740	6506540	This is my real answer.
6506540	6508580	Again it goes that whole kicking them in their wallet thing.
6508580	6513400	Like the ultimatum, if you want to call it is if you don't release it here, I will find
6513400	6518180	a way to obtain the Europe one, whether it be legal or more nefarious means in three
6518180	6524220	months, you get three months to localize it, then I'm done and pirating it if I have to.
6524220	6525820	That's honestly how I feel about it.
6525820	6528360	Like if you don't want my money, then fine, I won't give it to you.
6528360	6533980	But I'm sick of this whole, like what they're doing with Xenoblade is just, I mean, I still
6533980	6535460	don't know what to do about that whole thing.
6535460	6539900	Like I really want to buy it and support it because it's a great game, but I'm really
6539900	6540900	irritated.
6540900	6545180	And I think ultimately the end of the day I'll buy it while I'm irritated at two things.
6545180	6549340	One, I'm irritated that it's this whole exclusive thing with the evil G, which I hate.
6549340	6552000	However, I do understand you can order it from Nintendo.com.
6552000	6556700	So if, if it's Nintendo shipping it to me and not evil, it's still stupid.
6556700	6558220	Why is it exclusive to a retail?
6558220	6562980	I mean, I understand that they may have ponied up money to help import it over fine, whatever
6562980	6563980	that, that's fine.
6563980	6565620	That should have been an issue in the first place.
6565620	6567140	Yeah, actually you're right.
6567140	6568140	It shouldn't have been an issue.
6568140	6571720	They, uh, a company shouldn't have had to say, hey Nintendo, we're going to pay you
6571720	6573300	money to localize it over here.
6573300	6574740	You don't have to fucking localize it.
6574740	6579100	You have to bring it over here and you know, you, you send a copy of the ESRB so you can
6579100	6581820	get rated, which is just standard.
6581820	6586540	And you just put it out over here cause you're publishing, it's first party publishing.
6586540	6589700	Case in point, and I don't think anybody can talk me out of this one.
6589700	6593100	Dark soccer is on the orange launch tumblr right now, orange launch radio.tumblr.com
6593100	6596460	looking at a game called magical jewel pet or something like that.
6596460	6601320	If this can be, if somebody is paying for this to come out on the DS, then somebody
6601320	6607140	can pay for Xenoblade and you can't convince me that Xenoblade, there's something to it
6607140	6612620	that makes it a bigger, more expensive to do because it's already been translated.
6612620	6614460	I don't understand.
6614460	6617060	Like there's so much shovelware that comes out on these systems.
6617060	6619980	There's no room for Xenoblade in this.
6619980	6624580	I don't understand what the, if you've got it translated in English, I mean, I understand
6624580	6627900	if it's a Japanese game that they're just not going to translate into English.
6627900	6628900	Okay.
6628900	6629900	Yes.
6629900	6633260	There's an issue there that, you know, bringing it over here may be unrealistic, but if they're
6633260	6639500	already translating it to English and releasing it in a different part of the world, I don't
6639500	6640500	understand.
6640500	6642840	There's no work you need to do.
6642840	6643840	It's done.
6643840	6645180	It's English already.
6645180	6652940	You don't need to translate anything you can't, I mean, last time I checked when you put translate
6652940	6656800	English to English and like Google translate, it comes out the same.
6656800	6659780	So I don't, I don't understand what they would need to do.
6659780	6661180	Can I ask this too?
6661180	6664000	What's just, what's wrong with a region free system?
6664000	6666960	Like for real, like what, why can't our system just be region free?
6666960	6671620	Like has Sony PlayStation three been hurting because it's region for three free.
6671620	6676840	Are we having like rampant issues, like just tons and tons of people getting all their
6676840	6679900	games from Japan because of, of the region free thing?
6679900	6683220	No, I think the big fucking, I would think if anything, it helps them out.
6683220	6687140	The only time that they may have issues where they're maybe losing out a little bit and
6687140	6692100	not everyone's going to go import stuff because, uh, you know, it's expensive to import some.
6692100	6695940	You're paying almost twice the amount of money that you had paid to buy it locally.
6695940	6700780	Um, and just for, you know, gain, but a lot of times people are buying like stuff that's
6700780	6704780	not going to come out over here or, you know, RPGs that they want a special edition of or
6704780	6705780	something like that.
6705780	6709220	It's not coming out in the United States or North America or whatever.
6709220	6714060	Um, and I mean there's some European games that get released over there first, you know,
6714060	6718960	like there's maybe some IOS games or a little Square Enix games that are going to be released
6718960	6719960	over there.
6719960	6722900	You know, I'm fine with Europe getting the game a little early.
6722900	6727460	I mean shit, they, they get screwed with stuff for us all the time and for them this is a
6727460	6728460	great thing.
6728460	6731540	So I get it, but it's just kind of one of those whole things where it's like, you know,
6731540	6736380	at some point they have to realize, thanks to the internet, we live in a global world.
6736380	6744140	I mean, so far all the Sony systems from like the PSP, the PS3, and now the Vita is supposed
6744140	6745140	to be region free.
6745140	6751220	I mean, DS was region free and then they decided, eh, let's poo poo on that.
6751220	6755900	And now, you know, the 3DS, I'm just waiting for them to come out with something to, you
6755900	6758820	know, like a card reader for the 3DS.
6758820	6763960	I'm sure there's one out there already, I haven't looked, but, um, cause I mean, that's
6763960	6765220	the only way you're going to get stuff.
6765220	6768300	And then you get homebrew and stuff and people modding games, which is kind of cool.
6768300	6770940	And I can go have, you know, a good and bad thing.
6770940	6774940	And then the Xbox 360, believe it or not, is actually region free for a lot of games.
6774940	6778700	You just have to do your research to find out which ones, but there's some games that
6778700	6779700	you can play.
6779700	6784220	Like, uh, there was the Conan game that came out a few years ago.
6784220	6787420	That actually came out in Europe a lot earlier than it came out over here.
6787420	6790900	Not necessarily a game that you would want to get early, but, I mean, if you wanted to
6790900	6796060	play like a God of War knockoff game, and it was pretty fun, um, earlier than you would
6796060	6800760	get it here in the States, you could, if you wanted to pay the money to have it imported.
6800760	6805660	I mean, I don't know, I've done that before with, uh, some of the other Final Fantasy
6805660	6807420	games, but not necessarily on PS3.
6807420	6810980	Alright, I feel like it's just another week and it's the same old rant.
6810980	6812060	When will Nintendo learn?
6812060	6813060	I don't know.
6813060	6816420	Because it seems like Nintendo's also the biggest offender when it comes to Europe getting
6816420	6817420	things late too.
6817420	6820660	Yeah, and here's my problem though with this.
6820660	6825580	I don't want to buy this game because, one, it's, I understand if I buy the game that's
6825580	6830840	supporting the fact that niche games like this do have a place in the United States,
6830840	6835400	but at the same time it also supports the fact that I'm okay with them making us beg
6835400	6839300	for this game and then having to jump through all these hoops to get the game over here.
6839300	6841240	So it's kind of like a double edged sword there.
6841240	6846180	I don't know if I should do that or not, and honestly my choice is I don't play my Wii
6846180	6849720	very much so I'm just not going to buy the game.
6849720	6856140	And I have a feeling though a lot of these other publishers are kind of doing this, Capcom,
6856140	6860100	and they're just making people jump through hoops to get a fucking game out of here.
6860100	6864420	For a franchise, not necessarily a franchise right here, but I mean this is a game that's
6864420	6867500	going to do well with the RPG crowd.
6867500	6872020	I mean you can't expect this to be, Final Fantasy, I mean hell, a Final Fantasy game
6872020	6875460	or something like that is not going to appeal to everyone, fuck, Skyrim is not going to
6875460	6876460	appeal to everybody.
6876460	6880820	I mean, mom and, your people that are playing Wii Sports and stuff like that don't give
6880820	6881820	a fuck about Skyrim.
6881820	6885380	They're just like, they would blow their mind, they're just like, I don't know what to do
6885380	6886380	with this.
6886380	6887380	Too many buttons.
6887380	6888380	Exactly.
6888380	6889380	It's like my wife trying to play it.
6889380	6894260	I can't look, I can't adjust the camera and move the character at the same time.
6894260	6895420	So I mean it just blew their mind.
6895420	6902300	So you can't look at it doing as well as like a, you know, a Mario game.
6902300	6903900	I mean it's just not going to appeal to everybody.
6903900	6906060	But you have to look at the RPG crowd.
6906060	6910060	It's got to do better than like Princess Jewel Pet or whatever, you know?
6910060	6911740	Yeah, I know, it will do better than that.
6911740	6914900	And there's a lot of like Wii games I think that sell based on like box art.
6914900	6918820	It's like people are like, oh that's a game my son would like or my grandson would like
6918820	6920820	and I'm going to buy it.
6920820	6924700	And I, yeah, there's a lot of crap out there.
6924700	6925700	Alright.
6925700	6926700	Let's move on.
6926700	6927940	We've got to move on with more stories or we're going to be here all night.
6927940	6931760	So I want to talk about a story about the PlayStation Vita.
6931760	6933780	It's not about region free and all that stuff.
6933780	6934780	Is the Vita region free?
6934780	6935780	I can't remember.
6935780	6936780	It's not.
6936780	6937780	It's supposed to be.
6937780	6938780	It's supposed to be.
6938780	6940780	They're saying that it is but I don't think anyone's really gotten one.
6940780	6941780	We'll find out soon.
6941780	6944860	Obviously there's, it's only out in one region and no one's really confirmed either way.
6944860	6945980	I think it is.
6945980	6947900	Alright, we'll find out soon.
6947900	6952420	Well some of the rabble that was going on this week, thanks to a NeoGaf post, because
6952420	6956700	NeoGaf has huge forums and a lot of people post there so sometimes there's some interesting
6956700	6958780	leaks and things that come out there.
6958780	6964300	And apparently one of the posters was at a PlayStation Vita event in Japan this week and
6964300	6971400	apparently the information said that only one user account can be used on the system.
6971400	6977140	So if you tend to share your gaming systems, like say Alan and I do, or Jamie and Dan share
6977140	6980860	all their gaming systems, I'm sure, or Loki and Nellie share their gaming systems.
6980860	6981860	We do.
6981860	6985620	Well, what system did you try to teach Nellie?
6985620	6987780	Was it Nellie's copy of Skyrim you tried to teach her?
6987780	6989860	No, I don't share portable systems.
6989860	6996700	Oh, see, well, Alan uses Netflix on the 3DS all the time.
6996700	7000380	Like he uses Netflix more than I do because he really gets a lot of use out of the 3DS
7000380	7001380	thing.
7001380	7007540	But then he'll also play my copy of Mario Kart on my save file, which is okay, it's
7007540	7008540	fine.
7008540	7009540	He's unlocking some stuff.
7009540	7013900	Like it works great for a game like Super Mario 3D Land where you have three save files.
7013900	7014900	I'm number one.
7014900	7015900	He's number two.
7015900	7019420	And if I ever let a friend come over and play the game, they can have save file number three.
7019420	7020420	It works out great.
7020420	7021420	Oh, that's right.
7021420	7022420	He told me to write over save file one.
7022420	7023420	Shut up.
7023420	7024420	It's true.
7024420	7029500	But anyway, my point is that some people do, especially couples and stuff will tend to
7029500	7031580	share these systems a lot.
7031580	7038300	So when they heard that only one user per system, it was a little bit of an alarm.
7038300	7043580	However, there was a follow up article that came out very quickly afterwards.
7043580	7048760	And that is the official line from Sony America quote, your PlayStation network ID is bonded
7048760	7054220	to your memory card and your memory card is bonded to your Vita.
7054220	7060340	So in other words, you can have multiple PlayStation network accounts, each tied to a memory card.
7060340	7065460	But if you try to move the account from one card to another, it's going to get more interesting.
7065460	7069060	And we just had the story last week about all those memory cards now freaking expensive.
7069060	7070060	They are.
7070060	7071060	Yeah.
7071060	7072060	So it's yeah.
7072060	7073060	Like good news and bad news.
7073060	7074060	Good news.
7074060	7075060	Yes.
7075060	7076060	You can't have more than one account.
7076060	7077060	Bad news.
7077060	7078460	You're gonna have to buy more memory cards to do it.
7078460	7080700	And then you can't just move them from one Vita to another.
7080700	7081700	It sounds like.
7081700	7082700	Yeah.
7082700	7086460	I mean, honestly, I don't like the fact that they're tied to your to your Vita.
7086460	7090740	I don't see how that's necessary because what's the point in having a memory card then?
7090740	7096340	I mean, I guess someone was saying, well, I can't take my memory card from, you know,
7096340	7098300	one Vita and play it on my friend's Vita.
7098300	7099580	But it's like, why would you do that?
7099580	7102420	Just take your Vita with you.
7102420	7105540	But I don't know if it's really a problem that a lot of people have.
7105540	7110940	It sucks that they're doing this, tying it to the system and stuff because and it's just
7110940	7117480	bad for Sony because this is a problem that will be solved by hacking, unfortunately.
7117480	7124940	And only creating these problems creates people that want to find the solution for it.
7124940	7129900	And the solution is not good for Sony, unfortunately.
7129900	7133220	Allen's in chat right now, and his feathers are a little ruffled at what I said about
7133220	7134220	Mario Kart.
7134220	7137780	He says, Salacious Pops in chat saying, well, I always win and unlock shit.
7137780	7139500	So, you know.
7139500	7142100	Maybe he's better than better than you at drifting.
7142100	7143540	Yeah, perhaps, perhaps.
7143540	7144540	Shut up.
7144540	7148060	I almost considered asking you if I could play your second match.
7148060	7150140	Oh, I wouldn't let you.
7150140	7151140	I could.
7151140	7152140	Oh, man.
7152140	7155140	We got to maybe next week, if you don't have your own copy by then I'll let you race during
7155140	7156140	the midpoint break.
7156140	7157140	All right.
7157140	7158140	Anyway.
7158140	7160800	Also, I want to point out what the Rob D is saying in our chat room and chat that orange
7160800	7161800	on Twitter.com.
7161800	7162800	Yeah.
7162800	7165340	Japan has a totally separate set of standards when it comes to this sort of thing.
7165340	7168140	They don't care whether lots of people buy their stuff.
7168140	7169780	They care about making money.
7169780	7173100	They will not price niche media and aim for the most sales.
7173100	7178940	They will price niche media for the passionate people and gouge them.
7178940	7179940	I mean.
7179940	7180940	Okay.
7180940	7181940	Listen.
7181940	7182940	Ironic.
7182940	7186180	This is coming right after the Xenoblade last story stuff about gouging niche people.
7186180	7187180	Listen.
7187180	7189420	I understand that, you know, the memory cards.
7189420	7190420	Okay.
7190420	7191420	The memory cards are what they are.
7191420	7196420	You're either going to just buy one and just get over the fact that they're fucking expensive
7196420	7198500	and just buy one because guess what?
7198500	7204140	The PSP Memory Stick Pro Duos were fucking expensive when they came out and that shit
7204140	7209460	came down in price once, you know, other peripherals and stuff were using them.
7209460	7210460	Yes.
7210460	7211580	It's a proprietary card.
7211580	7212660	Just get over it.
7212660	7215380	Buy your fucking four gig card or whatever the hell.
7215380	7216380	Trust me.
7216380	7219940	You're not going to need more than four gigs for the system unless you're downloading a
7219940	7223960	ton of games online, in which case you can, you know, think about maybe getting a bigger
7223960	7224960	one later on.
7224960	7229100	But, I mean, for me, if I was going to get a Vita, whatever, I'm going to be the only
7229100	7230100	one using the thing.
7230100	7234460	So, it's not a big deal for me and yeah, it sucks for people that want to share.
7234460	7239860	It's not the end of the world, in my opinion, is that, you know, as far as, you know, let's
7239860	7243220	say at Alan and I's house where we're both, you know, big gamers and nerds and stuff,
7243220	7245020	I can kind of say, obviously, I'm getting a Vita.
7245020	7248940	I mean, no question because I have to have all the nerd stuff and, you know, it's going
7248940	7252020	to be, I think, a good system, got a lot of good games coming on it.
7252020	7255620	As far as the save file goes, I at least like the fact that, you know, we could get Alan
7255620	7260060	a cheap little memory card for his saves and then he can have his own PlayStation Network
7260060	7261060	ID.
7261060	7264520	Or, at the end of the day, if it's really just save files, I mean, if a game will still
7264520	7268940	give you three save slots or something on one memory card, then, you know, or a lot
7268940	7271980	of Sony games kind of let you save an unlimited number of files.
7271980	7275900	Like I have like seven saves on White Knight Chronicles 2 just because it just keeps adding
7275900	7276900	to the list.
7276900	7278180	Skyrim, I think I have six or seven saves too.
7278180	7279180	These are all on PS3.
7279180	7283740	So, he can just have his own saves and I don't think he's going to really care about trophies
7283740	7284740	on his own account.
7284740	7285740	Maybe he will.
7285740	7289380	Well, here's what I'm worried about and here's why I think the reason why they're doing this.
7289380	7293780	It's like on the PlayStation 3, if you download, say download content or whatever, everybody
7293780	7295540	I think on the console can use that.
7295540	7296540	Oh, no.
7296540	7298340	I know where you're going with this.
7298340	7301700	And so, now, they're going to get you, oh, hey, you like that download content.
7301700	7302700	Well, fuck you.
7302700	7305540	You're going to have to buy it for yourself instead of sharing it.
7305540	7306780	That is kind of shitty actually.
7306780	7311300	So, that's kind of what they're doing I think with this.
7311300	7314420	But like once again, you know, listen, it is what it is.
7314420	7317260	You either either just get over yourself.
7317260	7318260	You either support it or you don't.
7318260	7321220	Yeah, you either get over yourself and buy the system or not.
7321220	7325500	I mean, is that really going to hold you back that you got to buy an expensive memory card?
7325500	7328100	I don't have to like it and I can complain on the internet.
7328100	7331900	I mean, just deal with it and that's it.
7331900	7336620	I mean, it sucks and I'm sure there will be a third party work around.
7336620	7341020	But, I mean, unless you really want to wait for that, and you know what, hey, there's
7341020	7342460	nothing wrong with waiting.
7342460	7345980	Yeah, everybody's going to be buying, well, not everybody, but a lot of people are going
7345980	7346980	to be buying it at launch.
7346980	7347980	But guess what?
7347980	7350820	You know, prices come down, there's bundles that come out later on, you get a bunch of
7350820	7351820	free shit.
7351820	7355220	So, just wait if you're unsure about it.
7355220	7359660	Wait until the following holiday season and stuff and you might score it even cheaper
7359660	7360660	than it is now.
7360660	7364200	We're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute here, but I want to read one more
7364200	7367300	comment from chat from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.
7367300	7368300	He's trolling.
7368300	7369300	Listen to this.
7369300	7375180	Bobby Blackwolf says in chat, you mean I could have beaten both Sky and Loki at Mario Kart?
7375180	7380200	I think he's throwing down the gauntlet there a little bit.
7380200	7386580	Could have if you were good enough to beat me.
7386580	7387580	It's on.
7387580	7388720	It's already been brought in.
7388720	7389720	I like this.
7389720	7393620	I think we need to do more of this where we play games either right before, well, I don't
7393620	7396500	want to say before because we don't want to step on Bobby's toes, maybe right after OLR
7396500	7397620	during the midpoint break.
7397620	7400380	I like the idea that people can kind of play games or even during the show.
7400380	7403540	Shit, I don't care if you're playing Mario Kart right now and like listening to OLR.
7403540	7407540	We'll have to play after his show because we don't want him crying during his show.
7407540	7416420	Uh oh, uh oh, alright.
7416420	7422660	Moving on, on that note, let's get to the mailbag.
7422660	7423660	Thousands and thousands of emails received.
7423660	7428080	You have to remember, this is the first mailbag since all the website outage stuff.
7428080	7430140	So our emails have been piling up.
7430140	7432300	So unfortunately Dark Sakura can only pick a few.
7432300	7436780	Dark Sakura has sifted through the mailbox like it was kitty litter, has sifted through
7436780	7440900	the mailbox and pulled out a few nuggets for you.
7440900	7441900	You know what?
7441900	7446060	There's this one Caturday picture that I kept seeing on the web of a cat standing up looking
7446060	7453060	super surprised, saying, someone keeps coming in and stealing my poop!
7453060	7455060	And you just made me think of that.
7455060	7458980	So let's see who's poop we've stolen.
7458980	7463220	The first one, hi OLR, it's me again, your friendly, catastrophic Moggy.
7463220	7465820	I know it's been a while since I last emailed.
7465820	7469780	After listening to your last show and Rob Stark contrasting with Skyrim and Final Fantasy
7469780	7475620	13, the two show clearly the difference between western and Japanese RPGs.
7475620	7477860	Western RPGs mainly focus on character creation.
7477860	7481060	You're lucky if you get to even pick a name in a JRPG.
7481060	7482060	And world exploration.
7482060	7486780	While JRPGs focus on story and character drama leading to a much more linear affair.
7486780	7490180	Also Rob, have you played either of the first two Elder School games?
7490180	7492220	They're both now available as freeware.
7492220	7495860	If you think Skyrim is big, you should check out Daggerfall, which boasts a game world
7495860	7500140	twice the size of Great Britain that would take over two full weeks to cross in real
7500140	7501140	time.
7501140	7502960	Yeah, but it's all just an algorithm generated thing.
7502960	7508500	Of course it is all randomly generated, so it's quite, all quite samey.
7508500	7511620	Before I go, I just wanted to pass on some preview footage of a game to you because I
7511620	7513100	know how much you love the series.
7513100	7516220	I bet it will be 20% cooler than any other game.
7516220	7517220	Hear you later, Moggy.
7517220	7522060	And it is Silent Ponyville, the game.
7522060	7523060	Nice.
7523060	7524060	Oh, can you send me the link for that?
7524060	7527940	I want to, I want to, just copy paste and chat so we can, I want to see this Silent
7527940	7528940	Ponyville.
7528940	7529940	Silent Hill.
7529940	7530940	Hold on.
7530940	7531940	But with my little pony or something.
7531940	7536860	Um, and just real quick on the whole, uh, um, earlier Elder Scrolls games.
7536860	7540180	I haven't really played them a lot in depth, but I'm kind of familiar with them.
7540180	7545420	And I especially know the older like PC RPGs, how they used to be like they'd be vast, but
7545420	7549540	the dungeons weren't quite as visual as they are now.
7549540	7553540	Like people like Skyrim because not only is it big, but it looks real.
7553540	7555460	Like the, the graphics are getting so good.
7555460	7556460	All right.
7556460	7558020	Um, I'm going to fast forward here a little bit.
7558020	7559020	Silent Ponyville.
7559020	7561620	It's exactly what it is.
7561620	7566780	It's a silent Hill meets my little pony.
7566780	7567780	Is there a pyramid head in this?
7567780	7571180	It comes out and chops her head off.
7571180	7574460	This is like some of these art project that they spent a lot of time making.
7574460	7578660	Not sure how to feel about this.
7578660	7579660	Next email.
7579660	7580660	Hi, OLR.
7580660	7583060	Doesn't seem to be anything going on there.
7583060	7584540	Brave about ready player one.
7584540	7589260	I was all ears being myself, rather old gamer started with the C64.
7589260	7593700	So I bought myself a copy and I've just started, but it really is a page turner.
7593700	7596100	If you have the chance, do get the author on your show.
7596100	7600700	I'm certain that that will result in a very interesting podcast.
7600700	7603260	Best regards from the UK, Mark.
7603260	7605540	Uh, so we'll try.
7605540	7607700	I forgot to look into that, but we will.
7607700	7608700	Our listeners can read.
7608700	7609700	Yes, of course they can read.
7609700	7612100	How dare you insult the listeners from the UK.
7612100	7614340	So I'm assuming you can read.
7614340	7619060	Therefore he's more well educated, more, more, more better, more smarter, more smarter, more
7619060	7620780	better, gooder reader.
7620780	7622420	Um, okay.
7622420	7624860	Hey guys, this is blade three, AKA Sam one.
7624860	7626860	Well, what are you blade three or Sam one?
7626860	7628500	Oh no, Sam.
7628500	7630320	He's not using any punctuation.
7630320	7631320	So whatever.
7631320	7637140	I just wanted to say to Loki that Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly
7637140	7638140	like Rob.
7638140	7640660	It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.
7640660	7642580	Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.
7642580	7643580	Keep up the good work.
7643580	7644580	The show is fantastic.
7644580	7645860	I've been listening since I five thanks to you guys.
7645860	7649700	By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut
7649700	7650700	some slack.
7650700	7651700	Oh, exclamation point.
7651700	7657460	Seriously, that's the only, okay, I'm going to reread this email the way it's written.
7657460	7658460	All right.
7658460	7661400	Hey guys, this is blade three AKA Sam one.
7661400	7665740	I just wanted to say that Loki Laszlo on integrity 2.0 radio and GTA four sounds exactly like
7665740	7666740	Rob.
7666740	7667740	It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.
7667740	7669540	Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.
7669540	7670540	Keep up the good work.
7670540	7671540	This show is fantastic.
7671540	7672540	I've been listening since I five thanks guys.
7672540	7675840	By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000 so cut
7675840	7676840	some slack.
7676840	7677840	Go.
7677840	7678840	So cut some slack.
7678840	7679840	Oh yeah.
7679840	7680840	Why aren't you cutting some slack?
7680840	7681840	Oh, all right.
7681840	7682840	I don't know what the fuck's like.
7682840	7685900	Oh, I have heard the, um, Laszlo comparison before.
7685900	7686900	Actually.
7686900	7687900	You're not the first to mention it.
7687900	7688900	Funny enough.
7688900	7691420	I haven't played enough grand theft auto where I know that.
7691420	7694220	I know it's like the one game series I don't play enough of.
7694220	7696300	So um, I'll just have to take your word for it.
7696300	7701100	I would love to loan my voice to a game sometime though.
7701100	7704060	Maybe when they do legend of the magical pony too.
7704060	7706060	All right.
7706060	7707060	Yeah.
7707060	7708060	I want to be in a game.
7708060	7709060	Rob.
7709060	7710060	I'm going to do voice acting.
7710060	7711060	I think it would be fun.
7711060	7713340	I think that we would be awesome voice actors.
7713340	7715260	I think so too.
7715260	7719620	So um, we should do, we should get a video game script and reenact it live on OLR.
7719620	7720620	We could do that.
7720620	7725380	You know, if we wanted to get someone with the fun voice just on the show randomly, we
7725380	7727500	should get agro on here.
7727500	7732620	We should get, do dramatic reading of eight bit video games, strip scripts, but we should
7732620	7734740	get agro on here sometime to do his announcer voice.
7734740	7735740	Oh God.
7735740	7736740	Oh God.
7736740	7737740	That guy from wow.
7737740	7738740	Oh God.
7738740	7739740	So cool.
7739740	7740740	Why?
7740740	7741740	Hello.
7741740	7742740	Hi everyone.
7742740	7747020	I just finished listening to November's internet outrage ridden podcast and it's one time I'm
7747020	7748420	glad I don't listen live.
7748420	7749420	Oh yeah.
7749420	7750900	Well I'm not going to read it.
7750900	7752220	No, sorry.
7752220	7756780	Anyhow, being an avid Android gamer, I wanted to chime in with my suggestions for your Twitter

7762300	7765180	having kittens because that just makes sure me feel inadequate.
7765180	7766180	Well, that's okay.
7766180	7767180	Cause sure.
7767180	7768180	Me can't have kittens anyway.
7768180	7769180	She's too old.
7769180	7770180	Her uterus fell out.
7770180	7772700	No, that got yanked out when she was a kitten.
7772700	7773700	Okay.
7773700	7774700	Angry.
7774700	7775700	She's looking now.
7775700	7776700	She heard her name.
7776700	7777700	She heard her name.
7777700	7778700	She's like, you talk about my uterus.
7778700	7781860	She's like, girl, I haven't had a uterus since.
7781860	7785180	What's uterus talking about Willis?
7785180	7789100	How many times can we say uterus in one radio show?
7789100	7790100	Angry birds.

7813980	7816700	You getting her on the radio?
7816700	7818740	I'm trying to get sure me to review the games.
7818740	7820220	You hear me?
7820220	7821220	Hey baby.
7821220	7822220	All right.
7822220	7823220	No.
7823220	7824220	Okay.
7824220	7825220	Yes.
7825220	7826220	That's how I talk to my cat.
7826220	7827220	Um, bonsai blast.

7836620	7838420	You misspelled mystery by the way.
7838420	7840500	With a twist ending ported from a flash game.
7840500	7841500	Duck hunter.
7841500	7844780	Think SNES classic minus the dog with really funny foul play.
7844780	7846260	Ah, I see your pun.
7846260	7847260	Haha.
7847260	7848260	Fruit Ninja blah.
7848260	7849260	Yeah.
7849260	7850780	Care for fruit salad and have a minute to lose.
7850780	7853060	Flick at your screen and get as many fruits before the time runs out.
7853060	7854060	You'll have a blast.
7854060	7857700	You're still trying to make my cat talk.
7857700	7858860	I'm rubbing her belly.
7858860	7860300	She likes it.

7862900	7863900	No, really.
7863900	7864900	That's about it.

7872060	7873900	What the crap game is that?
7873900	7875480	Pumpkins versus monsters.
7875480	7876480	It's a clone.
7876480	7877480	Um, you know what?
7877480	7879180	I'm not reading the rest of this.
7879180	7883140	Um, well hopefully at least one of them sparked your listeners or your interest.
7883140	7884140	Listen to you next week.
7884140	7885140	Dr Noir.
7885140	7889660	Well, I wanted to hear more about pumpkin whatevers, but our soccer was like, no smiley
7889660	7891660	pops.
7891660	7898780	PSS email is written at 5am while waiting for a delayed flight back to Mexico at a Colombian

7900420	7901980	I know ironic, right?
7901980	7903620	After four straight 15 hour workday.
7903620	7905700	So if I misspelled something, blame it on the exhaustion.
7905700	7911420	Okay, I forgive you this time and I'll, I might go post your list later.
7911420	7914500	I'll put it on the tumbler eventually.
7914500	7917860	Xbox has followed in the footsteps of PSN network.
7917860	7920140	That's redundant, isn't it?
7920140	7921140	PSN network.
7921140	7923300	That's like ATM card or pin number.
7923300	7925100	Are you thinking ATM machine?
7925100	7926100	Yeah.
7926100	7927500	ATM machine and pin number.
7927500	7928500	Yeah.
7928500	7933580	Um, I've linked an article though I actually didn't hear about it from them.
7933580	7938300	My husband is in law school and he actually reads the terms of service before he agrees.
7938300	7942460	Anyway, the overall impression he gave me was this is a crappy backhanded move, but
7942460	7945780	as far as crappy backhanded moves go, it's not so bad.
7945780	7949260	Essentially while they block you from class action, they agreed to pay all fees associated
7949260	7954420	with arbitration and formally agreed to pay a thousand dollars or what the arbitrator
7954420	7957500	decides is fair, whichever is greater.
7957500	7958500	It's still crappy though.
7958500	7961540	And that's from Holly D.
7961540	7962700	It's still crappy.
7962700	7963700	It's still crappy.
7963700	7964700	But I agree.
7964700	7965700	Less crappy.
7965700	7968220	Uh, this is from Robobobobobobobob.
7968220	7971860	I sent the following email to my state's consumer protection division of the attorney general's
7971860	7972860	office.
7972860	7973980	I'll let you know what they reply.
7973980	7978940	I did discover that my mandatory arbitration can be disputed if you feel treated unfairly.
7978940	7982900	Oddly enough, it would take something extraordinary for me to want to sue a game system manufacturer.
7982900	7983900	And it's from Robobobobob.
7983900	7985460	Like I just said.
7985460	7986980	And this is the email.
7986980	7991220	I give this guy massive props for actually doing something about it though.
7991220	7997340	Lately, video game console manufacturers are updating their EULAs for operating their game
7997340	7999860	systems with mandatory arbitration clauses.
7999860	8006900	Are there sources of information on what clauses are allowed in EULAs and what clauses are
8006900	8008940	invalidated by Maryland law?
8008940	8013420	As for my own opinion, it doesn't seem wrong, no, it seems wrong that an expensive electronics
8013420	8017340	device can be rendered useless if you don't agree completely with the EULA.
8017340	8020860	Thanks for any response, Robobobobobobob.
8020860	8023620	That's not how he signed it, but I'm still saying it.
8023620	8025660	I still want to see what reply.
8025660	8026660	Okay.
8026660	8028660	And, um, that's it.
8028660	8029660	All right.
8029660	8030860	I mean, that's not it.
8030860	8034180	Of course, for emails, we got a bajillion emails.
8034180	8035500	It's been building up for like a month.
8035500	8036500	Keep in mind.
8036500	8037500	But I ain't reading anymore.
8037500	8041220	But if you would like to be considered for next week, we read them all at least mailbag
8041220	8043580	at orange lounge radio.com.
8043580	8048140	And by the way, you have a better chance if your email is like concise, just so you know,
8048140	8049860	because the run on ones are a little harder to read.
8049860	8051580	So there's one more I want to read from Robobobobob.
8051580	8052580	All right.
8052580	8053580	It's older.
8053580	8055460	The Peeta Tanooki suit thing is still topical.
8055460	8057780	I'll show you my thesis on this.
8057780	8059460	I love how he writes, though.
8059460	8061940	Peeta is intentionally grabbing negative attention for donations.
8061940	8064460	It has nothing to do with what they are trying to protect.
8064460	8069020	How better to get attention by being negative publicity about a beloved icon?
8069020	8070020	Peeta's logic is this.
8070020	8073100	An imaginary character wears an imaginary suit with special powers.
8073100	8077940	This Tanooki suit resembles a Tanooki fur, which a Tanooki is a mythical creature burglarized
8077940	8079900	as a raccoon dog.
8079900	8084380	So the imaginary prospect of killing an animal is bad slash evil, so send money.
8084380	8088940	Peeta is pretty famous for flinging fake blood on real furs to demonstrate the cruelty of
8088940	8091300	the fur industry and equating fur with murder.
8091300	8094660	So their fake blood is that of a fake animal or worse, of a fake human.
8094660	8097940	By their own logic, they are advocating animal slash people slaughter.
8097940	8101140	I think Jamie said it best, which she said a few weeks ago, Peeta is crazy.
8101140	8104060	Of course, that's why people love picking on Mickey Mouse, too.
8104060	8105940	Okay, that's it.
8105940	8106940	All right.
8106940	8109700	We're back at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8109700	8112780	This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because it's our show
8112780	8115980	and sometimes we have angst and we have to get it all out in a segment called The FUs
8115980	8133220	of the Week.
8133220	8140580	A big FU goes to the increased militarization of national police forces and to there not
8140580	8146580	being enough change in the way people vote to where we still have assholes in office
8146580	8153060	and also to assholes running for office who like to wear the same jacket from Burbank
8153060	8154060	Mountain.
8154060	8155060	Uh, Logie.
8155060	8163940	Fucking in my radio in my car because apparently the track skip forward button is starting
8163940	8169900	to break and so sometimes it thinks, or actually most of the time now, it thinks I'm hitting
8169900	8177380	track backwards and then sometimes it thinks I'm also changing the mode of my, you know,
8177380	8180140	player to play the radio or something like that.
8180140	8183100	Or sometimes it will actually work and go forward.
8183100	8188700	So that fucking sucks because now it's making it very difficult to pick the song I want
8188700	8189700	to listen to.
8189700	8195540	Alright, my FU, uh, first one goes to Rick Perry because he's such an assbag and I have
8195540	8196540	a right to say that.
8196540	8199100	I believe that Rick Perry is an assbag.
8199100	8200100	And you know what?
8200100	8205620	I imagine when you said assbag, he was actually the bag that attaches to a colostomy.
8205620	8211900	That's pretty much what he is and just, just discussing and gross and insulting the way
8211900	8213260	he's pandering people.
8213260	8214380	It's just insulting.
8214380	8218180	So just, I don't know, barf barfy barfs.
8218180	8223620	Did you see the thing that Santorin said, Oh, that guy, he's even bigger of an idiot.
8223620	8224700	Oh my God.
8224700	8225700	So many.
8225700	8231580	And like, I'm really trying not to be like all one side or the other, but like, let me,
8231580	8237260	here's the nice thing I can say about the dog and pony show that's going on over there.
8237260	8243460	Some of them know when to keep their mouth shut and that's, that's a good compliment,
8243460	8246540	but some of them need to learn such humility.
8246540	8252740	It's just, so anyway, um, without getting too political, whoops.
8252740	8257560	But my other FU, I will say that's a little sillier is FU to, um, FU to the fact that
8257560	8262660	in looking for raid in world of Warcraft, um, that only one piece of gear has dropped
8262660	8263660	for me.
8263660	8267540	Can I add to that too FU to that pug last night.
8267540	8271140	You need, you need to do what I do and start writing down their names and servers and reading
8271140	8272380	it on the Horde house.
8272380	8273380	John wrote them all down.
8273380	8274380	Oh, did he?
8274380	8275380	Yeah.
8275380	8276380	We were going to email you.
8276380	8277380	Oh, you should.
8277380	8278380	You should do that.
8278380	8279380	They were all from the same server.
8279380	8280380	All right.
8280380	8281380	Dick faces.
8281380	8282380	So, all right.
8282380	8283380	Uh, there you go.
8283380	8284540	That's, that's it for the FUs of the week.
8284540	8287460	Just a few more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at one eight seven
8287460	8292240	seven game O L R or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio at us on Skype.
8292240	8294780	If you haven't already, but we'll get to that in a minute.
8294780	8295780	First more stories.
8295780	8296780	Lucky.
8296780	8297780	Yes.
8297780	8304100	Uh, this is kind of neat on live is finally coming to the iOS platform as well as Android
8304100	8310740	and uh, it's really, you can actually use it to, um, play games on your tablet or phone
8310740	8311740	device.
8311740	8316660	Um, they also are going to be selling a wireless controller that comes with the free app download
8316660	8322660	as well for about, I want to say 50 bucks, uh, which also is the same price as the streaming
8322660	8324460	console if you really want to.
8324460	8330180	Um, and it is Bluetooth and allows you the, you know, basically use your tablet as you
8330180	8336540	know, a screen instead of having to use the on screen touch sensitive buttons and stuff
8336540	8340100	that they have, which they have that option if you don't want to do that.
8340100	8344700	Um, and apparently also some of the games that they're, they're actually converting
8344700	8347660	over to work with the touch controls on these tablets.
8347660	8352260	Like for example, LA noir was something that rockstar games is actually going back and
8352260	8357460	um, you know, fixing that up so that you can use, you know, touch controls with the game
8357460	8358460	as well.
8358460	8364100	Um, and I want to say there was a kingdoms, uh, was a kingdom of keffi limbs, uh, that
8364100	8367900	was also going to be getting the kind of the same treatment as well.
8367900	8372940	Um, it just looks kind of neat and I guess it works pretty well.
8372940	8376900	Um, I actually thought about downloading this to try it.
8376900	8380780	I don't know if I have to actually purchase the app to check it out, but obviously you
8380780	8384300	need an online subscription and stuff, but it'd be neat to check out.
8384300	8385300	Not necessarily.
8385300	8390460	I like, I would not want to play on my iPod though with the screen controls cause I can
8390460	8393260	imagine my, my hand would cover the whole damn thing.
8393260	8396200	Um, but it's still kind of neat that they could do this.
8396200	8401580	You know what would be really cool, I guess, I don't know if that, if it has the power
8401580	8407100	to do that, but, um, the Apple TV, you know, if you could do an app like that, but you
8407100	8411280	know, with the rumors around the corner that, you know, Apple is actually creating their
8411280	8416260	own TV set soon, this very well could be integrated into something like one way to get more Apple
8416260	8417260	TVs sold.
8417260	8420780	Like I'm talking about the actual set top boxes, just build it into an actual TV.
8420780	8421780	Yeah.
8421780	8427620	So, um, make them in cool colors and everybody will want one that it's an interesting prospect
8427620	8431340	that, you know, this is gonna, if it worked, I mean, it works pretty good.
8431340	8436740	Um, of course the only downside is obviously it's not going to work as good as your, you
8436740	8442780	know, streaming console because, you know, those are normally wired connections versus
8442780	8443780	this.
8443780	8448220	You probably want to be on wifi to be able to play the games, you know, full resolution
8448220	8449580	without any lag.
8449580	8453220	Um, although from what I was reading, like, you know, games are normally 60 frames per
8453220	8458660	second, it was 50 frames per second and you know, maybe the resolution's a little lower,
8458660	8462020	um, than it would normally be, but, um, overall, not too bad.
8462020	8467660	I actually saw some gameplay footage of someone playing, um, saints row the third on an iPod
8467660	8469060	or something like that.
8469060	8470060	Wow.
8470060	8475140	So that was kind of cool looking saints row third on the go as tempting.
8475140	8480740	But uh, um, yeah, I don't know, it's a really neat, neat idea.
8480740	8484340	So it'd be interesting to see, you know, what games are support right now.
8484340	8489420	They don't have all of the games obviously supporting this, but, um, they're launching
8489420	8496840	with about 18 games and, um, you know, I guess they launched originally with 21 games when
8496840	8503180	the streaming console came out and, um, you know, they're going to be adding more as they,
8503180	8507940	you know, convert some over and, um, get them to work a little bit better with the portable
8507940	8508940	systems.
8508940	8509940	All right.
8509940	8510940	Very interesting.
8510940	8513060	The way this technology is going, I think this could be a pretty huge in the future
8513060	8517140	because even if it's not on live itself, people are going to see what on live is doing and
8517140	8521300	think, Hmm, how can we do that for our gaming experience?
8521300	8524420	It's just a matter of time before developers just cut out on life completely.
8524420	8529340	I mean, especially on something like I asked why the only thing you need on life for is
8529340	8533740	their bandwidth and maybe I don't think the technology is particularly proprietary because
8533740	8534740	there are competitors.
8534740	8538620	Like there was that whole FIFA streaming to YouTube thing that was not, that was Genkai
8538620	8539700	or whatever.
8539700	8542500	So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
8542500	8544780	Anyhow, uh, I want to move on to another story.
8544780	8546940	This had the game world talking this week.
8546940	8552460	This is huge news this week because a wired had a, uh, interview with Miyamoto and they
8552460	8557660	ran the headline is the headline quote Nintendo's Miyamoto stepping down, working on smaller
8557660	8561820	games and everybody took that and literally this around the rest of the internet and intent.
8561820	8563380	Uh, Miyamoto is quitting.
8563380	8568540	Nintendo Miyamoto is retiring because people read into that saying Miyamoto stepping down
8568540	8573140	and they kind of missed the hidden subtext and, and granted this headline is a little
8573140	8577900	bit sensationalistic, but that's the way headlines are kind of written to be, um, is that Miyamoto
8577900	8582580	stepping down from the Mario and Zelda games that he's been working on.
8582580	8588060	And and of course, Nintendo followed this up with an official quote where Nintendo is
8588060	8591460	basically like, no, no, no, Miyamoto is not retiring.
8591460	8595540	Uh, video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto's role in Nintendo is not changing.
8595540	8599160	He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts in discussing
8599160	8603480	his priorities at Nintendo in a media interview, Mr. Miyamoto explained how he is encouraging
8603480	8607180	the younger developers of the company to take more initiative and responsibility for developing
8607180	8608180	software.
8608180	8611300	And in fact, if you kind of go back to the original interview, here's what the wired
8611300	8616540	article says, quote, inside our office, I've been recently declaring I'm going to retire.
8616540	8617740	I'm going to retire.
8617740	8620860	I'm not saying that I'm going to retire from game development altogether.
8620860	8624720	What I mean by retiring is retiring from my current position.
8624720	8628720	What I really want to do is be in the forefront of game development once again, myself probably
8628720	8633040	working on a smaller project with even younger developers, or I might be interested in making
8633040	8637040	something that I can make myself by myself, something really small.
8637040	8641140	In other words, I'm not intending to start from things that require a five year development
8641140	8643740	time when all is said and done.
8643740	8646900	The internet was making this sound out to, uh, out to sound like bad news.
8646900	8649620	I think this is great news.
8649620	8651300	I think this is fantastic news.
8651300	8655820	I don't think Miyamoto should be taking all this time to work on Zelda and Mario games
8655820	8658580	when the, um, outlines are pretty much all laid out.
8658580	8662660	I mean, I think he should be there to give creative input and so forth, but, but that's
8662660	8663660	really it.
8663660	8667580	I mean, these, these things are in kind of capable hands now, you know, Miyamoto ain't
8667580	8668960	getting any younger.
8668960	8673460	He's been making games since the original NES, which just celebrated his 25th anniversary.
8673460	8678500	So I would like to see before he really does have to retire, I mean, all good things must
8678500	8684180	come to an end folks, someday Miyamoto is going to die.
8684180	8686340	So I hope it's not for a long time.
8686340	8691700	I'm not saying anything rude, you know, I'm just saying inevitably someday orange launch
8691700	8693900	radio will end.
8693900	8695780	It has to end at some point.
8695780	8699140	I'm not saying it's going to end next week and we're going to try to go as long as we
8699140	8700660	possibly can.
8700660	8704320	Someday grandma will grab Pogo to die.
8704320	8708020	But my point is, you know, maybe Miyamoto is like, do I really want to spend the rest
8708020	8712100	of my years in Nintendo working on another Zelda game?
8712100	8714700	You know, no, let's, let's, let's somebody else kind of do what they want with Zelda
8714700	8718900	and I want to try something new or I want to go back to the way we used to do it and
8718900	8723260	I'm going to try to do a game on myself because remember a lot of those Atari 2600 games back
8723260	8725940	in the day were programmed by like one guy.
8725940	8730980	So I would like, I think Miyamoto should spill out more of the contents of his brain for
8730980	8731980	us to consume.
8731980	8732980	You know what?
8732980	8739620	I'm stuck, but what if in that brain of his is the next Mario or the next Zelda?
8739620	8742420	I mean, aren't you all complaining at the same token?
8742420	8745500	I'm kind of sick of Nintendo putting out the same shit over and over again.
8745500	8748060	Then let Miyamoto develop something else.
8748060	8752160	This is fantastic news.
8752160	8754860	You get limited when you're stuck with the same thing over and over again.
8754860	8757540	It's the same reason why actors don't want to be typecast.
8757540	8759420	Don't you think?
8759420	8760420	Yes.
8760420	8761420	Same thing.
8761420	8764580	And of course now the chat room is running with this act deft.
8764580	8765940	Miyamoto will never die.
8765940	8767700	Don't say such cruel things, Rob.
8767700	8768700	Alpha-canonogram.
8768700	8769700	Miyamoto, die.
8769700	8770700	Kill the non-believer.
8770700	8772100	Well, I will say this.
8772100	8773100	I will say this.
8773100	8775740	This is a high compliment.
8775740	8780040	When the inevitable happens and Miyamoto passes away, think of it this way.
8780040	8786080	The work that he's created in some ways kind of defines this generation.
8786080	8788740	It defines a part of our culture.
8788740	8794140	And some of us could only be so lucky to have really made that kind of impact on the world.
8794140	8797600	I mean, Miyamoto made an impact on the world.
8797600	8802580	So in that sense, Miyamoto is immortal in that sense.
8802580	8805140	You want to take this to a weird deeper level.
8805140	8810020	In some ways, what we've done here at Orange Lounge Radio has had an impact and that makes
8810020	8812260	me feel really good about what we do every week.
8812260	8813260	Not nearly the impact.
8813260	8817880	I wouldn't say we've been a cultural revolution, but if you're tuning into this program and
8817880	8820940	spending your night with us, then we've had a little impact.
8820940	8822900	We've had a little impact.
8822900	8826380	So that's pretty cool.
8826380	8827380	Right Darsakra?
8827380	8829380	You haven't been listening to me at all, have you?
8829380	8833460	Yeah, no, I was, but I actually just had a Brush with Celebrity moment.
8833460	8834460	Oh?
8834460	8838360	One of my favorite people ever who's been on a reality show.
8838360	8841580	And I'm not a big reality show person, but I love MasterChef.
8841580	8848740	Ben Star, the guy who has fourth place on the season before last, just said that he
8848740	8850900	thought that my dish sounded delicious.
8850900	8855760	I asked him for advice when cooking a butternut squash.
8855760	8857700	Just because I was like, I'll ask a pro, why not?
8857700	8862540	And he seems to reply to people, but he gave me his method, but he gave it to me 20 hours
8862540	8863540	late.
8863540	8864980	So he's like, so what did you end up doing with it?
8864980	8869480	And I said, oh, I cooked it and it was still firm, so I saved it to microwave.
8869480	8873560	And I said, I mixed this, that, and the other, and he said, that sounds really yummy.
8873560	8876720	So I was like, I got a compliment.
8876720	8879920	It's always a little bit fun when a quote unquote celebrity, no matter if it's A-list
8879920	8881700	or F-list, kind of interacts with you on Twitter.
8881700	8882700	That's why Twitter is so popular.
8882700	8884340	Well, no, not on Twitter, on Facebook.
8884340	8886380	Well, still, same idea.
8886380	8890780	But he's actually one of the people that I learned the most from watching that show on
8890780	8893700	cooking dishes, because he's traveled and been to places.
8893700	8895140	Okay, let me put it this way.
8895140	8898660	When I followed George Takei on Twitter, he sent me a direct message.
8898660	8900380	You know, it's like, thanks for following me and all that stuff.
8900380	8901380	Like I know he didn't write it.
8901380	8903440	I know he's got people that, you know, probably do that stuff.
8903440	8904700	He's not sitting there at his computer all day.
8904700	8907360	He's got better things to do.
8907360	8910020	And probably a lot of that stuff he posts to Facebook too.
8910020	8913320	Like some of it might get his approval, but he probably has a whole team of people that
8913320	8914320	maintain his public image.
8914320	8917500	And I'll tell you this, they do a damn fucking good job.
8917500	8921920	George Takei's people team is probably some of the finest in the industry, if you think
8921920	8922920	about it.
8922920	8925540	I mean, like George Takei's stuff is all over Facebook.
8925540	8928020	His tweets get retweeted all the time.
8928020	8933220	He's like, he's even more legendary than Betty White in social media, dare I say it.
8933220	8936340	Which brings me back to the idea of, didn't we have a sitcom idea this week where it was
8936340	8938900	like George Takei and Julie Andrews raising you?
8938900	8944180	Yeah, no, I said, I said that I, that I wish that I, I love my family, but I wish that
8944180	8948340	I had been adopted by George Takei and Julie Andrews or, you know, if they were really
8948340	8953980	my parents and I would be half Japanese with an amazing singing voice, you know, and probably
8953980	8954980	raging lesbian.
8954980	8956980	All right, let's move on.
8956980	8958340	Just a few more news stories for you guys.
8958340	8959340	Dark Sakura.
8959340	8960340	Oh yeah.
8960340	8961340	I do have another story, don't I?
8961340	8962340	Yes, you do.
8962340	8965580	How about a little bit of technical comparison?
8965580	8973040	Batman, Arkham City, the PC versions and the console versions, they're actually saying
8973040	8980980	that they really, really wanted to bump it up and make it look really good.
8980980	8986960	They had it set to run for DirectX 11 so that it was as clean and perfect as it could even
8986960	8990620	though for the smoother gameplay, they said, keep it to nine as it would be comparable
8990620	8992420	with the consoles.
8992420	8998820	But they apparently just had it to look amazing for the PC players that had the best systems.
8998820	9002300	So I was looking at some of the comparisons on here.
9002300	9004500	And Arkham City's already a gorgeous game.
9004500	9005500	Good lord.
9005500	9006500	Yeah.
9006500	9011380	Well that, that at least makes the delay between versions a little more worth the wait if they've
9011380	9013220	managed to tweak it to look even better.
9013220	9016900	I mean, granted, you probably need the highest of high end systems to be able to really see,
9016900	9018780	but it's still pretty cool.
9018780	9023940	But see, they're showing it versus the PS3 and the PC, some of the difference in the
9023940	9027620	shading effect and the textures.
9027620	9036380	It actually, and I have to say, cause we have the PS3 one here, as clean as it was, I mean,
9036380	9043740	it's really hard to compare a console with a PC when the PCs are consistently upgradable.
9043740	9052780	You can get the best stuff for it, but as beautiful as the textures and the lighting
9052780	9058620	and everything in the PC one was, it actually really makes me appreciate the PS3 version
9058620	9065120	because it really is pretty close, even though, I mean, yeah, tech spec wise, the PC one will
9065120	9071600	blow it out of the water, but the PS3 version really keeps up.
9071600	9072600	It's a gorgeous game.
9072600	9073600	Absolutely gorgeous game.
9073600	9074600	Yours is best.
9074600	9078900	But there are also some other improvements too, just in the PC one, other than the higher
9078900	9086180	resolution textures, they actually, it's all the stuff that you see up close, like pores
9086180	9087500	and indentations under the skin.
9087500	9088500	You can see veins.
9088500	9094300	I mean, they really put a lot of effort into making it look realistic.
9094300	9095300	I want to go back to chat.
9095300	9099220	The chat room's a little bit delayed, but there was a great quote here from chat on
9099220	9100220	the Miyamoto thing.
9100220	9103540	I want to read this real quick here from Midori in our chat room at chat.orangesonshreddy.com.
9103540	9105580	I love your drinks.
9105580	9111020	He, meaning Miyamoto, will be immortal, but I understand that if I had the choice, I'd
9111020	9115820	want to be known for making the most favored characters over how many games I could develop
9115820	9118180	for a few loved characters.
9118180	9119540	That's a really good way to sum it up.
9119540	9122660	So I just wanted to throw that out there because that mirrors my thoughts very closely.
9122660	9126220	All right, just a couple of quick stories for you guys and then the Skype line is going
9126220	9127220	to open up.
9127220	9128220	So, Loki.
9128220	9130260	All right.
9130260	9133640	So this is neat, I guess.
9133640	9140060	They're going to be giving a little bit of bonuses for fans of Final Fantasy XIII-2 or
9140060	9141460	even the original Final Fantasy game.
9141460	9145100	If you play the original Final Fantasy XIII game and you have a game save, you're going
9145100	9150300	to be getting some special features, including special monster decorations and a higher success
9150300	9151300	rate at the games.
9151300	9152820	I guess they have a gambling area.
9152820	9157980	I wonder if it's anything like, what was that in Final Fantasy VII, like the golden something
9157980	9158980	or other.
9158980	9159980	I can't remember what it was called.
9159980	9164180	Time of lucky hit.
9164180	9167700	Also I guess they're saying that the game's going to be broken up in the episodes and
9167700	9170300	each episode will be about three hours long.
9170300	9174580	Also going to be adding an auto save system as well as the ability to save in different
9174580	9175900	places.
9175900	9181740	Plus there's going to be a new game plus mode that adds, I guess, unlockable items and also
9181740	9185340	new monster decorations as well.
9185340	9189900	And neat, I mean that extra stuff is good.
9189900	9193540	I know that they're going to be doing some DLC though for it and I think that's kind
9193540	9196460	of ridiculous as far as what they're adding with the DLC.
9196460	9201260	I think more monster decorations, but remember it's optional, you don't need to buy it.
9201260	9208340	Well that's good as long as it's extra frilly stuff and not necessary to the game's completion.
9208340	9210060	But the game's sounding better and better, I can't wait to play it.
9210060	9213740	I really need to actually finish the last chapter of Final Fantasy XIII.
9213740	9218100	I was digging through my bag the other day and I saw Final Fantasy XIII there, I'm like
9218100	9221140	oh yeah, I need to finish that.
9221140	9224140	By the way, chat room to the rescue on the gambling thing of Final Fantasy VII, Gold
9224140	9225140	Saucer.
9225140	9227380	Yeah, it is Gold Saucer.
9227380	9231420	Alright, and one more Final Fantasy related story for you guys this week and it has to
9231420	9233940	do with Final Fantasy XIV.
9233940	9234940	Guess what?
9234940	9240940	They are going to charge service fees for Final Fantasy XIV.
9240940	9242940	I'm not playing.
9242940	9246020	Final Fantasy XIV, here's the deal.
9246020	9249780	They will be implementing the fee change on January 6th.
9249780	9254660	This has been pushed back a little bit, it was supposed to start by now essentially.
9254660	9258960	So on January 6th they are going to start the new pricing structure.
9258960	9263660	So what will happen is that the subscription fees, this is weird, the basic service is
9263660	9272500	$6.99 for 30 days and then the real subscription fee when the new version starts will be $9.99
9272500	9274020	for 30 days.
9274020	9277140	That's kind of weird the way that's set up, but there you go.
9277140	9281060	And if you want extra characters, that's the other weird thing, it's $3 a character.
9281060	9285740	So it's definitely cheaper than $14.95 but still, I mean that monthly fee, it's going
9285740	9287940	to be very interesting to see the impact that has on the game.
9287940	9289500	I think it's going to kill it.
9289500	9292900	I think it has those diehard fans that still support it but now that they're going to ask
9292900	9295800	money out of pocket every month, that's going to be rough.
9295800	9297300	I know I won't pay for it.
9297300	9302700	I'll go back and check it out when version 2 launches or if there's some huge content
9302700	9306220	upgrade but yeah, I think Zethur summed it up in chat.
9306220	9308940	Well, there it goes Final Fantasy XIV.
9308940	9310740	Bye bye.
9310740	9313300	Nice knowing you.
9313300	9319060	Let's go to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9319060	9322260	I'm going to check the Twitter too to see if we have any tweets.
9322260	9325660	I forgot to ask for those earlier because I was so involved in the Mario Kart thing
9325660	9331060	earlier but I'll look for those if I can find them amongst the new Twitter because they've
9331060	9334020	changed the look of Twitter again.
9334020	9335220	Why?
9335220	9336220	Because they can.
9336220	9338220	Although I will say it's not terrible.
9338220	9342420	Alright, let's go to the Skype line.
9342420	9345860	Meanwhile while we wait for the Skype line, Loki, do we have last minute stories?
9345860	9348580	I'm sure there's got to be a few tonight because I think there were some big things I skipped
9348580	9349580	over, right?
9349580	9350580	Umm, maybe.
9350580	9358020	I didn't look them up so I'm trying to think here if there's anything really major that
9358020	9359540	I can think of off the top of my head.
9359540	9361380	Well, I have a couple tweets while you're looking alright.
9361380	9362380	Alright, sounds good.
9362380	9369660	Mishiro Chan, Mishiro Chan or Gamer Girl says, I just picked up the Oregon Trail game for
9369660	9371540	the Wii and it's pretty fun.
9371540	9374260	I'm working on doing a write up to post on site.
9374260	9375260	Awesome.
9375260	9376260	I would like to hear more about it.
9376260	9378320	I hope it's better than the Facebook one, that's for sure.
9378320	9382800	I think it looks, well, I think it looks very similar to the Facebook and the phone version
9382800	9383800	that they add out.
9383800	9388100	In fact, I would be surprised if it wasn't the exact same.
9388100	9390420	I hope it will not die of dysentery.
9390420	9395460	Umm, YYR tweets us saying, remember, boom!
9395460	9396700	And sends us a YouTube link.
9396700	9401460	Usually I don't play YouTube links on the show but I'm hoping that it's a link from
9401460	9404620	umm, uhh, Bungee Ferret Cat.
9404620	9407820	Oh no, this is from Magic Knight Ray Earth.
9407820	9408820	Cliff.
9408820	9409820	Amprecias.
9409820	9412580	Oh, I love these.
9412580	9416300	Mysterious Sepro lecture number three.
9416300	9420580	I've just mastered the skill known as the pulverizing bash.
9420580	9422080	Indeed.
9422080	9427980	By running to increase your speed, the power to throw yourselves increases as well.
9427980	9433220	You can destroy places with weak foundations or small cracks with incredible ease.
9433220	9440180	But, be sure to give yourself plenty of room to run so you can increase your speed.
9440180	9441180	That's right.
9441180	9444260	Make a good approach, start running and then boom!
9444260	9447380	That's all for today.
9447380	9448380	Yeah.
9448380	9449380	Let's go to the phones.
9449380	9450380	I love the voice acting in that game.
9450380	9451380	And then boom!
9451380	9452380	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9452380	9453380	Who's this?
9453380	9454380	Hey, it's Zether from the chat.
9454380	9455380	Hi.
9455380	9456380	Zether from the chat.
9456380	9457380	What's on your mind?
9457380	9458380	Oh, not much.
9458380	9462460	I enjoyed playing Mario Kart with you guys, it was pretty fun.
9462460	9464780	I know, Mario Kart's an awesome game.
9464780	9465780	Yeah.
9465780	9472380	Umm, well yesterday I recently beat umm, well yesterday I beat umm, Snatcher yesterday.
9472380	9473380	It was really fun.
9473380	9474380	Freakin' love Snatcher.
9474380	9476380	Gosh, that's old school.
9476380	9477380	Nice.
9477380	9482380	Yeah, it's, I, I didn't think I would be able to finish it, like to finish all of it, but
9482380	9487060	I finished like the second, by the time you finish the second act, the game pretty much
9487060	9493140	becomes like, pretty much just goes automatically for you, but there is this one final shooting
9493140	9497100	segment that's actually very difficult.
9497100	9504140	It was the umm, the super Insector things, and they start like swarming around the screen.
9504140	9509000	And then umm, I kept dying repeatedly at that part, and then umm, it came up to the, then
9509000	9513420	I didn't realize that there was a second part where you had to shoot Snatchers, and I died
9513420	9518560	during that, and it kicks you back to the first part again with the Insectors, so it's
9518560	9522880	a little annoying having to keep doing it over and over.
9522880	9525480	But I beat it, it was pretty good.
9525480	9528360	It's always a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a game.
9528360	9532620	It's one I haven't felt in a long time because I have such gamer ADD I never finish anything.
9532620	9538620	Yeah, I, I actually did finish umm, Saints Row the Third a couple, like a month ago I
9538620	9539620	think.
9539620	9541300	Now what'd you think of Saints Row the Third?
9541300	9543920	Cuz I just played it for the first time this week.
9543920	9545660	I think it was really good.
9545660	9552240	It was pretty over the top, insane, definitely, I, I preordered it on Steam, full price, and
9552240	9554440	I, I definitely got what I paid for.
9554440	9555880	It was really good.
9555880	9556880	Nice.
9556880	9560640	It's, I love, I love how over the top it is, what kind, did you make, did you try to make
9560640	9564840	a character who was kinda like you, or did you make a character who was over the top
9564840	9565840	too?
9565840	9571120	I actually downloaded a character from the umm, from like the online thing.
9571120	9575640	They had a guy who looked like Gabe Newell, so I used him for the whole game.
9575640	9576640	Nice.
9576640	9581280	And it was hilarious just seeing this guy running, who looks like Gabe Newell running
9581280	9585440	around like being all snarky and blowing stuff up.
9585440	9593320	It's like, oh, oh wow, Gabe Newell's blowing up a helicopter, now he's killing these furries
9593320	9595320	in this umm, game show.
9595320	9598240	That sounds like something Gabe Newell might actually do.
9598240	9599760	Yeah.
9599760	9600760	It was pretty good.
9600760	9601760	Awesome.
9601760	9604280	Well it sounds like I've barely scratched the surface of the game.
9604280	9605280	Furries on a game show?
9605280	9606920	I haven't come across this yet, so it sounds pretty awesome.
9606920	9611080	Yeah, it's the umm, it's one of the side missions you play in umm, Genki's little
9611080	9613760	ridiculous game show thing.
9613760	9618440	I keep doing the missions like one after another, should I just say screw it and kind of drive
9618440	9619440	around and look for stuff first?
9619440	9624320	No, because they're gonna take you through those, all the like uhh, diversions basically
9624320	9628600	by actually playing the missions because they kind of, it goes through the whole tutorial
9628600	9632280	mode a little long, but it's good because you've never played any of the games, so you
9632280	9635920	know, you don't know how to play insurance fraud or anything like that.
9635920	9636920	Right, right.
9636920	9642360	So umm, but they'll take you through like the Genki show and Tiger Escort and stuff
9642360	9643360	like that.
9643360	9644360	Oh yeah, that one's good.
9644360	9645360	I can only imagine.
9645360	9646640	The tank one is the best.
9646640	9651400	I think the tank one where you have to rack up the most umm, money and damage is the best
9651400	9656840	because you can literally just go through, just keep pressing forward, holding down both,
9656840	9661720	holding down both fire buttons for the minigun and the main cannon, you can pretty much just
9661720	9663320	keep racking up the points.
9663320	9664320	It's all about the fences.
9664320	9669160	No, my, my favorite thing so far has been the little computer that my chick picked up
9669160	9673080	and she can use it to just fire guided missiles at tanks on a whim.
9673080	9679760	Oh yeah, that's awesome, the umm, it's kind of like a umm, missile launch, yeah the missile
9679760	9680760	drop thing.
9680760	9683040	Yeah, it's like a little computer you use to launch missiles and I guess it's like a
9683040	9687160	regular weapon you can use to just launch guided missiles at your foes.
9687160	9688960	That's pretty impressive.
9688960	9692880	And I gotta say the environments, like I love the whole like downtown LA looking environment
9692880	9697760	is, it's very neon and I love purple so I'm glad it's the ganks color.
9697760	9701640	Just wait until you get to the Tron world, the Tron world is amazing.
9701640	9704800	I'm sure I'll have a huge boner over to the Tron world because I love Tron.
9704800	9708920	Yeah, it's pretty awesome, I was enjoying like every minute of it.
9708920	9709920	Awesome, awesome.
9709920	9714200	Alright well Zethyr, any other final thoughts to get out there before we let you go?
9714200	9718920	Not much, I finished Snatcher and I'm actually playing the MSX version like the, because
9718920	9720160	somebody translated it.
9720160	9721160	Old school Snatcher.
9721160	9726600	Yeah, even older than the Sega CD one so, and then I'm probably gonna go play Policenauts
9726600	9732080	which is the follow up of sorts and it got translated to you.
9732080	9734440	I have Policenauts on Playstation.
9734440	9735440	Check out the original Metal Gear.
9735440	9738000	Yeah, it's the one that got translated actually.
9738000	9739800	And the real Metal Gear 2 that's on MSX.
9739800	9744000	Well no, I mean I've got it in Japanese and it was a pain in the butt trying to play through
9744000	9745000	it in Japanese.
9745000	9746000	Oh yeah it is.
9746000	9747000	Yeah.
9747000	9748000	Lots of text.
9748000	9750600	Alright well Zethyr, enjoy your Kojima-thon, okay?
9750600	9751600	Alright.
9751600	9752600	Alright, later.
9752600	9753600	Later.
9753600	9758720	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, AkumaJP in chat says, human rights for furries
9758720	9759720	too.
9759720	9762960	Well you know what, if I'm not mistaken, you could make your character a furry and you
9762960	9764880	could just revenge of the furries.
9764880	9768800	So if you want to blow everything up as a furry, you have every right to do so and you
9768800	9773520	could lead this notorious gang of criminals if you want that everybody stops and asks
9773520	9774920	for the autograph.
9774920	9778600	So like, I just remember in the very beginning of the game, some girl asked for some guy's
9778600	9781680	autograph and then I walked up and she didn't want my autograph so I shot her.
9781680	9785800	I was like, how rude, bang.
9785800	9788240	Game makes me sound like a terrible person but it's really fun.
9788240	9791600	That's because you are a terrible person, heart.
9791600	9792600	Hey!
9792600	9794000	I'll shoot you too.
9794000	9797160	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
9797160	9798160	Alright.
9798160	9801160	More last minute stories-ish things going on over there.
9801160	9805760	Yeah they announced that the VGAs that they're doing, Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, it's gonna
9805760	9810960	blend I guess the first two Tony Hawk titles and be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and
9810960	9813120	PlayStation Network next year.
9813120	9815520	Gosh, the recent Tony Hawk games haven't been selling.
9815520	9816960	How can we get the game to sell again?
9816960	9819720	I know, let's go back to when the games did sell.
9819720	9822880	You know what, that's not a bad idea and it looked pretty good based on the trailer.
9822880	9827000	I liked Pro Skater, I thought that was pretty awesome so I would look forward to playing
9827000	9828000	this actually.
9828000	9829000	Alright, let's go to another call.
9829000	9831000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9831000	9833000	It's Legend of Zaku here.
9833000	9834000	Zaku, what's up?
9834000	9840040	Nothing much, just kicking back, making sure I stay calm and sane before tomorrow's work
9840040	9841040	week.
9841040	9842040	Well good luck.
9842040	9846040	But yeah, it's been a while since I called, so I got through actually.
9846040	9847040	It's been a little while.
9847040	9848040	What have you been playing?
9848040	9849040	What's new?
9849040	9855480	Let's see, Forza 4 having to tackle the wireless steering wheel that Microsoft released for
9855480	9858000	the 360.
9858000	9865880	But all in all it's been mostly that and just playing my PC, but nothing new on that end.
9865880	9867840	Do you use head tracking in Forza 4 at all?
9867840	9868840	Do you have Kinect?
9868840	9869840	I don't have a Kinect.
9869840	9871480	I don't have enough space in my room for a Kinect.
9871480	9875740	You could get one of those little Zoom things, but I kind of bought one and it kind of sucks
9875740	9876740	for me.
9876740	9877740	I didn't like it.
9877740	9880400	It's smaller than the dorm rooms I was in in college.
9880400	9882320	Well, you do live in New York City.
9882320	9885160	Yeah, but it's a house.
9885160	9892640	Anyways, I noticed yesterday, I know it's almost like gaming related, but one of the
9892640	9901160	best DDR freestylers in the country, you know, frequency, I know him in real life.
9901160	9905520	He had his little going away party yesterday and pretty much all the old school DDR players
9905520	9906520	came out.
9906520	9907520	Where's he going to?
9907520	9911160	Moving back to Long Island.
9911160	9914760	So yeah, that was pretty much me just getting drunk.
9914760	9920800	I think I should have gotten a DDR dollar bill into the mix, but I didn't even notify
9920800	9921800	him.
9921800	9922800	Oh.
9922800	9926120	How rude of us.
9926120	9930160	But anyways, shifting on real quick.
9930160	9935920	Video game awards were yesterday and I noticed that Battlefield 3 got shafted.
9935920	9940320	It came empty handed.
9940320	9944880	The way I see it is that the winners were pretty much like, I know they're picked by
9944880	9950760	the people, but boy do they have like, aside from Skyrim and Uncharted and Arkham actually
9950760	9957240	getting the words they deserve, they actually had the gall to put Modern Warfare 3, you
9957240	9960760	know, put them up on the pedestal for anything.
9960760	9964840	It's well, without getting into the whole Modern Warfare versus Battlefield thing, because
9964840	9968960	honestly I have no authority whatsoever to speak on that subject.
9968960	9974500	But just in general, it's a tough year for game awards and all that because there's so
9974500	9975880	much good shit this year.
9975880	9978080	It has really been a great year for games.
9978080	9979080	As it should be.
9979080	9981280	I mean, the systems have been out how long?
9981280	9984160	This is the years where they're really perfecting these systems.
9984160	9987840	I expect that next year should kick a lot of ass, too.
9987840	9989840	I mean, yeah, you're right.
9989840	9992880	Mass Effect 3 is like, what, a month away from now?
9992880	9993880	That's right.
9993880	9995800	Yeah, those games aren't afraid to release in January.
9995800	9997840	Yeah, of course.
9997840	10002480	They have very little competition for movies since that's a dumping ground for those films
10002480	10003480	anyways.
10003480	10007400	Yeah, it's a smart time to release a game.
10007400	10013800	I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yeah, this was a pretty good year for video gaming,
10013800	10014800	you know, in recent memory.
10014800	10017240	Oh yeah, pretty much so.
10017240	10024080	And hopefully next year, whatever they release, whatever they come out with, at that point
10024080	10028520	they're gonna start, you know, I'm more concerned about Nintendo.
10028520	10032640	Like they better start pulling rabbits out of their hat to replace their aging Wii.
10032640	10034480	Well, Wii U next year.
10034480	10035480	And now it's...
10035480	10040600	Yeah, if they can pull it off, if the rumors aren't true that their dev units are even,
10040600	10042760	are just like, not even up to par yet.
10042760	10047840	Well, keep in mind too, 3DS, thanks to the two strong releases, has gained a lot of steam,
10047840	10050320	which you know, I think we all saw coming.
10050320	10053760	Like you know, we knew they had to pull it out this holiday season and I think they've
10053760	10056480	succeeded to an extent with the two big releases.
10056480	10060960	I don't know what the final word is on how much it's sold, but I think they're saying
10060960	10063640	already it sold more than the DS did in its first year.
10063640	10069280	Now granted, it's a little bit apple to oranges because, you know, the 3DS should have the
10069280	10076360	DS's inertia to piggyback on, but you know, I think all in all, the 3DS is not going away
10076360	10077680	anytime soon.
10077680	10083220	Right, and then obviously it still has to contend with the Vita and then all the new
10083220	10085840	powerful smartphones are coming out within the next year.
10085840	10088760	I kind of think there's room for both the 3DS and the Vita.
10088760	10092240	I don't think they're going to bite from each other that much.
10092240	10096540	What about the third one, the mobile game market?
10096540	10100600	The fact that the smartphones out there are pretty much not only matching, but exceeding
10100600	10104120	their specs.
10104120	10113600	I have yet to play a game on a cell phone that also exists on a 3DS or Vita or any handheld
10113600	10115440	system that outshines it.
10115440	10121680	I wonder if Angry Birds would count since they already have it on PSP.
10121680	10123400	I'm not big on Angry Birds.
10123400	10126760	It's not to say mobile phone games are bad because there's a lot of good ones out there,
10126760	10131560	but most mobile phone games are kind of developed for mobile phones and they kind of, like,
10131560	10137040	the handheld game and mobile phones are kind of two separate worlds for me, but I get how
10137040	10139440	the two can cannibalize from each other as well.
10139440	10143320	I get how mobile phone is kicking Nintendo in the pants a little bit.
10143320	10145600	Why do you think they're...
10145600	10150440	Because Angry Birds is 99 cents and Mario Kart's 40.
10150440	10155120	I mean, alright, on one hand you have a system that's basically, you're right, it's touch
10155120	10156120	screen.
10156120	10162240	It's the best thing for hardcore gamers, but at the end of the day, they have, you know,
10162240	10167440	the platforms that they're running on, not only iPhone and Android, they're just, like,
10167440	10171000	they're getting out these systems for about the same price, but it's something that you're
10171000	10175420	going to carry with every day and going to use in an emergency, in addition to just playing
10175420	10178680	Angry Birds or any other, you know, game right now.
10178680	10184840	Like, even me, for example, I bought, like, SimCity for 10 cents today from the Android
10184840	10188320	market when they had that little sale, and I actually, I'm kicking myself because I missed
10188320	10192000	out on Minecraft earlier last week.
10192000	10194680	Mirror's Edge was free on iOS this weekend, by the way.
10194680	10200480	I don't know if it still is, I grabbed it when it was, so yay me.
10200480	10204720	But it's like, there are certain games I would play on the Android market, it's just a matter
10204720	10213000	of like, the ones that I'm willing to shell out money for, and those are pretty much like,
10213000	10214000	they're rare.
10214000	10218120	Like, from Angry Birds and Tap Tap, it's like, if they had something like SimCity or maybe
10218120	10226000	like a strategy game where you move around units, not like a castle defense game, but
10226000	10231680	something where you're just like, like a Starcraft or a Command and Conquer clone, then I could
10231680	10234000	definitely see myself playing that on the subways.
10234000	10235000	All right.
10235000	10238920	All right, well, Zaku, I gotta wrap up, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your
10238920	10239920	call.
10239920	10240920	Yeah, definitely.
10240920	10241920	All right, take care, buddy.
10241920	10242920	Have a good night.
10242920	10243920	You too.
10243920	10247400	I'm gonna do it for the phone lines tonight, because we're well after midnight on the East
10247400	10250320	Coast now, so I think we need to wrap up the show, so sorry to those who didn't get through,
10250320	10254800	but please consider sending us an email, make DarkSakura work for next week.
10254800	10257560	Hey, I work really hard all the time.
10257560	10262960	One eight, it's, excuse me, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com.
10262960	10267040	Quickly with these last few tweets, and then Loki left the room for a minute, but we'll
10267040	10271920	get him to do the last few last minute stories.
10271920	10277560	Tigerclaw wanted to send us a link that talks about layoffs at THQ's uDraw division.
10277560	10280440	Yep, it looks like some layoffs have happened over there.
10280440	10285440	30 employees were laid off on Friday, and layoffs are never good news, but at the same
10285440	10289120	time, it sounds like they might have put too many eggs in the basket of uDraw, because
10289120	10293560	I think it was, like, doing really well at first, but it's really funny.
10293560	10295320	I went to a family event today.
10295320	10301240	My grandma's 95th birthday was today, so happy birthday to my grandma, of course, but some
10301240	10305400	of my family was there, including, like, you know, some people that don't play a lot of
10305400	10308600	games, but like families, you know, they're like, they don't really watch a lot of TV,
10308600	10312600	but they're like, yeah, we own a Wii, and they actually mentioned, she actually said,
10312600	10318240	oh, we just bought last Christmas this uDraw tablet, but we never play it, so it's kind
10318240	10322720	of one of those, you know, oops, the inertia wasn't strong enough to keep the uDraw thing
10322720	10328400	going, so, ouch, yep, so there it went, goodbye.
10328400	10335520	And from Rama tweets us, on the hooves of the popular cartoon, we have My Little Pony
10335520	10336880	Fighting is Magic.
10336880	10341200	I don't know how I feel about your My Little Pony obsession these days, but sure enough,
10341200	10347200	at main6.com, they have this little trailer for My Little Pony Fighting Game.
10347200	10356040	You know what, I used to watch the original My Little Pony.
10356040	10358440	These new ones just look derpy.
10358440	10361080	Well, they do have a character named Derpy, actually.
10361080	10363720	Yeah, but I mean, everyone looks derpy.
10363720	10368960	All right, one more tweet, I'm gonna sneak in one more tweet here from Ziba.
10368960	10374000	I like Ziba, and she's psychic, because she knew from my teaser tweets, she knew about
10374000	10375960	the whole Umlaut thing, she guessed it.
10375960	10380200	Ziba says, O-L-R, I recently downloaded Snoopy Street Fair on the App Store.
10380200	10381200	It's really fun.
10381200	10383560	If you are a Snoopy or Peanuts fan, get it.
10383560	10384560	I like Snoopy.
10384560	10388440	I wonder if it's like an action-y game or a puzzle game, I'll have to find out more
10388440	10389880	about it.
10389880	10392800	So there you go, that's gonna do it for tweets tonight, let's see if there's any other last
10392800	10393800	minute stories.
10393800	10394800	Loki?
10394800	10400400	Uh, yeah, there's actually one thing here, well, a couple things.
10400400	10406880	First off, Q Entertainment has revealed 99 Nights Online.
10406880	10413760	So if you want a game that's kind of like, it's not exactly like 99 Nights, the regular
10413760	10423080	one that's sort of like a Dynasty Warriors knockoff almost, but this is a 2D action MMO.
10423080	10426300	It's interesting that this game refuses to go anywhere, yet we have such a hard time
10426300	10428240	getting Xenoblade over here, just saying.
10428240	10434000	It looks very much like, I don't know, like a lot of the 2D games that come over from
10434000	10439520	like Vanillaware and stuff like that, Neat, I guess, I don't know if that's actually coming
10439520	10444460	out over here though, I think that's only in Japan, but pretty cool.
10444460	10455960	And then, I mean, this is just annoying, but apparently there's been a quote from Capcom,
10455960	10462760	Christian Svensson, who is the Vice President of Strategic Planning and Marketing Development,
10462760	10472320	of course, commenting on Mega Man Legends 3, saying that, you know, what was the actual
10472320	10481560	quote here, that Mega Man is still a key brand for them, and that, you know, I guess basically
10481560	10490640	promising that there are fans that, no, there will be a Mega Man game possibly coming out.
10490640	10494240	They're considering Mega Man's future, so...
10494240	10500520	How nice of you to give it some thought, to take pittance on us commoners, to allow us
10500520	10502480	an audience with the king.
10502480	10506360	We're considering it, even though there's this big fan campaign to get another game,
10506360	10509880	we're considering, you know, being nice and giving you...
10509880	10512920	How bad do you want it, boys?
10512920	10519560	Seriously, and with that, as much as Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome, I can't support
10519560	10523800	that kind of thing, so I don't know if I'd buy it.
10523800	10525480	I don't know.
10525480	10526480	And then...
10526480	10530680	It's a shame how that has all been ruined, but anyway.
10530680	10536880	Now, I'm sure you're aware of Just Dance and how it's a popular franchise, and a lot of
10536880	10541760	these smaller developers out there like to, you know, knock off this game and put out
10541760	10544000	their own dancing game.
10544000	10550840	So one of these companies, Oxygen Games, I believe, or OG International, which sounds
10550840	10557920	a little bit funnier, they have a game called Get Up and Dance, and it's really hilarious.
10557920	10566560	Actually, I got to show you, I forgot to pull up the other screenshot, but basically, the
10566560	10571880	game looks almost exactly, I mean, straight down to the art style like Just Dance 3.
10571880	10577920	But anyways, there was this court case from Ubisoft suing the company, saying that, you
10577920	10585480	know, you guys can't release this because this is violating copyright, and basically
10585480	10588720	you're just creating a game that's exactly the same as ours.
10588720	10590560	And apparently, though, the judge...
10590560	10593560	Wait, wait, did you say the game is called Get Up and Dance?
10593560	10594560	Get Up and Dance.
10594560	10595880	Because there's a total Bimani joke in there.
10595880	10597880	Did you get it?
10597880	10612760	Anyway, so the court, though, has allowed, because Ubisoft, one of the things they wanted
10612760	10618440	to do was put a temporary restraining order on the publisher to not be able to put this
10618440	10619440	game out.
10619440	10622040	So they have been denied.
10622040	10626240	Ubisoft cannot restrain the release of this game.
10626240	10629880	It's supposed to be published in North America on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
10629880	10633560	Of course, you know, the PlayStation 3 being the move version.
10633560	10638960	But yes, the game looks exactly, I mean, straight down to the artwork exactly like Just Dance.
10638960	10645160	Of course, it will not sell as well as Just Dance.
10645160	10651120	Alright, that's it for last minute stories.
10651120	10654640	Alright, like, there's at least three people who get the joke.
10654640	10657840	At least, I can count at least three people in chat who should understand that joke.
10657840	10658840	At least.
10658840	10659840	Alright.
10659840	10664680	Anyhow, that's going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
10664680	10666080	Aw, sad face.
10666080	10669960	Alright, but thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.
10669960	10670960	We really appreciate it.
10670960	10671960	We appreciate the support.
10671960	10672960	We do.
10672960	10673960	We're com...
10673960	10674960	Yes, we do.
10674960	10675960	Girl.
10675960	10677040	We're commercial free.
10677040	10678040	We appreciate it.
10678040	10681220	All we ask, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
10681220	10682960	Help us spread through word of mouth.
10682960	10684920	We really appreciate it.
10684920	10687800	Now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
10687800	10689000	Dark Soccer, we'll start you tonight.
10689000	10690000	Your final thought.
10690000	10695080	Um, I really have an obsession with fab.com lately, but I can't afford anything there
10695080	10698000	except for my Helveta cards.
10698000	10703880	My final thought is, um, I won at least one piece of tier 13 Looking for Raid by this
10703880	10705280	time next week.
10705280	10707320	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10707320	10712120	My final thought is I've been looking for some good cage match songs and I found one.
10712120	10714560	All right, that's going to do it.
10714560	10716280	Thank you guys once again for listening to our show.
10716280	10719080	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
