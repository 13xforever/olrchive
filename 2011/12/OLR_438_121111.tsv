13966	19469	Tonight, December 11th, 2011, an official Xbox Live app shows up on Apple devices.
19950	26574	One of the Operation Rainfall games is announced for release in Europe, and Metal Gear meets Bayonetta in a new game trailer.
31598	38700	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38800	45422	We are live tonight with the 438th episode of our show on this December the 11th of 2011.
45822	53365	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she always does week in and week out, say hello to one of my co-hosts, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53685	54245	Roar.
54505	55345	Roar, how are you doing?
55865	56365	Roar.
56466	57826	You are a beast tonight.
58428	59569	I am rawr.
60169	61969	Now you're a sexy beast.
62170	63330	I'm always a sexy beast.
63370	64070	What are you talking about?
64651	67732	Except, you know, I'm really not.
67892	70593	Talking about your outfit on Thursday, which we'll get to in a minute.
70653	71993	You were a little bit of a sexy beast.
72053	72834	I like that outfit.
72854	74474	You were rocking the flower in your hair.
75015	78176	My makeup got all screwed up by the end of the night.
78356	80218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
95536	109997	and the fast food choice for tonight is McDonald's which does not service an official endorsement of the program I am not endorsing McDonald's that's for sure I've been actually trying to shy away from McDonald's but the problem is
111398	115402	On the way to the show, it's like, okay, you've got Carl's Jr., Burger King, and McDonald's.
116242	117503	And Carl's Jr.
117544	118745	had a line of seven cars.
119145	120346	I didn't want to go to Burger King.
120366	124670	I just decided not to go to Burger King because it's kind of hard to get into that parking lot and out of that parking lot.
125991	127592	These are real problems, people.
127792	129894	And I had Burger King for the last two days.
131315	132997	But they're Chef's Choice Burger, man.
133077	134117	It's good shit.
134138	134558	Yeah.
134858	135699	That is some good stuff.
136059	137900	This, however, not good stuff.
138020	141682	This would be the double quarter pounder that they made completely weird.
141802	141982	What?
142042	142602	No McRib?
143703	145484	Dude, the McRib is nasty, okay?
145564	146104	I'm sorry.
146184	147965	McRib is not... No, I know.
147985	150327	The McRib is nasty, but it's all everyone ever talks about.
150347	152428	Have you ever read the nutritional information on that?
152748	153188	No, thank you.
153228	154509	That's because there isn't any.
154669	155209	Ha ha.
155550	156750	No, it's there.
156810	157891	It's just not very nutritional.
158431	163116	All right, look, believe it or not, we're a podcast about video games and live show, not just food.
163776	164897	But let me introduce the chatters.
164957	169382	I have to introduce, of course, our chat room, the lovely folks that join us week in and week out live.
169682	176749	Because, of course, we are live at All Games Radio, which we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
177149	183275	And if you want to join us in the chat room, just point your browsers to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
183755	213210	or of course if you have an IRC client you can get on that way too by connecting to the Game Surge Network and it's Channel Orange Lounge but most people just prefer the easy way out so there you go choose whatever way you want to do but come talk with us and some folks in there are talking about retweeting the show status good idea thank you for helping to promote the show appreciate it and then MPRA2 is saying well back to Battlefield 3 sorry OLR I gotta unlock fire extinguisher for my jets so I guess we lost out to Battlefield tonight that makes me sad
213877	215418	A lot of people have been playing Battlefield.
215638	218219	I always go on to see what everyone else is playing.
218899	220419	Very tempted a lot of times to see Saints Row.
220439	223180	I'm like, could go play some Saints Row.
224141	228362	Skyrim is... I need to do meaningless tasks in Skyrim.
228382	233684	Well, I was going to say, no matter which friends list we're talking about, on my 360, everybody's playing Skyrim.
233784	236065	On my PlayStation 3, everybody's playing Skyrim.
236085	236685	Like, it really...
237185	239026	No, last night it was all Battlefield 3.
239347	242629	Do you know what consistently, again, between the two systems is number one, though?
242729	244910	What I see people on more than anything else on the systems?
245631	246731	The answer's easier than you think.
247312	247932	Modern Warfare 3?
248092	248512	Netflix.
249533	249873	Ah, yeah.
250654	252675	Even though... Well, let's talk about this a little bit.
252815	253936	Let's get into games a little bit.
255177	258179	Talk about the new Xbox remodel that happened this week.
258199	261501	Because, you know, they launched the new Xbox dashboard.
261521	262061	What do they call it?
262081	262582	The Xbox...
263857	264417	Dashboard?
264437	265198	Is that what it's called?
265258	266138	Experience?
266698	267198	I don't know what it is.
267218	268279	It's technically a dashboard.
268479	270920	So, I guess what they're trying to do is they're trying to... Call it boring.
271260	276682	Well, they're trying to integrate Kinect more into it, you know, and have it be that way, but... Whoopty shit.
277342	277702	Here it is.
278102	278502	Long story short.
278522	280723	Look, if you have a 360, you've probably already seen it.
280763	284644	You know, the entire internet was trying to download it that day, and it was delayed, etc., etc.
284664	286285	Everybody's seen it by now, but I gotta be honest.
287145	287305	Eh.
287966	288846	Like, it's prettier.
289306	289966	I'll give it that.
290307	290847	The ads...
291823	293084	Kind of stick out a lot more.
293124	294344	I noticed that too right away.
294965	297846	But it's really built for the Kinect.
298587	302809	And I just think it's kind of... Not a big fan of it.
302929	306311	I mean, you know, the Kinect's cool and all, but I don't want it shoved down my throat.
306371	310874	And I kind of feel like this new Xbox redesign kind of really shoves the Kinect down your throat.
310934	317257	And like, I don't know about you guys, but in my apartment, the Xbox is not always that... Or Kinect and all that is not always that responsive.
317277	317958	And I don't want to...
318758	318959	Use it.
318979	325888	I mean, it's fine if I light things up to play Dance Central or whatever, but in my low-lit apartment otherwise, I don't like to try and use Kinect.
325928	335542	I understand people think it's cool, and by people I mean Microsoft, think it's cool to have voice commands and Kinect commands and stuff like that for...
336522	354831	all the stuff in there you can wave your hand back and forth to like scroll through the pages or or I can take less time a fraction of a second less to move my thumb slightly to the left or right on my analog stick to do the exact same thing um it's just like
356727	370293	I don't understand... I mean, yeah, you gotta support the Kinect, and that's fine that you wanna add more connectivity to, you know, the dashboard, but... I just... I think it's unnecessary.
370594	374575	I mean, and it's kind of a step backwards for a lot of things.
374635	376716	It made a lot of stuff a lot harder to find.
376756	378257	I mean, there's pros and there's cons.
378397	383500	On the one hand, it's really easy, like, if I think of an old game that's on my Xbox that I wanna play, like, let's say, um...
384640	386823	Xbox, Bing, Magic the Gathering.
386863	390066	I can go play that game, which maybe I haven't played in a long time.
390086	397594	But otherwise, kind of digging through my collection is a lot of key presses to get to because you have to kind of scroll over.
398215	403521	It does kind of like that it's a crossbar but not really thing where it's weird.
405603	406144	I don't really like it.
406164	409649	I mean, it's prettier, but in practicality, it's kind of an annoyance.
410110	411612	I think a lot of stuff's harder to find.
412393	414777	Although you have Bing if you know what you're looking for.
416272	417893	Bing does not search the internet.
417933	425298	I think a lot of people assumed because Bing is like a competitor to Google that you'd be able to like Bing, Orange Lounge Radio, and you'd get taken to our website.
425358	425938	But now, no.
425978	428360	If you try to Bing Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think you get anything at all.
429120	432703	The icons that used to be up on the marketplace have been long gone.
433303	438506	The all-games icons they took down when the avatars launched.
440227	441328	You can still use them if you have them.
442349	443510	Rob, you made me laugh just now.
443650	443850	Why?
443930	444290	What'd I do?
444610	445491	Magic the Gathering.
446277	446918	Magic the Gathering
465197	465557	Outro Music
483939	486880	This update is no longer available, and it clits the game.
487700	498822	So this game I bought for $10 maybe a year ago, like I can't play anymore because they decided to remove the update, is like this trying to force me into the 2012 version of the game?
498842	499382	I don't even know.
500443	501683	That kind of irritated me.
502003	506424	Technically, we could get you the update, but I mean, it's still a pain in the ass to do that.
506784	512331	technically meaning download it from the internet, but I shouldn't have to do that, right?
512772	513472	It should just work.
514213	516977	So anyway, I kind of think the new Xbox experience is a little eh.
517257	523986	The whole reason I brought it up in the first place, going back to chat, and chat reminded me of this, is that they took out the party feature from Netflix.
524486	525967	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
550703	551803	They're kind of having to adapt to it.
551843	557945	So I'm thinking the movie studio is probably pressured into removing the party feature because it never showed up on any other console.
557965	561085	Yeah, because if you think about it, oh, I want to watch a movie with my friends.
561285	564186	Well, if you want to watch a movie with your friends, you're going to go buy the damn DVD.
564366	566267	That's what the movie studio is thinking probably.
566327	568227	Yeah, it's a little weird.
568247	573148	But there were some people that really liked that feature that it got taken away.
573168	576149	I didn't realize how many people were using it until I saw the QQing on my Twitter.
576849	577029	So...
578206	582328	Well, and then they made indie games harder to find also.
584457	589881	I just, you know, download whatever I'm going to watch and then watch it with a couple of friends on AIM.
590761	592002	But I mean, I guess it was the same thing.
592662	600207	Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I really want to watch games, I mean, technically technically, couldn't I, and I don't know if this is possible, maybe the chat can help me out here.
600627	609933	Couldn't I open up like the Xbox party and open up like one of those cross-game chat dealies and then go into Netflix and say, okay, on the count of three, press the start button.
610074	610874	One, two, three, start.
611534	613776	Or because it wouldn't really work because people's
614297	616541	I don't know, Mike.
616962	620548	It would just be wait five seconds before commenting or something?
620588	620929	I don't know.
621496	623097	DarkSakura.com
649051	649311	Ooh, me!
667170	668632	I don't have negative stuff to say.
668692	669712	No, I had a great time.
670153	676218	And so I'm sure those of you that watch the video feed, and if you haven't seen the video feed yet, you can check it out.
676278	686506	It is archived at umlaut.org, and it takes you to the little Ustream archived presentation, which was part of GameSpots, I guess, providing the bandwidth or what have you for that whole thing.
687546	694330	You know, there were some audio problems in the beginning, which, you know, just my luck, my first live shot's gonna go wrong or something like that.
694390	707117	So it was very nerve-wracking, but at the end I was feeling a lot better with the interviews and so forth, and people were very complimentary, so I was very happy and got a lot of people to come out and donate, which is the most important thing of all, of course, is the donation.
707657	713400	But I just wanted to say, you know, despite all the technical things that happened, you
713920	714321	and DarkSakura.com
731724	746760	but having the very professional people from the AV Society that were helping to put it on was such a relief because like truly and I'm not just saying this to kiss ass because I truly truly feel this way like everybody was super professional and just super awesome
747020	748101	And were people stressed out?
748161	748481	Sure.
748601	750162	I mean, there was a lot to get stressed out about.
750202	753204	Some guests weren't there and some video clips weren't around.
753244	754085	You know, it stings.
754265	757907	We get stressed out at OLR when the internet goes down and we can't do our show like we planned.
758208	759188	You know, things happen.
759488	764312	But it's kind of the way that people kind of react to those change and still interact with each other.
764372	767053	I just really felt there was still like a really high level of professionalism.
767093	770316	So I just got to give kudos to all those people that put it on.
770356	771376	I mean, was it scary?
771717	771997	Yes.
772437	774018	But was it rewarding?
774298	774879	Absolutely.
775219	775639	Absolutely.
775699	776860	So I had a fantastic time.
777360	778101	And you were cute.
778781	779322	Your hat was cute.
779342	779662	Thank you.
779682	780723	You've got something on you.
780903	781163	Thank you.
781183	782864	I have a little thread.
784606	786647	Yeah, so a co-worker went shopping with me the other night.
786667	788028	We bought an all new outfit.
788609	789990	So I'm like, oh, excuse to go shopping.
790010	792232	I like that shirt, but I understand Alan's stealing it from you.
792272	793072	Yes, yes.
793132	798156	That's what happens is that, you know, I buy a shirt and then, you know, Alan says, no, I want that shirt.
798316	798636	Steal.
798897	798997	No.
800097	804601	I'm wearing the shirt that I bought for that night, but I really just bought it to wear under that, my hoodie.
804621	804701	Okay.
806125	811649	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, no catfights backstage?
812090	813551	No, no, it's all in the name of charity.
813671	814471	Actually, I gotta say this.
814491	828701	This is the cool thing is that, you know, and I was mentioning this a little bit on the call on Bobby's show is that, you know, one of the other co-hosts was really well known on Twitch TV, yet it was streamed on Ustream, and you had people behind the scenes from GameSpot and IGN, but you know what?
828721	829342	At the end of the day,
829662	830122	Who cares?
830462	830902	Who cares?
831022	831663	It's for charity.
832083	836304	Like, you know, day jobs and all those allegiances and so forth are one thing and the communities we're into.
836324	839145	But at the end of the day, it isn't about us and about our ego.
839505	844006	Everybody really did truly check those in at the door because it was about the charity.
844706	849007	And I honestly, the people I was working with anyway, I don't think have ego anyway.
849067	850728	So, you know, I didn't sense that at all.
851008	857490	I ran into one thing that I'm really not going to discuss, but I think I did a very fluid sidestep of drama.
857510	858450	Yeah.
859811	860891	You know why I say fluid?
861451	862112	Because I drank.
863192	866614	Anytime you get a group of nerds together, it's always bound to be a hilarious time.
867234	872136	Anyhow, going to our other chatroom, chat.orange.com, Tigerclaw says, everyone loved your beard, Rob.
872436	881000	You know, Tigerclaw, I seem to remember you specifically thought the beard was weird at first, so I'm glad you've come full circle and come to embrace the beard that I started a couple months ago.
881080	881821	I appreciate it.
883602	884022	Let's see.
884922	888024	Going back to our chat room, Actdeft says, I did watch Umlaut Live.
888104	889544	I did see the last part of the pre-show.
889564	890025	Well, thank you.
890665	891225	It was good times.
891345	891985	It was really good times.
892005	896167	And they actually, it wasn't just the pre-show they broadcast live, but they broadcast the whole thing, all the bands.
896487	897148	And I gotta say,
897808	901270	Just hilarious, imaginative bands.
901330	910196	And if you missed us talking about what Umlaut is on last week's show, in a nutshell, people pay money to play rock band on an actual concert stage.
910517	912058	And so, of course, they go all out.
912138	914139	And all the money goes to the Child's Play charity.
914419	915380	I liked the Aperture band.
915825	919648	Oh yeah, the one that was all dressed up like Devo, the Devoid or whatever, that was phenomenal.
919928	933337	And even that very first band that came out after the introduction, they were all dressed up like Harry Potter characters, and they did You Oughta Know for whatever reason, but I was like, they're Gryffindor kids singing You Oughta Know, it's funny.
934457	938280	But it's great, everybody went all out.
938320	943524	I'll tell you this, here's something you didn't hear on the pre-show, literally, because the mic was dead.
944344	945825	The First Guy I'm Interviewing Gay Riot
960430	961190	Thank you for watching!
982717	1004391	there's something you missed out on by there not being audio that was that was a fun interview I feel sorry for that guy they were all good sports these people completely pulled like for real like I will admit like the raffle fairy Amanda she's a good friend of mine so of course I wanted to bring her on but a lot of those people were complete strangers and really good sports and some great interviews I had a fun time
1005293	1006194	I had a good time, too.
1006514	1006774	Anyhow.
1006814	1014879	Because I was helping to test out the free play setup, which I set up half of it before my hand said, oh, no.
1015439	1017980	You were singing a lot of songs in there before they opened the doors.
1018260	1018741	I heard you.
1019281	1025705	Well, I always have to, I can't use earplugs because they always make my ears hurt more for some reason.
1026345	1028766	But I have this fear of being out of key.
1029907	1047365	which people who know me know why I have that problem so I was trying to make sure everything was you know set up and finally there was this one dude in there who was a super cool and we played a band on the run and that made me happy because anyone who appreciates Paul McCartney in the wings is cool in my book
1048245	1051266	All right, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungerated.com.
1052146	1056128	Tigerclaw says, Rob, it would have been great if you got on stage and sang some of the songs.
1056488	1062150	You know, I would have done it, but I wasn't sure if I could because of the other stuff I was doing.
1062250	1066731	But I think in retrospect, I probably still would have just been able to buy a band spot and been on at the end.
1067071	1067832	So maybe next year.
1067892	1068932	Like, I'm not opposed to it.
1069012	1069932	It's for a good cause.
1069972	1070613	It's a great thing.
1070833	1072713	We bought raffle tickets.
1073173	1074514	Alan and I won a raffle prize.
1075575	1085026	I haven't got to play it yet because we had to leave before it was over because keep in mind San Francisco is a two-hour drive and I had to work the next day with a morning meeting.
1085547	1089572	So we won the raffle prize late, but we won some fishing game on the Wii.
1090660	1091280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1113507	1122493	Some of these expensive systems we talk about, like 3DS and some of this stuff, even if they're too young to enjoy this stuff, Child's Play goes so far to get coloring books and things like that.
1122513	1124835	Remember, this is just a really tough time of year.
1125796	1131119	A lot of kids sometimes don't easily have access to that stuff when they're going through a really hard time.
1131159	1132680	So Child's Play kind of helps deliver that.
1132740	1133701	So just think about that.
1133721	1134641	But no stuffed animals.
1135822	1136863	It's actually another thing.
1137243	1142567	If you're going to donate a toy, do not donate a stuffed animal because they do carry germs.
1143267	1143868	DarkSakura.com
1166462	1167883	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1186852	1190756	No, I was going to go in and set it up and then I was just not feeling well.
1191056	1194119	We had a busy beginning of the week because I know you had a lot of rush design projects.
1194459	1196381	I had a lot of design to do.
1196841	1199404	I had Umlaut.
1199884	1205870	I had the American River Review release party, which by the way, the 2012 American River Review is out.
1206851	1211575	If you go to arc.losrios.edu and go to the bookstore link, you can order a copy.
1211815	1216099	So if our international audience wants to see what the local community college here at OLR does...
1231594	1234055	and Culinary Recipes, which I laid out.
1234215	1235636	Look at you showing your college pride.
1236056	1236436	I love it.
1236496	1237316	I'm pretty proud of it.
1237396	1237917	You should be.
1238097	1241578	Well, ARC is like the biggest junior college in California.
1241658	1243799	Is there any video gaming content in the magazine?
1245561	1247442	Not quite, but there's plenty of pop culture.
1247682	1250203	Maybe that should be something you should think about for next year.
1250844	1251324	Just saying.
1252224	1255646	Well, I'm hoping next year we actually get some of the 3D modelers putting their stuff in.
1256207	1257087	Okay, well that's cool.
1257507	1263350	Because when I took the 3D class, I did a turret from Portal.
1264571	1265171	I remember that.
1265191	1266732	That was a really cute little thing you did.
1267057	1271760	And other people have done different... One person did a Game Boy Advance.
1271820	1276163	So I'm saying you get... There's definitely references.
1276263	1280706	I mean, a lot of the stories in there, there's definitely a few geeks doing the writing.
1281807	1283648	But I think that it's worthwhile.
1283688	1288651	So really that's what my... That and Umlaut have really been what's taken up the bulk of my week.
1288731	1291913	Not really specifically gaming, but...
1293474	1297178	It's been two worthy things that I'm proud to have been involved in this week.
1309830	1318073	And I swear, I waste so much time doing meaningless tasks like item management and what I can carry with me.
1319073	1334218	I was literally today spending time at the enchantment table or whatever to give my armor some extra lifting abilities so I can just carry more crap with me as I'm going around.
1335239	1335339	Um...
1335979	1340202	I did one of the quests which was, I think it was called A Night to Remember or something like that.
1340842	1346226	And where you get drunk and somehow end up on the completely other side of the world.
1347026	1348307	And that's kind of what happened.
1348407	1351770	And so I've been journeying my way back.
1351850	1358154	But thankfully I could fast travel back to Whiterun to dump my crap into a cabinet.
1358234	1360896	Which this cabinet must have an infinite amount of space because I...
1361516	1362437	It's a big cabinet.
1362517	1367219	What you don't see in Skyrim is that at the other end of the cabinet is the door to Narnia.
1367800	1370761	So you just have all of Narnia to store your shit.
1370921	1372442	It pretty much is like that.
1375060	1378801	And it was... BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Loki was lollygagging.
1380861	1385443	And it's funny, though, because I had to dump off... I had 150 carats.
1387283	1388803	150 carats for no reason whatsoever.
1388823	1389784	You wascally wabbit.
1390144	1393965	So the first thing I started doing was like, I'm going to eat all these cures right now!
1394725	1398646	So I was hammering down A, but it just took forever to do that.
1399006	1401467	Your skill in vitamin A has increased to 22.
1402027	1402847	So I decided...
1403894	1405055	I'm gonna make it rain!
1405155	1409679	So I ran upstairs into this, like, uh, in this general goods store.
1409699	1415544	I ran upstairs to the balcony, and I was gonna throw the carrots off the balcony and want to see, like, a pile of carrots.
1415584	1416445	And you get a carrot!
1416665	1417606	And you get a carrot!
1417826	1418626	And you get a carrot!
1418867	1422089	But, no, unfortunately, it doesn't do it like that.
1422149	1429255	You would have to drop each one individually, um, because otherwise it drops them in piles of, like, 109 and stuff.
1429336	1431738	It was very unepic, so, um...
1433809	1438634	So yeah, I didn't do that, but I don't know, I've just been playing a lot.
1438834	1443879	I think I actually looked at my play time, I have like 36 hours in the game, and I've done like nothing.
1443899	1446121	And I'm probably further progressed in the story than you.
1446721	1448743	I've done like hardly anything in there.
1449104	1456150	I like to find the random dungeons, but then I'm like, oh, I don't want to explore this dungeon because somebody in the nearby town might have a quest.
1456451	1458813	So I need to go to the quest and talk to everybody until I find the...
1459213	1487247	and then I'm picking every single fucking flower on the way because I can't stop this game is horrible for people who have I go in with the JRPG mindset from Final Fantasy gotta find every treasure box, gotta open everything gotta get every item, I want my perfect run through, 999 everything you take that mindset to Skyrim you are fucked, you'll never get anything done and you will have 150 carats in your goddamn bag because you picked every single one that's
1488027	1492570	I go through all the towns searching the barrels and I know very well that there's not gold in those barrels.
1492730	1497833	It's gonna be carrots or apples or tomatoes or maybe cabbage that's worth nothing.
1497954	1499254	Carrots are literally worth nothing.
1499274	1501556	You cannot sell them for any money whatsoever.
1501576	1502176	But you can eat them.
1502817	1504978	You can eat them or drop them on the ground.
1505218	1507340	You know that if you eat too many carrots it will turn you orange?
1508640	1511502	I shit you not that happened to me when I was two and I had to go to the ER.
1512243	1517266	It's actually happened to several famous people like one of them was what was her name that played the older sister on the Partridge Family?
1517845	1518165	I don't know.
1519066	1520206	Susan Day, wasn't that her?
1520326	1520786	Okay, sure.
1521367	1526469	But she ate nothing but carrots and they had to tell her to stop eating carrots because she turned orange on screen.
1527769	1529590	Come on, get orange.
1530230	1530570	Trivia.
1531211	1534612	If I'm ever on Useless Crap Jeopardy, I'll remember that.
1535292	1539454	I'm trying to think if there's any other funny stuff that's happened glitch-wise.
1539474	1541015	Because I know there has been.
1544066	1545768	Yeah, like exploring random things.
1545808	1549651	I went into a cottage and there was this really powerful wizard in the cottage that wanted to kill me.
1549711	1552553	I was like, okay.
1553934	1562761	Or the... There's like some sort of... There's like so many bands of like... I've lost track of like all the different groups in the games.
1562821	1568946	Like, you know, they have the Imperials and the Stormcloaks and then they have the... What was it?
1568986	1569267	The...
1571619	1581003	Followers, and then some other weird band that's somewhere else that has these weird bone weapons.
1581423	1583844	They apparently suck, though, because I kicked the crap out of them.
1586365	1594010	Yeah, so basically I played lots of Skyrim, didn't really do much in the game other than, you know, go around.
1594350	1597932	I did happen, though, I was walking along and I saw these people wandering.
1598373	1606318	They're traders that were bringing gifts for a wedding that was the cousin of some head of the trade council or something like that.
1606938	1607839	And so they're like...
1609619	1635207	and they're basically like oh you know we really should get on our way and then one of the options was I'm gonna take those gifts from you so that's one of the options I did and then I murdered them and stole their gifts and I'm not I think that's part of a quest but I'm not really sure okay last Skyrim thing and then we've got to move on okay someone actually did have a question what in the chat yeah did you offer the wizard carrots Loki except I think it's a statement because he didn't use any punctuation
1637048	1637528	No, I did not.
1637748	1638649	All right, I got to play this.
1638709	1639490	Bobby sent this to me.
1639530	1642052	He said don't play the sound, so I guess there's talking or whatever over it.
1642113	1642873	It's music.
1642953	1643454	It's funny.
1643894	1644635	Oh, you've heard this?
1644935	1645176	Yes.
1645396	1649640	He says it's 2,500 cheese wheels rolling off a mountain.
1649660	1651462	Let's see here.
1651482	1652363	It's awesome.
1652403	1653584	It's done with console commands.
1654545	1655686	Oh, there they all go.
1659352	1662314	That is a mountain of cheese.
1664455	1667796	See, that's the kind of epicness that I wanted with the carrots.
1667936	1669317	What about this?
1669617	1675160	4,200 cabbages going downhill in the related video.
1675200	1675901	Oh, there they go.
1676041	1677541	All the cabbages going downhill.
1679722	1680763	That's not Skyrim music.
1680783	1681944	What the hell is that?
1682064	1682504	I don't know.
1682604	1684265	That's like techno porn music.
1684285	1685545	That's like porno music.
1686706	1688047	That's tech demo music, Rob.
1689258	1692801	If you like cabbages, if you like Skyrims, I got the video for you.
1715837	1717259	And then threw them off the mountain.
1728029	1728869	I can't fathom how that works.
1756792	1760816	Well, it's not like... It's pretty much what you think.
1761697	1764881	If you're playing an Xbox Live, there's single player and then there's Xbox Live.
1764961	1767163	So Xbox Live is the obvious mode, right?
1767544	1770907	You go in and it's just like the game.
1770987	1776033	And if you've never played the game before, you have green cards which have words like... They're like adjectives.
1776113	1776573	Like, you know...
1778075	1778876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1794145	1817063	and like for example one of the red cards is Helen Keller and that will always win every round and I'm proud to say Helen Keller is in the apples to apples 360 game it had to be there so um you know if somebody plays the green card sassy and I play Helen Keller then somebody might you know pick that as the winner and then the winner gets a point and then whoever gets you know five ten points whatever the game's rules are first wins the game whoo
1818044	1818725	X-Box Live
1839684	1840584	I thought it was funny.
1840604	1841345	I'm like, I get it.
1841565	1842126	It's a joke.
1842166	1844227	But somebody else is like, whatever.
1844367	1847230	And it started this whole political discussion.
1847270	1848210	I'm just like, come on.
1848250	1849772	It's apples to apples, people.
1850352	1851093	This isn't fun.
1851933	1853014	What about the single player?
1853334	1854315	How the hell does that work?
1854655	1856157	The single player is Boggle.
1856257	1857097	You ever play Boggle?
1858539	1861881	Where you find the words in the mixed grid of letters.
1862442	1867786	And so in the first few levels, you're just trying to figure out what red card would the computer pick?
1868599	1869900	and it's really obvious.
1870000	1871381	It's all these big stereotypes.
1873163	1882210	The apple might be dressed up like a princess and so the card might be something like pretty and the cards you get are like nuclear war.
1884352	1886053	Oatmeal, and Diamonds.
1886253	1888513	And so a princess, of course, is going to pick Diamonds.
1888873	1892335	So you have to find in the board D-I-A-O-M and you spell out Diamonds.
1892495	1893175	It's kind of dumb.
1893455	1896236	That sounds like racial profiling to me.
1897056	1897596	A little bit.
1897656	1898817	It's stereotyping a lot.
1899537	1902718	Especially when you start getting into the Cowboys and the Hippies and all that stuff.
1902758	1907839	But anyway, it gets impossibly hard though when words just disappear from the red cards.
1908340	1912701	And now it'll be like the red card will be Rock and
1913081	1930868	question, question, question, question and so you have to look on the board and be able to find roll and know that it goes with rock and not only that you have to figure out which one of the three cards it's as impossible to figure out how to play as it is to figure out how I'm explaining it to you to be honest so single player gets weird fast
1931928	1936973	I honestly think Apples to Apples is only going to be fun if you have people to play it with.
1937334	1938655	And how much was it again?
1938955	1938655	$10.
1939576	1943740	And honestly, for that price, you should go to Target and actually buy Apples to Apples.
1944320	1944841	I mean, really.
1945541	1948984	You'll have more fun with real people than you will, I think, online.
1949025	1949465	Sorry to say.
1950766	1977734	but you know for I guess a card game going to a flash game from a technical perspective would be it integrates with Facebook if you want to spam your achievements for everybody I don't see every Xbox game doing that so I guess some people are into that alright since you brought up games that are party games that have been translated to the Xbox here's a challenge for indie developers out there that I think this would be perfect for an indie game because they sure as hell aren't going to bring the Xbox Live Arcade
1978314	1979135	EAT POOP YOU CAN'T
1993328	1993708	Apples.
1993868	1998230	And then the next person draws a picture of the phrase.
1998731	2002993	And then the person after that, the first phrase is hidden.
2003033	2005914	So all they see is the picture and they have to come up with a new caption for it.
2006234	2010557	And it goes on from there until... Especially when you get people that can't draw at all like me.
2011057	2012237	Yeah, it goes on from there.
2012718	2013338	But I think...
2014744	2017886	That'd be hilarious to do a game like that.
2017906	2020767	Maybe have Xbox Live support or something like that.
2022188	2029592	AlphaKananagram in our chatroom is going so far as to correct me and even saying, but Sky, it's $20 at Target.
2029672	2030673	It's double.
2030953	2032454	Well, hold on, AlphaKananagram.
2032474	2038958	I'm going to one-up you because if you want to play with your friend on Xbox, you both have to buy the game, so that's $10 each.
2038978	2039078	Ha-ha!
2041894	2042775	Ha ha ha ha ha!
2043895	2044095	Ha.
2044776	2045996	And more if you have more friends.
2046056	2046257	Right.
2046777	2047397	So, anyhow.
2048858	2050979	I love that somebody actually went to look that up.
2051339	2055582	I'm going to hope he just bought that as a Christmas present for somebody recently or whatever it is he celebrates this time of year.
2056202	2056462	All right.
2057823	2059004	Anyhow, so there was that.
2059144	2060084	Other games I played this week.
2060144	2062146	Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS.
2063406	2066928	I'm going to say the exact same thing every other reviewer has said about Mario Kart 7.
2067269	2067609	You ready?
2068469	2069350	It's Mario Kart...
2071707	2073769	That's really an accurate description.
2073849	2075750	I mean, you know Mario Kart.
2075830	2078412	Anybody who's been playing games for a while knows Mario Kart.
2078452	2083976	It's the same game that was on the DS and it's on every Nintendo system and it's now on the 3DS.
2084156	2085717	The 3D is tasteful.
2085977	2086958	It's not over the top.
2088139	2088939	It's done fine.
2088999	2090400	It's fun to play with 3D.
2090681	2092342	The online works just like the Wii.
2092602	2097706	This almost essentially feels like a port of the Wii game to the 3DS but with some newer tracks.
2098326	2100987	I don't understand some of the online stuff they integrated.
2101047	2106669	Like my 3DS will randomly get these random ghosts, just seem to download from online.
2106689	2107509	Randomly random ghosts?
2107529	2108370	Yes, randomly random.
2108410	2109210	It's super random.
2111031	2112191	It's redundantly redundant?
2112351	2114352	And it'll be like, you just got a new ghost.
2114452	2121454	And I'll be like, oh, maybe I street passed with somebody or maybe somebody on my friends list just somehow sent me a ghost through the internet.
2121514	2121974	How cool.
2122295	2125696	And then I'll race against the ghost and it'll be like, you beat...
2126496	2128697	I'm gonna name my firstborn kanji text from Japan.
2128817	2129037	Shut up.
2129137	2130017	You can do community stuff.
2130077	2130877	So of course...
2144981	2150366	As we do for any new community thing that hits the internet, we have run and hurriedly set up the OL Army community.
2150446	2156090	I have no idea how community racing works, but from what I understand, there's like a top three for the month, and you can do all that.
2156130	2158172	So the friend code is posted on Twitter.
2158232	2159773	Twitter.com slash OL Army.
2159793	2161054	Sorry, community code.
2161115	2162015	It's different than a friend code.
2162275	2167660	The community code for the OL Army is posted on Twitter, and it's on our Facebooks as well.
2168741	2170943	And I'm sure somebody will post it and chat in a matter of minutes.
2171583	2175265	Add us, because live during the break tonight, I'm going to try and play it.
2175766	2182310	Now, I understand it might be an entire Grand Prix race, so I might have to drop, but I'll do at least a couple races with you guys during the midpoint break tonight.
2182330	2188433	I am planning on getting this game, and actually I'm also planning, not even planning, I am getting Super Mario 3D Land.
2188734	2190915	I will have it Friday.
2192468	2194369	TigerClaw in our chat says it's SpotPass.
2194629	2196849	Yeah, I know it's SpotPass, but it makes no sense.
2197370	2201131	Like, I get SpotPass in some of the other games I play, like Super Mario 3.
2201551	2202451	Ah, I know what it is.
2202491	2206212	It's all those Japanese developers that you StreetPassed with.
2207133	2209153	Didn't you, like, do some at E3?
2209213	2214515	Do you think because I've exchanged data with them before, like at E3, now I'm getting all their ghosts?
2214795	2215115	Really?
2215655	2215895	Yeah.
2216195	2219136	So I'm playing against Japanese developers and I'm kicking their ass?
2219256	2219737	Yeah!
2220277	2220797	Yeah, I think so.
2221417	2224598	I think if you cross-reference those ghosts with... Really?
2224739	2225039	Yeah.
2225439	2228720	Because that would be... That makes a lot of sense, actually.
2228760	2229621	That's kind of weird.
2230281	2230921	Interesting.
2231982	2235063	I know somebody who got Miyamoto's me at E3.
2235103	2235883	Wait, no, no, no.
2235903	2236184	Hold on.
2237384	2237864	I'm sorry.
2237984	2241586	It's just... The door is wide open for the jokes.
2243307	2246148	They might be easy to beat because they are of a certain nationality.
2247754	2252558	And they're not typically good drivers.
2256201	2257081	Racism fail.
2257221	2257542	Alright.
2259023	2260944	That's racism racing right there.
2264465	2264725	Stop.
2265085	2265345	All right.
2266586	2267406	But I will say this.
2267426	2273608	The other thing I got to say about Mario Kart 7 is that a lot of really good retro tracks came back, like Waluigi Pinball.
2273848	2274788	That track is so fun.
2274848	2276989	And some of the Wii tracks came back that are awesome, too.
2277249	2280830	Here's my gripe, and this has been since, like, I think even the NDS one.
2281030	2281271	All right.
2282927	2287913	What's up with them bringing back the most terrible tracks for Battle Mode?
2288613	2294940	Like, their decision, hey, from the 1064, let's bring back the big donut or something like that.
2295000	2296222	Like, one of the most...
2299596	2303440	They brought back Mario Circuit 2 from the original Super Nintendo game.
2303460	2309044	If I was going to bring back one of the courses from the Super Nintendo game, I would have brought back one of the Ghost Houses because those levels were epic.
2309265	2310866	I think they did that in the DS one, though.
2310886	2311446	Yeah, I know.
2311667	2315250	But it's like they picked these really random tracks that they bring back.
2315590	2320374	It's like, and you didn't want to bring back Blockfort or you didn't want to bring back, you know...
2321795	2323017	I don't remember the one that they had.
2323217	2323858	There was another one.
2323898	2328924	It was like a four-tiered one or a three-tiered one on the Nintendo 64 version.
2328944	2329766	That was pretty awesome.
2330587	2332589	But, oh, those are terrible.
2332649	2338257	We'll just bring back the donut or all the weird ones that they had on the Wii that just made no sense.
2340086	2342467	Alright, so that's Mario Kart 7.
2343087	2349308	It's Mario Kart, but it's... Look, if you have a 3DS already, you probably have already bought Mario Kart 7.
2349608	2350749	I don't know what else I can tell you.
2351289	2358550	If you've never played a Mario Kart game before, then go to a friend's house who has it and use Download Play, because you can do Download Play with one kart.
2358590	2359111	And there you go.
2359351	2359911	Instant demo.
2360971	2361871	Alright, one more.
2361891	2362691	You should have brought your system.
2362711	2362951	Alright.
2363492	2364072	One more game.
2364172	2365632	I Street Pass with people at Umlaut too.
2365672	2368513	I got like all these new houses in Mario 3D Land.
2368733	2369833	Toad houses and stuff.
2369853	2371633	So anyway.
2372613	2374054	One more game to talk about this week.
2374354	2374694	One more.
2374814	2375194	Unamas.
2375354	2379035	And it's a game that Loki loaned to me two weeks ago that I finally got around to playing this week.
2379095	2381455	Yes, I jumped in and I played Saints Row the Third.
2382015	2385936	Which is totally not the type of game I would ever imagine myself playing.
2385956	2389237	Because like, I get why people like Grand Theft Auto, but I'm always like...
2391480	2393363	I'd rather play a role playing game or something.
2393423	2396628	But I decided to approach Saints Row 3 with an open mind.
2396929	2398712	Or Saints Row the 3rd, excuse me, with an open mind.
2398752	2399453	And I gotta tell you,
2400103	2401804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2422859	2423720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2443498	2454046	And I gotta say, I'm actually really impressed at how well they integrate the whole create your own character and get it into the experience.
2454126	2458149	Because towards the beginning of the game, you're allowed to create whatever kind of character you want.
2458569	2465454	You can create boy, girl, big boobies, little boobies, fat, skinny...
2465794	2466435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2483502	2490585	and no matter what it is you pick, you're like fully integrated into the game as the leader of this gang.
2491005	2504590	So I decided to make my character, I made kind of like Pam Grier from a Blaxploitation film in the 70s if she had, well she did have gigantic titties, but like unrealistically big titties.
2505491	2510693	Because I took the tit meter as high as it would go and she's large and in charge.
2510973	2538946	and at first I was going to make her a grandma but I decided no I'm going to scale back the age a little bit so she's kind of like a husky kind of Pam Greer and it's like what I love about it is that it flows so well with the woman voice and everything like the way I know what you guys are thinking like what you're saying a woman can't be in charge or whatever but no what I'm saying is that it's almost like they've recorded everything seven or eight times or however many characters there are
2539486	2567790	To get the script to work And that's damn impressive That attention to detail On something so stupid But it pays off tremendously That attention to detail Pays off tremendously I was laughing so fucking hard I was crying during that airplane sequence Where my character gets sucked out the door So her fat ass is rolling down The little chute And then there's skydiving or whatever And there's this whole skydiving sequence And you're literally freaking
2567810	2569810	You gotta remember, to put this in perspective
2595848	2608879	Last week, or the week before, I was talking about White Knight Chronicles 2 on the PlayStation 3, where you also create a character, but your character never talks, your character is a bystander, your character isn't integrated into the story at all.
2609159	2617006	I'm not saying this makes White Knight Chronicles a bad game, but when you put that side by side with the lengths that they've gone to integrate whatever it is you want...
2617426	2618047	Thanks for watching!
2636303	2640204	You're listening to the radio and Sublime's What I Got comes on the radio.
2640704	2645066	And you and your gang member that you're driving with start singing along to the song.
2645126	2647467	Like, Loving is what I got.
2647727	2651728	And they're singing it the way people in that role would really sing it.
2651768	2656289	You know, like there's a line in the song that goes like, But I can still get high.
2656429	2658310	And like my character shouts like, You know it!
2660011	2660351	Like it's...
2661611	2685651	it's little things like that that just put this game in a caliber where it's like you really like I think you have to experience it like I Loki you're right it's games hilarious and it's fun to play okay I'm gonna have to play it it only gets better it's just you think that the whole airplane thing was ridiculous let me put this way have you seen the new the new 18 movie
2687272	2688594	No, I haven't seen the new A-Team movie, sorry.
2688614	2691657	Okay, well, there's... Let me put it this way.
2691677	2697843	The first skydive sequence reminded me a lot of Shoot Em Up, the Clive Owen movie.
2698303	2707052	Spoiler, there is a second skydive sequence at one point that reminds me a lot of the A-Team, where they try to fly a tank.
2707652	2707772	Just...
2708993	2713878	I can't stress, and no, somebody in the chat room asked, Ranma asked if I gave my character an afro.
2713998	2719343	No, I did, I gave her the long flowing hot black hair to go, she's got the volume.
2719363	2720023	You gave her the Beyonce hair.
2720043	2720584	Voluminous.
2720784	2721965	No, she has voluminous hair.
2722406	2725288	Kind of a modern, modern day Jackie Brown, Pam Greer looking thing.
2725809	2726770	But just...
2727350	2731836	My character is so sassy and that's what I wanted her to be and it's great.
2733458	2736061	I did play some more Saints Row the Third this week.
2736121	2736602	I forgot.
2737203	2740527	We've been playing Horde mode during our lunch breaks.
2740967	2743150	Horde mode is pretty fun on its own actually.
2743851	2746014	It's just really ridiculous some of the stuff that they have.
2746434	2746834	DarkSakura
2766431	2769454	So you really think we should do that?
2769834	2770855	I don't want to play a zombie.
2771836	2775679	If I play it, I want to make my type of character.
2775760	2778562	And the zombie will sing what I got as well.
2780163	2782606	Travis Donovan over at Understation Live made me.
2782906	2784467	He's been playing through the game as me.
2784768	2786109	And apparently I like to run around.
2786209	2789592	Apparently I do this in real life with hot pink bunny slippers and a Hello Kitty backpack.
2789892	2791894	Because that's what the me character in the game has.
2792515	2792715	But...
2793335	2802238	I imagine the game is hilarious still because you're playing this guy and, you know, probably still really funny with all the outfits.
2802258	2808720	So just don't expect – like you got to put a game like Saints Row the Third side by side with Skyrim.
2810520	2812821	And they couldn't – they're so different.
2812841	2815942	But they're both like open world games and so forth.
2815982	2818143	And I think it's just one of those things where it's like –
2819045	2829539	Like, Skyrim is the Oscar-nominated picture you see at the arthouse movie, which is a great experience, and you'll just, you'll be, you know, happy to have witnessed it.
2829639	2835727	Okay, it's basically, it's Lord of the Rings and fucking Transformers, I mean, that's...
2836808	2838469	Except Transformers wasn't actually good.
2838649	2846456	Saints Row the Third is like getting high and going to see Pink Floyd's The Wall set to the lasers.
2846977	2850100	Would it be the difference between watching Lord of the Rings and Friday?
2850908	2851248	Yes!
2852189	2853331	That's a great analogy.
2853691	2856614	Friday is also an amazing movie, right?
2856714	2858817	It's hilarious, but not for the same reasons.
2859117	2861179	Friday's just fucking funny, right?
2861680	2862721	That's a great analogy.
2862781	2865544	I would compare it to, like, Lord of the Rings and the movie Shoot Em Up.
2865564	2866525	Shoot Em Up is seriously...
2868006	2869987	This game follows that movie.
2871128	2873389	There's a lot of stuff that they took straight out of it.
2873409	2875571	Just ridiculous action sequences.
2876791	2881514	The whole intro is seriously ripped off of that movie, but I don't care because it's awesome.
2882102	2885063	Alright, let's go to one question from the chatroom and then we gotta get to gaming news.
2885423	2887623	It's been like an hour and we're still talking about our gaming weeks.
2887843	2892524	TigerClaw says, makes you wonder, if they were ever to make a Saints Row movie, would it be an action comedy?
2892864	2896805	Okay, look, whoever does the Saints Row movie, which I am all for at this point.
2897025	2899905	I absolutely think they should make a Saints Row movie.
2900305	2903506	And I think it should be over the top stupid funny.
2903586	2905606	Like, it needs to be like Airplane, okay?
2905986	2908607	So I think the Zucker Brothers should do the Saints Row movie.
2908627	2908867	Okay.
2909648	2911810	They need to just incorporate Leslie Nielsen in there somewhere.
2912010	2912290	He's dead.
2912310	2913091	Even though he's dead.
2913451	2914892	I know, but I mean, it doesn't matter.
2914913	2916034	He could be the zombie boss.
2916114	2916654	It doesn't matter.
2916714	2918676	They could, you know, work him in.
2918776	2919937	It's true.
2920298	2921639	Through technology these days.
2922179	2922640	Exactly.
2923240	2930147	Well, if they could do, you know, what was that last Bruce Lee movie where he's dead halfway through filming it?
2932962	2937590	Zether in our chatroom says, I thought you guys were talking about the song Friday.
2939172	2940815	Still an accurate comparison.
2943218	2944040	Lord of the Rings.
2944761	2948242	Rebecca Black's Friday with 17 gazillion YouTube views.
2948422	2948862	Alright, look.
2949162	2949983	So that was my gaming week.
2950023	2950823	Saints Row the Third.
2951503	2952804	Hilariously stupid.
2953364	2953924	Hilarious.
2954584	2960146	Alright, and I will play more of it because I just, I laugh consistently when I'm playing that game and I think that's so important.
2960866	2961847	So, alright.
2963147	2965929	Sometimes you want Final Fantasy, sometimes you want dick and fart jokes.
2968050	2968911	Housekeeping.

2974774	2975434	We are on Facebook.
2975895	2977135	Upcoming show schedule.
2977476	2979377	We will be here next week on the 18th.
2979717	2986621	We will not be here on the 25th, although some alternative thing might go on on the 25th, like online or something.
2986661	2986981	I don't know.
2988822	2989823	I got a milkshake!
2990163	2990804	Where's mine?
2991124	2992125	Alright, just kidding.
2992945	2995467	Anyway, I had Starbucks on the way here, if you can't tell.
2995507	2996548	I'm wired on coffee today.
2997268	2999510	On the 1st, we should have a show.
2999950	3002132	As of right now, it looks like we will have a show on the 1st.
3002172	3005574	I don't know of anybody who doesn't, can't, or whatever, be here on the 1st.
3006174	3007495	So I think we're doing a show then.
3008316	3011078	Which is the exact opposite of Bobby, who comes on before us.
3011118	3012379	Bobby's going to do a show Christmas night.
3013059	3016902	So spend your Christmas with Bobby here on All Games Radio, and then spend your New Year's with us.
3017776	3018496	We'll ring in 2012.
3019937	3023379	Okay, let's get into the gaming news.
3023439	3030063	Surprisingly enough, for this time of year, when everybody's getting ready to go on holiday breaks and everything, there's a lot of damn gaming news going on, right?
3030103	3030864	Loki, start us off.
3031124	3035487	Yeah, well, this week they had the VGAs, the Spike Video Game Awards show.
3036088	3040151	And, of course, with the VGAs, there's a lot of... Do you watch the VGAs?
3040691	3040831	Nope.
3041251	3041712	No, me neither.
3042112	3043673	I don't even have to ask Jamie.
3043993	3045515	I'll just watch the trailers afterwards.
3045675	3046335	Why am I going to waste time?
3046375	3046976	Thank you, TigerClaw.
3046996	3047736	It was game of death.
3049077	3054821	Everything I've heard about the VGAs online was that people felt their IQs dropping rapidly as they were watching it.
3054901	3056102	As if anybody should be surprised.
3056923	3058364	It's Spike, no offense, but...
3058717	3065361	I mean, they have GameTrailersTV, and GameTrailers did a lot of the trailer stuff.
3065541	3067062	They have it hosted on their site.
3068422	3073785	It's just like watching GTTV, because it's really late, and obviously I don't watch it then.
3073846	3076647	But I'll just catch it when the trailers come online the next day.
3076987	3079369	And that's kind of what happened, for the most part.
3080329	3108850	um so one of they of course announced they tease and they announce a lot of games um during the show so one of the games of course that's been you know talked about for a while Metal Gear Solid Rising well now apparently Metal Gear Solid Rising is now Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance which almost sounds like a made up word but I'm it's vengeance subtitles are cool it's vengeance but revengeance hey it's called a portmanteau
3110821	3111342	Kunju Tite.
3112662	3114523	It's a combination of two words, duh.
3115164	3121928	Really, I think the reason they have to add the subtitle in the first place is because it's going to be a series, would be my guess.
3122829	3127311	But yeah, it's now actually being worked on by Platinum Games.
3127351	3135696	Of course, the company responsible for such wonderful things like Bayonetta or Mad World or...
3138149	3138790	Oh, what was the other one?
3138810	3150198	Which, funny enough, coming off the Saints Row third discussion is kind of in that same bucket where Bayonetta, again, sometimes you just want a big stupid action movie and don't get me wrong, Bayonetta is great.
3150439	3153701	Bayonetta would make an awesome movie and they have to.
3154782	3161627	If a Bayonetta movie ever happens, Joe Pesci better fucking be in that movie because if there's no Joe Pesci... He's almost too old.
3161947	3162388	They gotta hurry.
3162428	3163649	No, no, no, he can do it.
3164029	3164930	No, they need Mark Shepard.
3166331	3166511	Who?
3166811	3167332	Mark Shepard.
3167392	3167672	Who's he?
3169113	3169934	You don't want Supernatural.
3170334	3171215	Of course I don't.
3171436	3172497	He plays Crowley.
3172597	3173678	I'm a 30-year-old male.
3173738	3175480	There's nothing in Supernatural for me.
3178463	3180325	He would be perfect for that role.
3180605	3181006	Fair enough.
3181747	3184109	Except Joe Pesci is that role.
3185130	3186512	When I played the game, I thought Joe Pesci too.
3186532	3189335	But if Joe Pesci was too old, then I guess whoever DarkSakura is talking about.
3190329	3217241	so but that'd be that'd be awesome but anyways yeah it's not a lot of details are you know released about this yet other than the fact that you know new studios working on it now and also it's supposed to take place now in the time period after Metal Gear Solid 4 and I guess you're gonna be doing like mercenary work for different people and stuff I heard um it's getting a lot of flack from the Metal Gear community because it's not a true quote-unquote Metal Gear game
3218622	3223304	But I'm kind of like, well, I mean, they've done a lot of spin-off Metal Gear games.
3223905	3228707	And in my opinion, you know, I was kind of like, oh, okay, whatever about this game.
3228727	3231848	But now that I hear that the Bayonetta folks are involved, I've perked up a little bit.
3231868	3235610	And I'm like, oh, they're serious about making an action Metal Gear game at this point.
3235630	3238011	Because, you know, Bayonetta was a heck of a game.
3238091	3243434	So I'm kind of interested in this, like, way more than I was before, which was only a little bit.
3243954	3244134	So...
3244974	3245975	These things are going to happen.
3246155	3249537	Are you going to be completely denied a Metal Gear Solid 5 because of this game?
3249617	3250257	I don't think so.
3250797	3255460	It'll happen eventually.
3255660	3261523	Kojima's even said that they're going to be doing a 5.
3262364	3263324	He knows that people want a 5.
3264185	3266186	Actdeft in our chatroom says simply, I kind of agree.
3270024	3272728	If the fans of Metal Gear or whatever don't want it, then don't buy it.
3273088	3273549	More for me.
3274850	3284043	Alright, well, we were talking about the new Xbox Live dashboard that rolled out this week and you might have not noticed this, but thankfully the internet was there to help you out.
3285184	3295011	The terms of service for Xbox have recently updated where now you will not be able to essentially sue Microsoft as part of a class action agreement anymore.
3295412	3300556	You might remember this conversation from a few months ago when Sony did the same thing in their terms of service.
3301016	3311462	Except there's kind of a difference and that is that, you know, Sony had that whole hack thing that went on a while ago and like actually had a reason that people might want to file a class action lawsuit.
3311482	3314344	But Microsoft, to our knowledge, hasn't had anything happen.
3315124	3317645	But then there's that part of me that goes, well...
3319006	3319927	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3341549	3342231	I don't know, it's interesting.
3342251	3347084	Would you really go to a court and actually start a lawsuit against them?
3350154	3355258	I think if you're going to start a lawsuit against Microsoft, just do it on your own.
3355298	3364324	I understand class action lawsuits are just so... I think a lot of the class action lawsuits are started by these lawyers that just want to make some money.
3365025	3369808	And they just send out a blanket notice to everybody and they're like, hey, money's coming your way.
3369848	3370429	And you're like, woohoo!
3370889	3374011	I don't have to do shit, you know, and I get free money.
3374491	3376752	I mean, I think that's what happened with like Grand Theft Auto.
3376772	3379534	I don't even know if I ever got a check for Grand Theft Auto.
3380154	3388939	I don't really care because I still had Grand Theft Auto and I wasn't going to, you know, San Andreas, the first issue with the hot coffee stuff in there.
3389099	3390060	Yeah, it's a collector's item now.
3390860	3393221	I mean, I don't know.
3393461	3394282	It's just kind of...
3395799	3396419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3414449	3417912	If you really feel like you've been wronged, you should have the right to take them to a legal court.
3417992	3419574	Isn't that granted in the Constitution?
3419614	3425660	If you have a settlement that's more than $20 in value, you have a right to a trial by jury?
3425740	3427601	Well, I think that they're actually...
3429583	3440987	They're going to be doing some sort of... I want to say there's been some court cases or places in the United States that have found that those arbitration things can't be upheld in court or something.
3441688	3442908	It's kind of like on both sides.
3442968	3450251	I think there's been some cases that have gone in the favor of the whole arbitration clauses and some against it.
3450511	3452672	It's just which one has precedence or not.
3453772	3457655	All right, anyhow, I do want to point out, this is important, you can't opt out of this, by the way.
3457675	3460417	If you want to keep using Xbox Live, you cannot opt out of this.
3460457	3472546	There was some rumor going around at first that it kind of had the postcard thing going on, but actually what's going on is that you can reject future changes to the arbitration agreement, but you cannot decline this one.
3472606	3475168	So if you don't like it, you've got to stop using Xbox Live.
3475549	3476650	And I've got to get this out here.
3476830	3479572	This is the one other big thing I do not like about this.
3480012	3481072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3501188	3511875	And I'm sure that they've got it in the small text or whatever before when you're paying for your life that we can change this at any time, you know, and without notice and blah, blah, blah.
3511995	3514417	They have their lawyers covering their asses for this shit.
3514837	3517199	Some states are taking action against these things, too.
3517379	3520601	So, you know, maybe a matter of time before these types of agreements are illegal anyway.
3521101	3522042	But, I mean, look at it this way.
3522082	3523663	I mean, honestly, I mean, look at...
3525254	3530382	Are any of you really going to just go after Microsoft and actually file a lawsuit?
3530602	3532284	I think not, for the most case.
3532805	3538333	If they do something to you that really pisses you off, here's how you take care of it later on.
3538393	3539735	You don't buy their next console.
3540036	3540636	You just say...
3541878	3566789	whatever if you smear them on the internet like everyone else does or yes smear them on the internet well i'm just like seriously if it's if it's so bad that you actually have to go and file a lawsuit against you know whatever company maybe microsoft sony nintendo whoever um if it's they're pissing you off that much that you just like i gotta go file a lawsuit against them then just don't buy their product that's true kick them where it counts in the wallet
3567609	3580235	I mean, because a lot of people may go that route if there's something like, you know, if it comes out 45 days later, they're like, oh, you had to sign this arbitration clause and there's been this massive leak that you've been, you know, covering up.
3580355	3581676	Trust me, they'll get it in the end.
3581976	3585158	You know, someone will investigate and say, hey, what the fuck?
3585218	3588099	You know, why are you having these people sign this?
3588460	3590581	Oh, because you knew that you were going to get sued.
3590681	3592241	So, I mean...
3593642	3599149	I mean, just like, you know, people were worried about buying the 360 back when the whole Red Ring, you know, was going around.
3599369	3605316	By the way, I was at a Target the other day with a new Xbox, one of the newer ones, Red Ringed E68.
3605416	3609581	Not Red Dot, excuse me, the Red Dot of Death with an E68 error.
3610242	3610763	Hilarious.
3611624	3612585	Problem's still not gone.
3613185	3613546	Just saying.
3615137	3615297	Yeah.
3616118	3618741	Alright, anyhow, so there you have it.
3619322	3620904	Take it or leave it.
3621745	3624889	Get off Xbox Live, I guess, if you don't like it at this point, but I don't know.
3624949	3626591	At the end of the day, if I get pissed off enough...
3627830	3655796	that agreement ain't gonna stop me and I don't think it can I think that's only about class that's a class action waiver if me as an individual wants to sue Microsoft I believe I can still do that I don't think anybody can take that right away no it would be highly illegal but they're just gonna make it very fucking difficult to do that yeah of course they just keep up in the it's just another case of the big guys big companies trying to you know but Rob corporations are people anyway alright let's move on
3656283	3657724	Well, um, Epic.
3658244	3659064	We know Epic, don't we?
3660245	3662226	Well, um, they've announced a game for the Vita.
3662906	3664327	The PS Vita, sorry.
3665307	3668389	Um, and it is a zombie game called Fortnite.
3668929	3670110	F-O-R-T-N-I-T-E.
3671030	3681896	And, um, there wasn't actually any gameplay shown in the trailer, but it said that it showed all the characters picking up trash and scrap metal and bringing it back, and then the zombies show up.
3682996	3690580	So basically, from what I understand is that it's preparing for a zombie assault and then the zombies come and you survive the assault.
3690961	3695303	That would be awesome if it was like Junkyard Wars meets a zombie apocalypse.
3695854	3696595	More info in a fortnight.
3696715	3696795	Ugh.
3719341	3720322	Thanks for watching!
3737543	3740085	by Bioware, Command & Conquer Generals 2.
3740606	3743568	I almost forgot that there was a Command & Conquer Generals game.
3744069	3749053	But it's set to come out 2013 on PC exclusively.
3749493	3757320	It's going to be using the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which you may remember from Battlefield 3, which looked pretty awesome.
3758000	3758320	So...
3760399	3761800	Very cool to check it out.
3762220	3785994	I did not play the first Generals game, but I know it was a little bit different than the regular Command & Conquer game because I believe it was one where you're actually... If I remember correctly, you're actually playing as one of the troops kind of on the ground, and you can still kind of control different things as well, but it's not just like an RTS game like before, if I remember correctly.
3786154	3786855	I could be wrong, though.
3786895	3787135	There might...
3787555	3790236	Maybe another Command & Conquer game that was also along the lines of that.
3791177	3799581	It's very interesting to me that they are going PC only with this, especially with some developers saying we'll never make PC games again.
3799962	3803844	I think it's just mainly because Command & Conquer is not very popular on consoles, actually.
3804424	3806945	It's just really more of a PC game.
3807065	3810567	It just hasn't done well when they've brought the last few to consoles.
3810607	3811548	Makes sense.
3812768	3815190	It's like Civilization, maybe, that it doesn't...
3816030	3823013	I was going to say it doesn't translate well to consoles, but I actually think that Civilization Revolution game was pretty good for a console game.
3823033	3827956	But it was a scaled-back experience, so it wasn't the same Civilization you really get on PC.
3828016	3836880	It would be a good game, I think, RTS-wise, it would be a good game for the Wii U. I think RTS games translate well for the Wii U with...
3837560	3840723	You know, touch screen and you can move stuff around that way.
3840763	3841523	That'd be kind of cool.
3841784	3844306	Because it'd be like playing, what was it?
3844946	3851232	There was a Tom Clancy's... The Tom Clancy game, not End War, but it was...
3854199	3861061	and Ruse where they had that actually playable on Microsoft Surface systems and you could you know mess around with that.
3861341	3867743	It'd be kind of similar to playing it on like a Surface or something but you'd be playing it with the tablet if you will.
3867803	3879946	So I could see RTS is coming over there but yeah it's just going to be right now PC only and you know if it does well on PC they may decide to try it again on consoles but as of right now it's just PC and 2013 is when you can expect that.
3881701	3884103	As a Command & Conquer fan, are you going to pick this up?
3884303	3886164	No, I haven't played Command & Conquer.
3886184	3888665	It's the series' first Red Alert game.
3888765	3891087	I mean, that's how long ago it's been.
3891287	3892207	That is a long time ago.
3893868	3894209	All right.
3894689	3897110	Well, I'm going to one more game that was announced at the...
3898291	3899132	The Last of Us The Last of Us
3920785	3922987	I don't know what kind of game they're going for.
3923007	3927089	If it's survivable horror or action, I think it's supposed to be a hybrid of the two.
3927509	3931411	To me, the trailer, and I'm going to play a little bit of the trailer here so at least you get some of the audio.
3931772	3939576	The trailer to me looked a little bit like a mixture between, what's that Will Smith movie where he's alone in the world after the outbreak?
3940497	3941117	I Am Legend.
3941157	3941517	Thank you.
3941597	3946120	It looks like I Am Legend mixed with a father-daughter bonding thing going on here.
3947322	3949144	Oh, Daddy, you killed him just fine.
3949344	3951546	Well, she kills one here later on in the trailer.
3952247	3954369	There's kind of one coming up here.
3954389	3955670	I'm proud of you, baby.
3956731	3958833	And she looks like the girl from Juno, which is a little weird to me.
3960254	3960734	Is it just me?
3961955	3963317	But you know the premise of this, right?
3964117	3970063	It's that bacteria, fungus, or whatever that they have in the rainforest that takes over actual...
3972885	3979070	and insects or whatever and infects their brain and then they eventually, I think, die.
3979510	3981372	It controls their body almost.
3981412	3982713	Wasn't that the plot to I Am Legend?
3983534	3985075	No, I Am Legend was vampires.
3985155	3986756	Or was that 28 Days Later?
3986776	3988257	28 Days Later was zombies.
3988297	3990819	I'm sorry, it was a disease, but it's zombies.
3990899	3993942	Okay, so it's 28 Days Later mixed with I Am Legend mixed with Juno.
3994162	3994342	Okay.
3998826	4001188	I guess the graphics look good.
4001568	4006752	If that really is real-time rendering or whatever, then it looks really good.
4006792	4010676	Now, just because it's coming from a PlayStation 3 system, I kind of go, well, it could be just a Blu-ray movie.
4010956	4015580	But if that is really in real-time being developed by the engine, that's, I gotta say, a good-looking game.
4015780	4019622	Uncharted 3 is a pretty sexy looking game, so I can believe that that's real time.
4019662	4020383	Okay, point taken.
4020943	4025406	And this is, by the way, just referencing Bobby's show earlier this evening, this is why he calls the game The Last of Us.
4026086	4028928	Because Office is all one word looking there.
4029268	4030889	No, it's not.
4031970	4036152	Yes, I can see that the kerning between the F and the U... Hey, you used the right term!
4036192	4036993	Speaking of FU...
4039114	4039515	You know what?
4040276	4041958	But you did use the right term.
4043720	4047505	Once in a while, DarkSakura, this might shock you, once in a while, I have a smart moment.
4048188	4049288	You know what I would have done though?
4049388	4049588	What?
4050048	4055749	I would have moved the S, actually I would have kerned it a little bit differently so that the space where the T and the S would have been exactly the same.
4056209	4057410	And that would have looked really hot.
4057590	4058270	Hey, guess what?
4059410	4060350	Hire me, people!
4060470	4061630	I'm a good designer, really.
4061930	4062431	Hey, guess what?
4062891	4063071	What?
4063251	4063771	No one ker.
4063971	4064191	Alright.
4064231	4066271	You know what I would have done differently?
4066391	4069752	I would have called it The Happening 2 because that's really kind of what it is.
4070372	4073112	It's plants taking over people.
4073132	4074353	Plants versus zombies!
4074453	4075273	Actually, you know what?
4075293	4075933	The Happening...
4077130	4077871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4096023	4097425	Wait, I just said more realistic?
4097445	4099107	I'm sorry, it's an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
4099207	4100489	It's not realistic at all.
4100989	4106516	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com says, Every game could be better with Tim Curry in it.
4107337	4109439	I don't know where that comes from, but yes, that would be absolutely true.
4109499	4114806	In fact, if Pennywise the Clown was in this game, it would be the scariest video game of all time, quite possibly.
4115322	4115782	You know what?
4134467	4135608	That just means he's a good actor.
4136009	4137590	No, no, no, no, no.
4137610	4139772	Tim Curry, I'm fine with.
4140313	4142835	Some of the scariest characters from your childhood were Tim Curry.
4142855	4143195	Think about it.
4143235	4150942	Pennywise the Clown, Darkness from Legend, Dr. Frankenfurter, Rooster from Annie.
4151503	4151763	I mean...
4153732	4154152	Thanks for watching!
4172583	4173264	That would be awesome.
4173344	4173904	That's right.
4174865	4175905	It would be so random.
4177226	4181589	As part of the marketing plan, they should never show who the leader of the gang is in any of the trailers.
4182009	4184431	Just leave it up to the movie and people find out it's Tim Curry.
4184611	4184891	You know what?
4185031	4187553	He should be in the snazziest suit and everything.
4188053	4190335	Except they finally show his feet and it's nine inch heels.
4191275	4192376	All right, look, moving on.
4193057	4193638	We got another story.
4193858	4196921	I do want to tease this, though, because we're getting towards the end of part eight, and this is important.
4197401	4206811	If you have Mario Kart 7, get your 3DS out, go to twitter.com slash OLR, or maybe somebody in chat will yell it out again, add us to your community list.
4207251	4207572	DarkSakura.com
4228459	4229099	Dr. Who, The Eternity Clock
4251604	4261590	and hopefully there are some Cybermen and Daleks in it because it's not a Doctor Who thing without Cybermen and Daleks eventually showing up in some form or another.
4261670	4266813	Actually, I bet it's going to have the silence in it even though the silence did get totally... Oh, no, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
4269014	4271616	But it's being built by Supermassive Games.
4271656	4275178	They're the ones who did Sackboy's prehistoric moves for LittleBigPlanet 2.
4276558	4280761	And if there's a PC version, I really hope they do it for Steam.
4281041	4286664	Now wouldn't that be awesome if they had like a little big planet to download content pack that was the doctor?
4287144	4287985	That would be awesome.
4288605	4293267	But then he'd just walk around sonic screwdrivering everything and doing his timey-wimey stuff.
4294948	4295608	I want a TARDIS.
4296009	4296549	I have a TARDIS.
4298027	4299068	I totally want this game.
4299428	4303271	You know, one of our listeners in the UK sent me a Doctor Who game a while back.
4303591	4304151	Yeah, I remember that.
4304611	4306253	And it wasn't very good from what I remember.
4306853	4310976	It was Top Trumps or whatever the card game is.
4311356	4312116	It was pretty fun.
4312156	4313157	It actually was really fun.
4313237	4315539	It's just I had no idea how to play when I first played it.
4316179	4317120	It was so foreign.
4318559	4323221	It was so, so un-American.
4323781	4324262	No, I'm kidding.
4324742	4328884	No, it was actually pretty fun, but it had Martha in it, so I had to gag a little bit.
4329793	4336795	All right, we're going to travel around the world and check out release dates, although we're getting to that time of year where if it was going to come out, it's out.
4336855	4340835	But there's some coal at the bottom of the stocking if you dig enough.
4340875	4341316	Right, Loki?
4342256	4347157	Yeah, let me see if I can do this all in one breath because it's very, very small.
4347297	4347817	All right, here we go.
4347937	4348117	U.S.
4348157	4348397	states.
4348437	4348757	Here we go.
4349157	4356799	All right, we have Outdoor Unleashed, Alaska and Africa on the 3DS, Dr. Lork and the Forgotten Knights on the 3DS, and I Heart Geeks on the Nintendo DS.
4358180	4359881	Well, this is a big week for DS people.
4361121	4362142	That was it.
4362382	4363303	What's iHeartGeeks?
4363803	4369286	iHeartGeeks is something that's from... Remember Mark Echo and the crappy Getting Up game?
4369466	4372548	Well, Mark Echo is now providing some stuff for this iHeartGeeks.
4372588	4374510	It's like, I think, The Incredible Machine or something.
4375870	4377952	That was an epic game on the PC.
4378012	4379412	Yeah, it was an epic game.
4379873	4381174	They kind of beat it into the ground.
4381734	4383595	It's just not quite as cool anymore.
4383615	4384656	I like the box art.
4384696	4385136	It's cute.
4386691	4388352	I don't even think they even have a trailer for it.
4388412	4393254	But yeah, it's got some artwork by Mark Echo, and that's about it.
4394474	4397195	All right, well, let's go over to Japan and check out some release dates in Japan.
4397215	4400537	I got to say it's... Oh, and I'm sorry, the Oregon Trail 3DS, because I got delayed a week.
4401277	4401917	Ah, you screwed up.
4401957	4402637	That wasn't one breath.
4402737	4402978	All right.
4403818	4404998	Well, I said it last week, so that's all right.
4405158	4411341	I got to say, for those of you that like to import your games, especially we'll get to PlayStation 3 in a minute here, because PS3 is a region free and all.
4411801	4412821	Thanks for watching!
4434850	4450181	Final Fantasy XIII-2 here in the States will be coming out on the 31st of January Not a bad delay all things considered And BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend would be on the 22nd I believe of February
4450859	4454122	Now, PlayStation 3 in Japan has some of the similar stuff.
4454142	4470254	They also have Final Fantasy XIII too, but they're also getting a whole darn console in the Final Fantasy XIII too style, which is weird to me, because they did one for the Final Fantasy XIII, and I would think any Final Fantasy person probably already bought it back then, but maybe, I don't know, I guess this one's a slim, so maybe...
4470754	4472335	Umeneko no Naku Koro Nisan Shinzutsu to Gensu no Yasuyoku
4502015	4503176	I'm reading the description here.
4503296	4505058	Take another step closer to the truth.
4505498	4512124	The game Battler plays with Beatrice is coming to an end in Shinsutsu to Gensou no Yasukyo.
4512144	4516307	I'm trying to think if this is something that... I'm trying to think if this is something that exists here.
4516407	4518209	Oh, it's another raising game.
4518329	4519149	Another sim.
4520731	4522112	That may very well be...
4524455	4525035	Oh, what the hell?
4525075	4526576	They just announced a sequel to it too.
4526716	4528117	It was a PlayStation 3 only game.
4529318	4531979	There's chocolate cake involved, I can see from one of the screenshots here.
4532179	4532980	Chocolate cake.
4533080	4536021	This game actually has cake, unlike Portal.
4537222	4541184	Well, it's described as having vivid character illustrations and atmospheric music.
4541404	4544206	Soundtrack with 80 pieces of music in the game.
4545583	4546084	So there you go.
4546564	4549067	That is coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4549127	4551129	So a more exciting week over Japan.
4551149	4552971	I thought it was the game with the Soul Breed system.
4553031	4554413	I can't remember what the hell it was called.
4554813	4558057	I just set the item too this week, but yeah, that really stuck in my mind.
4558117	4558998	Can I get this out though?
4559038	4561020	Do you know what else makes this week exciting in Japan?
4561080	4562101	Way more exciting than here?
4563002	4585466	The PlayStation Vita is unleashed on December 17th So before we have our next show, the Vita will be out somewhere in the world And of course, lots and lots and lots of launch games I don't really have time to read through them all But the Vita and all its games are out this week Record of the Agorist War But I don't think that I don't know if that was Record of the Agorist War 2 Which is technically the third game Because the second game was the prequel
4585945	4588467	I'll tell you some of the games that are jumping out at me on the Vita.
4588807	4595071	BlazBlue has a Vita port as well which would explain why the release of the console ones is staggered a little bit.
4595551	4597472	Katamari Damacy has a Vita game coming out.
4597492	4603996	That I would recommend at launch because it's cheaper and it also has new levels and apparently it's pretty fun to play.
4604076	4604737	Michael Jackson
4605262	4613051	Ridge Racer Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Uncharted Golden Abyss Vita's got a really strong launch in Japan.
4613071	4614532	Also a Squeenix game called Lord of Apocalypse.
4627105	4629147	That's supposed to be awesome looking.
4629327	4631208	That's like half the games coming out.
4631308	4639854	So it's going to be interesting to see how the launch compares to the 3DS launch when 3DS didn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's a lot stronger now.
4640594	4642075	The PSP is not forgotten.
4642756	4645157	Just for DarkSakura, they are releasing on the PSP.
4645197	4646358	It's actually the DarkSakura edition.
4646378	4646858	No, I'm just kidding.
4647218	4651121	But it is Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd Low Price Edition.
4651621	4652582	Yay!
4652882	4654003	Budget Bin Edition.
4654023	4654283	Woo!
4657180	4675819	trying to look at the Nintendo systems real quick seeing what the 3DS is countering with this week against the Vita Puyo Puyo Anniversary Pins Collection and Inazuma 11 Go Dark version and Shine version both are out this week from level 5
4679205	4679946	That's a sports game.
4680866	4682087	Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.
4682127	4684309	So a very busy week in Japan.
4684469	4686471	Not so busy in the UK.
4687011	4689593	On the 12th we have Gears of War 3, Ram's Shadow.
4690294	4694157	On the 13th is Flat Out 3, Chaos and Destruction for PC.
4694938	4699341	And also on the PC on the 15th of December is X3, Albion Prelude.
4700782	4701483	That's about it.
4704488	4706290	I can't tell you what's coming out the week after that, though.
4707671	4708332	The Old Republic.
4710494	4710935	All right.
4711175	4713117	We're going to get into some more news here in just a minute.
4713557	4716640	We're actually, just for the podcast, folks, we lost our live feed.
4716680	4717461	Winamp crashed.
4717501	4719724	That happens a lot lately around here.
4719744	4720164	Freaking Winamp.
4720184	4721405	I can't figure out what's going on.
4721425	4722967	If it's not Comcast, it's Winamp.
4723027	4725249	I think they're in cahoots.
4725810	4726811	They're in cahoots.
4727211	4727732	Perhaps.
4728132	4729272	I love that word, Kahoot.
4729873	4731253	Making new versions of Winamp?
4731473	4733233	I think they do still make versions of Winamp.
4733273	4740295	But anyway, we should be reconnected, so apologies to the live listeners, and hopefully we didn't lose you guys during the... I don't know how long we were down.
4740356	4745957	I was so into reading those Japanese releases that Winamp could have been down for five minutes for all I know, so I apologize.
4746137	4750538	Rob was really looking at it with such intensity on his face that I thought he was going to pop a vein.
4751719	4752079	Seriously?
4753519	4754179	Alright, wow.
4754259	4755540	I think it was down for some time.
4755580	4756040	Sorry, guys.
4756943	4758249	Rob Vail, Fired
4760077	4761018	No, you're not fired.
4761258	4762058	Or you're rehired.
4762138	4763679	I could fire you once and then rehire you.
4763999	4764260	Alright.
4765060	4767862	Let's move on with some more gaming news now that we have our live listeners back.
4767902	4769323	Sorry, you just missed the release dates.
4769983	4770343	Sorry.
4770383	4772404	Yeah, there's like not much coming out.
4772465	4773905	No, there's a shit ton in Japan.
4774806	4776827	US and UX, UK, not so much.
4776907	4780709	Japan has the Vita release and a bunch of other stuff to go with it.
4781090	4785532	People in Japan, send Jamie a Vita so she can review it and talk about you.
4785592	4789215	I thought about buying a Vita from Japan and I saw that it was $600 and I'm like, fuck that.
4789335	4789675	Ooh.
4789975	4790575	No way.
4790595	4791336	I'm sorry.
4791556	4791976	All right.
4792196	4793417	A couple more news stories for you guys.
4793437	4796338	Then the classic game of the week and, of course, our Mario competition soon.
4797338	4803942	So Capcom is actually bringing over some Japanese indie games to PC for North America and Europe.
4804722	4807343	And they're going to be doing some cool stuff.
4807383	4813266	This is with a partnership deal with New Media, NYU, not New.
4814806	4823409	And I guess they're going to be doing some neat, like, a lot of, they call them retro chic arcade shooters.
4824429	4832971	For example, they've got, looks like Satsa, I can't even pronounce this, Satasius.
4833971	4834612	Satasius?
4834772	4835692	Satasius, yes.
4836632	4837372	That's going to be coming out.
4837392	4847997	That's available, I guess, as well on December 20th via Steam, Direct2Drive, GamersGate, and other major digital distribution services for $6.
4848397	4865704	And then coming early 2012, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, Ether Vapor Remaster, Fighting Fairy, Exceed Second, Vampire Rex, and Exceed Third, Jade Penetrate Black Package.
4866221	4895545	I'd play Fighting Fairy and I'm going to take a wild guess and say those probably the last two there are shmup games because it kind of sounds very you're a shmup and yes I would be accurate on that usually very complicated titles Cherry Tree High Comedy Club if that's a shmup I'm going to laugh nope of course not but that would be a funny name for a shmup Fighting Fairy is the best name ever
4896997	4897618	FightingFairy
4918172	4922858	Alright, moving on to just one more story here and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4922899	4932852	But first I want to talk about Dogs and Cats Living Together, Mass Hysteria, OMG, a Microsoft app on an iOS device that makes it look like a Windows phone, sort of.
4933072	4933332	What?
4933512	4933972	Here's the deal.
4934352	4940194	My Xbox Live is a new app that is on the iOS App Store, and it's a way for you to integrate with the new Xbox.
4940934	4946056	And this is nice because there were some fan-created apps or whatever or unofficial apps that were decent.
4946396	4952937	But now we have something kind of official, and you can get on this app, and you can see what friends are online, what they're playing, compare achievements, all that stuff.
4953137	4955618	And what I think is kind of neat, you can send messages.
4956138	4958859	You can actually send messages through the app to people on their Xbox.
4958879	4958959	Okay.
4959019	4959760	Can you play with your avatar?
4959880	4964104	So, like, if Loki isn't listening... I think you can actually customize your avatar on that, too.
4964144	4964985	You can, you can.
4965025	4965465	Downloading.
4965705	4973232	If Loki isn't listening to you because he's too busy throwing carrots in Skyrim, you can actually pop it up on his screen through your iOS phone.
4973472	4975014	Stop throwing carrots, damn it!
4975254	4978837	Stop the carrots and pick up the phone and call me, or something, you know, something like that.
4979298	4979978	So that's pretty cool.
4980499	4983041	And you can also delete friends from your phone.
4983362	4983622	Woo-hoo!
4984022	4985023	Yay!
4985564	4986905	All these people I don't know.
4987385	4988006	The app is free.
4988887	4989387	So there you go.
4989487	4990568	I should go download it now.
4991008	4993451	And the app is also available on Windows phones.
4993551	4994211	Of course.
4994732	4995232	Of course.
4995673	4998595	But it was just kind of funny that it made its way to the iOS app as well.
4998936	5003059	And I believe the Windows phone app will do slightly more.
5003159	5007163	I think you can actually look through the catalogs of movies and apps and all that.
5007183	5009445	You can queue up movies and control your Xbox using that.
5009565	5009745	IOS App
5038266	5043011	BlackWolf says it's sluggish even on an iPad 2.
5043572	5044293	Makes me sad.
5044373	5045194	No voice messages.
5045594	5045935	That's true.
5045955	5047016	You can't do voice messages.
5047536	5053984	I just realized this recently, but the Kinect wires your whole damn room as a microphone.
5054384	5067753	I can't find the charger for my little wireless headset I had for my Xbox so I have no headset right now because the cat ate Alan's so all we have is the Kinect and when I'm playing Apples to Apples I can just talk to people You can't find the charger?
5067853	5081182	I think I have a spare headset That would be awesome The cats apparently live on a diet of headphone wires and treats They do it when we go to Disneyland and don't take them That's how they act out
5081582	5083783	My cat likes to eat our artificial tree.
5083844	5085925	She's just gnawing on it with the cords and stuff.
5085945	5092329	It reminds me of Christmas Vacation with the cat chewing on the cords and plugging in, hey, the Christmas tree's off.
5092349	5095551	I don't think they chewed on anything when I cat sat last time.
5097165	5100629	DarkSakura will dive into the vault headfirst and find a classic game that she says, Hey!
5115433	5122478	Listen up, you kids, with your Skyrim and your I-can't-believe-it's-not-Microsoft-on-an-Apple-phone-stuffs.
5122998	5124359	You need to go back to simpler times.
5124399	5126401	We didn't have no cell phone to manage friends lists.
5126681	5127882	We didn't have friends lists.
5128622	5130143	Yeah, we just had friends.
5130183	5131704	Back in the days of the Genesis.
5132665	5133665	Yeah, we didn't play online.
5133705	5135747	We just had people at our house and they ate all our pizza.
5136007	5142391	So Dark Sakura, if the kids today want to know what life was like back then, she's going to handpick one game that she thinks your kids should play.
5142852	5144553	Dark Sakura, what is the classic of the week this week?
5144983	5145563	Magic Knight Rayearth
5174656	5180578	Okay, that's enough.
5180638	5185220	Play the Japanese one now.
5185900	5187240	That music's gonna make me poop.
5188001	5189821	Alright, here's the Japanese one.
5194943	5195304	Come on.
5196104	5196464	There you go.
5199995	5205437	Isn't that better?
5206257	5206778	Not really.
5206858	5208618	She sounds more like a cat in that one.
5208638	5210799	Well, okay.
5211399	5211739	Anyway.
5213180	5214460	They had an even worse version.
5214841	5215861	And people complained so much.
5215881	5216621	What, the German one?
5216961	5217182	No.
5219022	5220583	Just play music from the game.
5220763	5221343	Alright, fine.
5221363	5223224	Here is music from Magic Knight Raid.
5223868	5227669	Well, anyway, there was a big anime series called Magic Knight Rayearth, which was really awesome.
5228109	5231151	The game was one of the pet projects of Working Designs.
5231851	5235212	And it was the last Saturn game that was released in the United States.
5236132	5238473	And it actually did not get localized for Europe.
5240274	5245315	So this was a really, really big deal when it came out.
5246016	5249717	Especially since Working Designs put so much effort into everything.
5250257	5255299	But at any rate, as far as an RPG goes, it was actually a very fun little RPG.
5255339	5261140	You had different puzzles, and you sort of played as a tag team of your three main characters.
5261740	5265482	You had Hikaru, Umi, and Fu.
5266522	5272024	Basically, they got kidnapped into Sephiroth to save the world as the Magic Knights.
5273704	5278387	If you haven't seen the anime, then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because it's based off the anime, of course.
5279568	5282890	So you upgrade through story progression.
5283490	5287473	However, you do get HP and MP.
5287553	5291235	You know, your hit points and magic points are increased by finding items.
5291275	5294717	But most of the character progress is done through story progression.
5294737	5295758	Okay.
5298035	5300937	It had really decent voice acting, I thought.
5301678	5303219	It was all people from Redding, by the way.
5303959	5304419	Did you know that?
5304760	5306121	Because Working Designs is based out of Redding.
5306881	5307281	Really?
5307622	5307842	Yep.
5307962	5309063	There ain't shit in Redding.
5309423	5310003	You know what else?
5310323	5310544	What?
5311004	5315807	Our Twilight Zone pinball was owned by the head of Working Designs.
5316347	5316768	Oh, awesome.
5317128	5317628	We got it from him.
5317648	5320110	That's why we have one of the Goemon dolls from the game that never came out.
5321107	5322569	Anyway, back to this.
5325191	5327073	They have different weapons, each of the Magic Knights does.
5327593	5331217	Hikaru has fire magic and she has a sword.
5332358	5336942	Umi uses a fencing foil and her powers are all water and ice.
5337663	5340005	I mean, her name is Umi, which means sea.
5341006	5344548	and, uh, who is a bow and arrow and wind and healing power.
5344648	5346309	So pretty cool.
5346569	5353773	Um, who actually I think is probably one of the most useful, you know, cause when she gets her upgrade, um, she has this lock on arrow thing.
5353813	5354433	So it's pretty cool.
5355718	5369412	So anyway, with the game that came out, Working Designs put a lot of effort into it, as they do with most everything they put out, because they've done a lot of treasure games, they've done a lot of Sega CD RPGs that we never thought that we would get.
5371114	5379542	So when they did this, they actually, for the whole opening sequence, they did, for anyone who's seen the anime, the logo is formed out of these gems, and
5379762	5391273	and so they had a new logo made in English that came the same way except Media Blasters had the rights to Rare at the time they designed their own logo and so they had to use that one.
5394056	5401543	The other problem too is that most of the source code for the Japanese version was lost due to a hard drive crash.
5402544	5403325	They had to rebuild the game.
5403345	5403445	Wow.
5405046	5411707	Yeah, so the code that they were missing had to be completely rebuilt, like I just said.
5412928	5415068	They did three different versions of the opening song.
5416308	5420309	They were not allowed to use the original for the English release.
5421689	5425730	So they had one with completely different lyrics.
5425930	5429251	They had the one that's in the game, and then there was an instrumental.
5430391	5437375	And, um, but the CD that came out with everything had all the different versions on it.
5437695	5440817	There was one that was just really hideous, by the way.
5441958	5444599	So yeah, there were other Rayearth games for the record.
5444659	5450362	There was a Game Boy one that was Rayearth 2nd, The Missing Colors.
5450843	5453124	Mahokishi Rayearth 2nd, The Missing Colors is what it was.
5453964	5456165	The Super Famicom, and two for the Game Gear.
5457046	5458787	The second one was called Making a Magic Knight.
5459287	5462189	But the only one that came out in the U.S.
5462209	5464330	was the Saturday game.
5466531	5472975	I have to say, because I've played through some of the Japanese ones, and I've played the entirety of the U.S.
5473075	5473215	ones.
5473875	5476236	And there was a big improvement made, and I'll tell you what it was.
5477056	5487998	In the Japanese one, every time you walked up to an item, and it does this in the US one, you've got dialogue, they make a comment on everything, except in the Japanese one, they said their comment too.
5488639	5491739	And it's like, wait to load, wait to load, wait to load.
5491879	5494080	They really fixed some of the loading time issues.
5494758	5504802	And on top of that, the packaging was amazing, and each of the desks, um, well, I would say that they had three different variations of the desks, one with Hikaru, one with Mii, one with Fu on it.
5505562	5507083	And I think I have the Mii one?
5507563	5509183	I think my friend has the Hikaru one.
5510144	5510904	Oh, Hikari, sorry.
5511724	5512945	Um, but anyway, um...
5514466	5516247	It was really good.
5516287	5522572	I mean, there were a lot of people who just thought it was kind of dull, you know, because, I mean, it was a three-year-old game when it came out over here.
5523312	5531038	But I think that if you're into a classic and fun RPG, this one's definitely one to check out if you can find it.
5531978	5532699	That's the other thing.
5532799	5534780	It was the last Saturn game released in the U.S.
5535481	5536221	It might be hard to find.
5537542	5537882	Slightly.
5538243	5538523	Slightly.
5539460	5539740	All right.
5539921	5542703	We can... It wasn't bad.
5543244	5544265	All right, there it is.
5544706	5546047	Your classic game of the week.
5546127	5546708	It wasn't bad.
5546928	5549831	Magic Knight Rayearth for the Saturn.
5551112	5553034	I did not know that they were all based in Reading.
5553374	5554356	You know what else is in Reading?
5554876	5555417	Trees.
5556237	5556898	And lots of them.
5557879	5560420	Alright, we are going to take a quick break here.
5560760	5562741	And it's going to go down in Mario Kart right now.
5562801	5564001	Get your DS's open.
5564741	5566902	Connect to the OL Army room.
5566942	5568262	Hopefully you've already added it there.
5568302	5569183	And we're going to get it started.
5569243	5570883	We're going to start it live here in just a minute.
5570903	5573444	But I'm going to break for the podcasties.
5573544	5574924	Put in a quick little break.
5574964	5576785	And we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5576825	5577685	Don't go anywhere though, guys.
5578005	5579886	We've got plenty more coming up in Part B tonight.
5579906	5583187	We've got The Last Story is coming to Europe.
5583327	5585988	And we're going to talk more about that and what it could possibly mean for America.
5586588	5593533	and of course a long time coming mailbag and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5600549	5604152	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5604192	5609557	We are live with the second half of our 438th episode for this December the 11th of 2011.
5610538	5616624	Alright, I know you're all dying to know how the Mario Kart match with the whopping four people that joined in time went.
5616964	5620347	Okay, so first race, I got last place.
5622669	5624531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5637782	5639282	for most of the race.
5639523	5640303	For most of the race.
5640323	5647625	But then I did a stupid thing and I tried to take the detour over to the big ramp, but you really, we were in the Calamari, or was it Calamari?
5648325	5651046	Cala something desert level with the train.
5651086	5652527	It's from the Nintendo 64 one.
5653547	5657948	And I tried to take the shortcut, but the shortcut only works if you have a mushroom.
5658369	5663230	And Black Wolf pulled ahead of me by mere inches and won the whole thing.
5663290	5664110	Curse you, Black Wolf!
5664851	5665251	Curse you!
5666451	5687102	so but I got second place at least although somebody I think was Zether or somebody damn near took over right there at the end but I was able to just inch out a second place so that's much better than the last place I did the first time so all right so there you have it there's your Mario Kart wrap-up we'll try that again next week Loki's gonna bring his 3ds next week right Loki and then hopefully some of you guys can chat some more you'll be able to
5687902	5688883	I had to get the game.
5689123	5692245	I don't think you can do I don't think you can do online play with download.
5692305	5693145	Probably not with download, no.
5693165	5693546	But that's alright.
5693566	5695046	You'll have the game by next week.
5695086	5698548	I've been planning on picking it up but I was gonna do it this weekend but I just didn't get around to it.
5698768	5699029	Alright.
5699529	5700529	So there you go.
5701130	5704151	So I was like third place overall with the fourth place and second place.
5704532	5705372	So I wasn't last.
5705612	5706533	I think Tiger Claw was last.
5706553	5706933	Sorry buddy.
5707824	5708424	Might have been Zether.
5708444	5708705	I don't know.
5708725	5709465	I wasn't really paying attention.
5709845	5710105	All right.
5712467	5713847	Anyhow, let's move on.
5713867	5715228	We're going to get back into the show here.
5715608	5717069	We got plenty more news to talk about.
5717570	5719671	And, of course, we have your calls, your emails.
5720279	5723861	Lots of emails tonight and plenty more to come.
5724181	5725122	So let's get back into some news.
5725202	5725482	Loki.
5726442	5726842	All right.
5726942	5731985	Well, let's talk a little bit about Grand Theft Auto because we haven't done enough of that since I stopped playing.
5733586	5738388	Grand Theft Auto 3 coming out on mobile devices next week for $5.
5740149	5759170	and the course that will be out on iOS and also Android marketplaces and is supported by most of the recent devices including the Apple iPad 1 and 2, iPhone 4 and 4S and the 4th generation iPod Touch which thankfully I have.
5760251	5776810	and also Android phones, the HTC ReSound LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Droid X2, Motorola Photon 4G, Samsung Galaxy R and T-Mobile G2X and of course some of the more recent tablets.
5779292	5791706	and it looks fun hopefully the controls work out pretty well and definitely worth picking up if you've you know I don't know if it supports any like bluetooth controllers they're pretty awesome but I'm kind of curious to see how the game looks
5794446	5807866	5 bucks so that'll be out on the 15th and there's a neat rumor going around for the circle pad that's coming out for the 3DS apparently it's gonna run on a AAA battery for 480 hours
5809989	5813971	That's some interesting... That's 20 days.
5814771	5816171	Yeah, that's a long time.
5816512	5817792	And shit, you know what?
5818452	5826515	Nintendo, you need to learn something about battery life because, man, those Wii remotes eat batteries like nothing.
5826995	5827656	And this thing...
5829217	5834281	I mean, I guess it just has an IR relay in it, so maybe it just doesn't take that much.
5835142	5838625	But even if that's true, even half that would be pretty good.
5840586	5843389	Nice to know that at least someone will replace batteries like crazy.
5844009	5844730	Because I'm not buying it.
5847973	5855239	And finally, Grasshopper and Digital Reality, they have a game coming out called Cynemora.
5855319	5856700	I'm not sure how they're pronouncing it.
5857325	5860006	and it's now going to be an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive.
5860046	5866689	It was supposed to be kind of a horizontal shmup game that was with 3D graphics and stuff and kind of a little bit different than Grasshopper.
5866729	5870871	I mean, it's not strange like a lot of the stuff that they normally put out.
5872392	5883997	So that's kind of cool that it's going to be coming out exclusively though on Xbox Live Arcade and not sure now if this is going to be a timed exclusive or if it's going to be exclusive permanently but
5885578	5887080	Diabolical Pitch House of the Dead Baseball
5903175	5909203	Where you're throwing baseballs at zombies and hitting stuff.
5909443	5913649	Okay, that's kind of more of the Grasshopper stuff where it's just really weird.
5914109	5915171	But pretty cool.
5915451	5918615	They need to adapt Battlefield Baseball because that was a fucking awesome movie.
5920733	5920953	All right.
5921033	5921273	Oops.
5922293	5923254	I'm not ready for that story yet.
5923294	5923674	Be quiet.
5923814	5924034	All right.
5926154	5928855	Moving on with some more news, some rapid-fire news.
5928875	5931495	Well, I guess I'll start with that since the music popped up in the background here.
5932335	5933776	What you're hearing there, that's the music.
5933896	5935936	I think this is music from the port.
5936056	5946918	It's a Commodore 64 port of the game Canabalt, which to me looks a lot like Bit.Trip Racer or the Magic Unicorn game, Comedy Central, that's on the iPhone.
5947378	5949509	Yeah, this was kind of the first of that series, I think.
5949670	5950976	Yeah, but the music kicks ass.
5951036	5951519	Listen to this.
5959955	5960716	That kicks a lot of ass.
5960756	5963678	Now, I don't think that's actually the Commodore 64 rendering that.
5963718	5969223	I think that's an MP3, but that's the type of stuff that 64 would make, and that's a pretty badass-sounding song.
5969543	5971785	But yeah, somebody has actually ported the game to the Commodore 64.
5972166	5972826	That is awesome.
5973567	5985097	So you can Google that to find it, because the link's a little bit complicated, but it's C64ANABALT, and it's being distributed pretty much as freeware, so you can play it in an emulator or what have you.
5986037	5986898	or just look at the YouTube.
5986958	5990941	It's YouTube user Heavy Stylist and you can just hear that sweet music that's playing there in the background.
5991821	5993523	Alright, some other news for you guys.
5994443	5996785	Somebody dared to sue Beyonce last year.
5996925	5997425	Remember this?
5997485	5999907	A $100 million lawsuit against Beyonce.
6000147	6008213	There was supposed to be a music game that was going to be created all around her but I guess for whatever reason she stopped it and 70 people lost their jobs over the whole thing.
6008553	6036609	well you know think about it they have that Black Eyed Peas game there's an ABBA dance game I mean it's not there's Michael Jackson so it's not unheard of that Beyonce might have her own dance game but it was stopped and they're now suing Beyonce for a hundred million dollars and I think a lot of people went ha ha ha that'll be a laugh well guess what the lawsuit was around allowed to move forward it was not thrown out of court so interesting to see what happens with this as it moves further
6037537	6038037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6053228	6059849	There is a new cell phone, smartphone version of Dance Dance Revolution that's going to come out here next year.
6060210	6070112	It doesn't have a name yet, but they're saying it's going to be DDR, and it's supposed to have an emphasis on social gaming, which is ironic because this whole show started because DarkSakura, Loki, and I all met playing DDR.
6070132	6071912	It was a very social thing when it was in arcades.
6072332	6074873	I don't know how you're going to play DDR on your phone.
6075573	6081414	I think it'll be more like a response to Tap Tap Revenge, which is clearly inspired by this title, if you know what I'm saying.
6081994	6082474	DarkSakura!
6106627	6108188	Tech and Tag Tournament 2
6129284	6132125	Also, it's supposed to be coming to consoles.
6132765	6133586	It says holiday 2012.
6134106	6135547	There's a bunch of holidays.
6135827	6137027	So it's probably going to be Arbor Day.
6138928	6144750	Also, Mario Kart 7 sold 420,000 units its first week in Japan.
6145390	6148392	And Iwata said that it did even better across the world.
6149212	6150172	So that's pretty good, huh?
6150853	6151253	Very nice.
6152493	6153213	Good news for the 3DS.
6155174	6159236	Last bit, we have some good news for rock band fans.
6159696	6160057	Rush!
6160837	6161417	Yay!
6161857	6167120	It's the Rush Pack 01 that has Fly By Night, Caravan, and the Spirit of Radio, the live version.
6167360	6173063	And then individual songs, Rebel Love Song by Black Veil, Brides, and Warrior's Call by Volbeat.
6174143	6180846	And there is a pro bass and guitar expansion available for Fly By Night and the Spirit of Radio.
6183688	6184188	I like Rush.
6185615	6186276	Rush is a good band.
6186296	6190699	That was one of the songs that I was using to test out everything was Tom Sawyer.
6191280	6191580	Nice.
6191740	6193461	I was like, I can't sing that high.
6194762	6195363	It was pretty funny.
6196750	6197110	All right.
6197571	6209519	Well, we're going to get back into some long gaming news here with Loki, but I wanted to plug this first because I promised in chat earlier, Derek, one of the other hosts here at All Games Radio, who does his own show, Dead Pixel Live, wanted me to plug this.
6209579	6215603	And I said, sure, because I said last time when we didn't participate because none of us had the game, we would try to do the next one.
6215643	6218825	And I think the prospects for us participating here look much better.
6219365	6221487	It is the Big Battle Beatdown.
6221647	6223068	It is a fighting game tournament.
6223688	6250232	That's going to take place against a bunch of radio shows I don't think it's just restricted to all games I think Derek's going to try and get whoever he can to be a part of this But certainly we would like the OL Army to be a presence If you want more information, more information is available at thebigbattle.net I haven't had enough time since I just kind of found out about this tonight I haven't had enough time to go through and look at all the specifics But I can see that there are several games that will be involved here Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat as in the new one
6250712	6255235	Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
6255576	6257357	So a couple Street Fighters and a couple Mortal Kombats.
6257597	6258658	I kind of like the way that was done.
6258698	6260399	You have the new one and you have the classic one.
6260839	6267864	So whether you're a new gaming fan or a classic gaming fan, there's something for you here where you can represent the OL Army.
6267944	6268725	So that'll be fun.
6268845	6270166	I don't know what platform...
6270706	6283003	the games are on or if it's gonna they're gonna do it multi-platform style somehow or if it's like gotta all be on 360 but we'll try to get Derek on in the coming weeks and I think this is not starting until next year so soon
6285120	6285560	Thanks for watching!
6308422	6310524	Derek might be in chat too to clarify some of this later.
6311185	6313307	But I want to give a plug for that because I do want to participate.
6313887	6316410	So prepare to get your ass kicked, DarkSakura.
6316890	6317170	All right.
6317531	6317831	What?
6317851	6320413	I'm going to kick your ass in the big battle.
6320433	6321234	No, leave my ass alone.
6321274	6321574	Yes, I am.
6321855	6322115	All right.
6322475	6323736	Let's get back to some other gaming news.
6323796	6324057	Loki.
6326058	6330142	It's been announced that the last story is coming to Europe.
6330763	6337149	Another one of the Project Rainfall games ported over to English for European players.
6337389	6338790	It's coming out February 24th.
6339431	6345456	And, of course, no announcement about a North American release, but...
6346337	6348738	Hey, at least you get another game, Europeans.
6349818	6350879	Another Mistwalker game.
6352279	6353519	And that's fantastic.
6353560	6354400	Apparently it's pretty good.
6354600	6357901	That means there will be an English translation ready for America to Pirate.
6358701	6359402	Very soon.
6360982	6364683	Which is what I plan to do if they don't announce this anytime soon for the US.
6365204	6370525	If they're willing to put the US version out within three months or so, the US or Europe release, I'll wait.
6370645	6372326	I don't understand why they can't announce that.
6372586	6377050	I mean, they could say, hey, you know, we have, I mean, they're doing the English translation already.
6377370	6377530	Right.
6377610	6389881	Once again, I mean, it requires either no translation or maybe one person working on it for maybe a week at the most to translate English English to U.S.
6390101	6391683	English or American English.
6392103	6394645	And honestly, it's find replace.
6394865	6398969	I mean, it's so stupid that you know what a jumper is.
6400609	6401129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6422870	6423730	Seriously.
6423930	6426331	How many Final Fantasies have we had?
6426371	6426952	A bajillion?
6427892	6431233	This is the Final Fantasy as of right now.
6431253	6432074	We're up to 13-2 of them.
6432114	6432774	Oh no, wait, we have 14.
6432814	6433414	We have 13-2.
6433454	6436655	We have 0, and we have 10-2, and we have Mystic Quest and crap.
6441724	6443025	We have a lot of spin-offs.
6443446	6444327	It's just, whatever.
6444367	6445748	You counted Mystic Quest.
6446509	6447150	You played it.
6447830	6453196	Actually, I ain't even gonna lie, I loved Mystic Quest, but a majority of that was, the music was really good.
6453276	6456319	For not having been done by Nobuo Uematsu, the music in Mystic Quest is great.
6456740	6456960	Anyhow.
6457360	6458742	But, yeah, like, you know,
6460225	6461966	I'm not going to beg and plead for the last story.
6462367	6473214	And honestly, if it's not something that they just decide, hey, we're just going to put this out, you know, I'm hoping that there's an announcement within like a week or two because it's ridiculous otherwise.
6473334	6477957	I mean, all you're going to do, I mean, unless, are they just going to wait and see?
6478257	6487364	No, they can't wait and see how the sales are of, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles or whatever it is because it's not coming out until April.
6487484	6489305	So, you know, I don't know.
6489682	6490382	Thanks for watching!
6506229	6506590	DarkSakura.com
6524088	6552396	that's honestly how I feel about it like if you don't want my money then fine I won't give it to you but I'm sick of this whole like what they're doing with Xenoblade is just I mean I still don't know what to do about that whole thing like I really want to buy it and support it because it's a great game but I'm really irritated and I think ultimately the end of the day I'll buy it well I'm irritated at two things one I'm irritated that it's this whole exclusive thing with the evil G which I hate however I do understand you can order it from Nintendo.com so if
6552976	6555741	If it's Nintendo shipping it to me and not Evil G, then I'll do it.
6555781	6556663	It's still stupid, though.
6556703	6558366	Why is it exclusive to a retailer?
6558406	6561932	I mean, I understand that they may have ponied up money to help import it over.
6562353	6562633	Fine.
6562733	6563074	Whatever.
6563094	6563354	That's fine.
6563374	6565258	That shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.
6565922	6567023	Yeah, actually, you're right.
6568203	6573126	A company shouldn't have had to say, hey, Nintendo, we're going to pay you money to localize it over here.
6573306	6574726	You don't have to fucking localize it.
6574767	6584211	You have to bring it over here, and you send a copy of the ESRB so it can get rated, which is just standard, and you just put it out over here because you're publishing it.
6584231	6585412	It's first-party publishing.
6586452	6589314	Case in point, and I don't think anybody can talk me out of this one.
6589614	6591375	DarkSakura is on the Orange Lounge Tumblr right now.
6591475	6595898	OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com Looking at a game called Magical Jewel Pet or something like that.
6596458	6602222	If this can be, if somebody's paying for this to come out on the DS, then somebody can pay for Xenoblade.
6602602	6612609	And you can't convince me that Xenoblade, there's something to it that makes it a bigger, more expensive to do because it's already been translated.
6612729	6613570	I don't understand.
6614410	6616972	Like there's so much shovelware that comes out on these systems.
6616992	6618393	There's no room for Xenoblade in this.
6620090	6627657	I don't understand what the... If you've got it translated into English... I mean, I understand if it's a Japanese game that they're just not going to translate into English.
6628057	6632361	Okay, yes, there's an issue there that bringing it over here may be unrealistic.
6632661	6637985	But if they're already translating it to English and releasing it in a different part of the world...
6639252	6640252	I don't understand.
6640352	6642473	There's no work you need to do.
6642733	6643653	It's done.
6643753	6645114	It's English already.
6645154	6647115	You don't need to translate anything.
6647135	6656077	You can't... I mean, last time I checked, when you put translate English to English and Google Translate, it comes out the same.
6656758	6660019	So I don't understand what they would need to do.
6660419	6660999	Can I ask this too?
6661059	6662980	What's wrong with a region-free system?
6665141	6667043	Why can't our system just be region free?
6667143	6671066	Has Sony Playstation 3 been hurting because it's region free?
6671606	6679653	Are we having rampant issues like just tons and tons of people getting all their games from Japan because of the region free thing?
6680133	6681114	what's the big fucking deal?
6681154	6708755	I would think if anything it helps them out the only time that they may have issues where they're maybe losing out a little bit and not everyone's going to go import stuff because it's expensive to import something you're paying almost twice the amount of money that you would pay to buy it locally and just for but a lot of times people are buying stuff that's not going to come out over here or RPGs that they want a special edition of or something like that that's not coming out in the United States or North America or whatever
6709976	6713517	And I mean, there's some European games that get released over there first.
6713897	6719558	You know, like there's maybe some Eidos games or Square Enix games that are going to be released over there.
6720038	6722878	Yeah, I'm fine with Europe getting the game a little early.
6722958	6726159	I mean, shit, they get screwed with stuff for us all the time.
6726599	6728119	And for them, this is a great thing.
6728199	6729100	So I get it.
6729120	6736621	But it's just kind of one of those whole things where it's like, you know, at some point they have to realize, thanks to the Internet, we live in a global world today.
6736761	6745127	I mean, so far, all the Sony systems from, like, the PSP, the PS3, and now the Vita is supposed to be region-free.
6745207	6750451	I mean, the DS was region-free, and then they decided, eh, let's poo-poo on that.
6751092	6758817	And now, you know, the 3DS, I'm just waiting for them to come out with something to, you know, like a card reader for the 3DS.
6758897	6760278	I'm sure there's one out there already.
6760338	6761259	I haven't looked, but...
6763120	6763640	Thanks for watching!
6783027	6783908	A few years ago.
6784168	6787130	That actually came out in Europe a lot earlier than it came out over here.
6787390	6797378	Not necessarily a game that you would want to get early, but if you wanted to play a God of War knockoff game, and it was pretty fun, earlier than you would get it here in the States, you could.
6797858	6799459	If you wanted to pay the money to have it imported.
6800840	6801941	I mean, I don't know.
6801961	6807205	I've done that before with some of the other Final Fantasy games, but not necessarily on PS3.
6808294	6810917	Alright, I feel like it's just another week and it's the same old rant.
6810937	6812058	When will Nintendo learn?
6812258	6812879	I don't know.
6812939	6817164	Because it seems like Nintendo is also the biggest offender when it comes to Europe getting things late too.
6817184	6819686	Nintendo needs to get their shit together with global releases.
6819706	6820607	Here's my problem though with this.
6820747	6829577	I don't want to buy this game because one, I understand if I buy the game that's supporting the fact that niche games like this do have a place in the United States.
6830658	6831739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6849598	6876947	and and I have a feeling though a lot of these other publishers are kind of doing this Capcom um and they're just making people jump through hoops to get a fucking game out of here for a franchise not necessarily a franchise right here but I mean this is a game that's gonna do well with the RPG crowd I mean you can't expect this to be Final Fantasy like I mean hell a Final Fantasy game or something like that is not gonna appeal to everyone fuck Skyrim is not gonna appeal to everybody I mean mom and
6877407	6881791	Your people that are playing Wii Sports and stuff like that don't give a fuck about Skyrim.
6881811	6884014	They're just like... They blow their mind.
6884034	6885835	They're just like, I don't know what to do with this.
6885975	6886556	Too many buttons.
6887337	6887737	Exactly.
6887777	6888758	It's like my wife trying to play it.
6890039	6892962	I can't adjust the camera and move the character at the same time.
6894244	6895405	So, I mean, it just blows their mind.
6895445	6898888	So you can't look at it doing as well as a...
6901070	6901170	And... I...
6923061	6924503	Yeah, there's a lot of crap out there.
6924803	6925884	Alright, let's move on.
6925944	6927786	We gotta move on with more stories or we're gonna be here all night.
6927906	6930829	So I wanna talk about a story about the PlayStation Vita.
6931710	6934653	It's not about region free and all that stuff, but is the Vita region free?
6934673	6935154	I can't remember.
6935194	6936615	It's supposed to be.
6936635	6939938	They're saying that it is, but I don't think anyone's really gotten one.
6941300	6944864	Obviously, it's only out in one region and no one's really confirmed either way.
6944964	6945845	I think it is.
6946505	6947366	Alright, we'll find out soon.
6976244	6978485	Jamie and Dan share all their gaming systems, I'm sure.
6978685	6981026	Or Loki and Nelly share their gaming systems.
6981087	6981507	I don't share.
6984168	6985609	What system did you try to teach Nelly?
6985629	6987990	Was it Nelly's copy of Skyrim you tried to teach her to play?
6988010	6989611	No, I don't share portable systems.
6990393	6996376	Oh, see, well, Alan uses Netflix on the 3DS all the time.
6996676	7000197	Like, he uses Netflix more than I do because he really gets a lot of use out of the 3DS thing.
7000657	7007420	But then he'll also play my copy of Mario Kart on my save file, which is okay.
7007480	7007860	It's fine.
7007900	7008881	He's unlocking some stuff.
7009601	7013525	It works great for a game like Super Mario 3D Land where you have three save files.
7013985	7019149	I'm number one, he's number two, and if I ever let a friend come over and play the game, they can have save file number three.
7019169	7019650	It works out great.
7019690	7020030	Oh, that's right.
7020050	7021331	You told me to write over save file one.
7022452	7022853	Shut up.
7023333	7023753	It's true.
7023833	7031180	But anyway, my point is that some people do, especially couples and stuff will tend to share these systems a lot.
7031520	7037145	So when they heard that only one user per system, it was a little bit of an alarm.
7038436	7052931	However, there was a follow-up article that came out very quickly afterwards, and that is the official line from Sony America, quote, your PlayStation Network ID is bonded to your memory card, and your memory card is bonded to your Vita.
7054190	7059995	So, in other words, you can have multiple PlayStation Network accounts, each tied to a memory card.
7060316	7064219	But if you try to move the account from one card to another, it's going to get more interesting.
7065460	7069504	And we just had the story last week about all those memory cards, now freaking expensive they are.
7070184	7072927	So, it's like good news and bad news.
7073007	7075008	Good news, yes, you can't have more than one account.
7075069	7078111	Bad news, you're going to have to buy more memory cards to do it.
7078432	7081214	And then you can't just move them from one Vita to another, it sounds like.
7081778	7086522	Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't like the fact that they're tied to your Vita.
7086602	7090705	I don't see how that's necessary, because what's the point in having a memory card then?
7090745	7099512	I mean, I guess someone was saying, well, I can't take my memory card from one Vita and play it on my friend's Vita, but it's like, why would you do that?
7099552	7101154	Just take your Vita with you.
7102254	7105377	But I don't know if it's really a problem that a lot of people have.
7105557	7109700	It sucks that they're doing this, tying it to the system and stuff, because...
7110561	7128182	and it's just bad for Sony because this is a problem that will be solved by hacking unfortunately and only creating these problems creates people that want to find the solution for it and the solution's not good for Sony unfortunately
7129702	7133887	Alan's in chat right now and his feathers are a little ruffled at what I said about Mario Kart.
7133907	7138513	He says, Salacious Pops in chat saying, well, I always win and unlock shit, so, you know.
7139374	7141937	Maybe he's better than you at drifting.
7142017	7142978	Yeah, perhaps.
7143178	7143579	Perhaps.
7143619	7143979	Shut up.
7144940	7147703	I almost considered asking you if I could play your second match.
7149324	7150085	Oh, I would have let you.
7150405	7151746	Oh, man.
7152106	7152747	Maybe next week.
7153007	7155829	If you don't have your own copy by then I'll let you race during the midpoint break.
7156390	7156910	Alright, anyway.
7157831	7165297	Also, I want to point out what Rob D. is saying in our chatroom at chat.orangeandre.com Yeah, Japan has a totally separate set of standards when it comes to this sort of thing.
7165337	7167819	They don't care whether lots of people buy their stuff.
7168159	7169480	They care about making money.
7169780	7172783	They will not price niche media and aim for the most sales.
7173083	7176546	They will price niche media for the passionate people and gouge them.
7179071	7180312	I mean, okay, listen.
7180572	7186015	Ironic, this is coming right after the Xenoblade last story stuff about gouging niche people.
7186255	7190657	Listen, I understand that the memory cards... Okay, the memory cards are what they are.
7190677	7197440	You're either gonna just buy one, just get over the fact that they're fucking expensive, and just buy one.
7197480	7198301	Because guess what?
7198481	7198681	The...
7199361	7209109	PSP Memory Stick Pro Duos were fucking expensive when they came out and that shit came down in price once other peripherals and stuff were using them.
7209970	7211451	Yes, it's a proprietary card.
7211511	7212271	Just get over it.
7212632	7215074	Buy your fucking 4 gig card or whatever the hell.
7215354	7221599	Trust me, you're not going to need more than 4 gigs for the system unless you're downloading a ton of games online.
7221639	7225622	In which case, you can think about maybe getting a bigger one later on.
7225662	7227243	For me, if I was going to get a Vita...
7228164	7251984	Whatever, I'm going to be the only one using the thing So it's not a big deal for me And yeah, it sucks for the people that want to share It's not the end of the world, in my opinion As far as, let's say at Alan and I's house Where we're both big gamers and nerds and stuff I can kind of say, obviously I'm getting a Vita I mean, no question, because I have to have all the nerd stuff And it's going to be, I think, a good system Got a lot of good games coming on it
7252344	7278843	as far as the save file goes I at least like the fact that you know we could get Alan a cheap little memory card for his saves and then he can have his own PlayStation Network ID or at the end of the day if it's really just save files I mean if a game will still give you three save slots or something on one memory card then you know or a lot of Sony games kind of let you save an unlimited number of files like I have like seven saves on White Knight Chronicles 2 just because it just keeps adding to the list Skyrim I think I have six or seven saves too these are all on PS3 so
7280764	7284427	He can just have his own saves, and I don't think he's going to really care about trophies on his own account.
7284447	7285107	Well, maybe he will.
7285147	7288429	Here's what I'm worried about, and here's the reason why they're doing this.
7289310	7296615	It's like on the PlayStation 3, if you download, say, download content or whatever, everybody I think on the console can use that download content.
7296635	7297996	Oh, no, I know where you're going with this.
7298296	7301758	And so now they're going to get you, oh, hey, you like that download content?
7301798	7302559	Well, fuck you.
7302599	7305421	You're going to have to buy it for yourself instead of sharing it.
7305461	7306682	That is kind of shitty, actually.
7306742	7309183	So that's kind of what they're doing, I think, with this.
7311124	7314185	But, like, once again, you know, listen, it is what it is.
7314285	7317167	You either just get over yourself.
7317187	7318167	You either support it or you don't.
7318207	7321208	Yeah, you either get over yourself and buy the system or not.
7321248	7324449	I mean, is that really going to hold you back that you've got to buy an expensive memory card?
7325690	7327651	I don't have to like it, and I can complain on the internet.
7328191	7331852	I mean, just deal with it, and that's it.
7331892	7338975	I mean, it sucks, and I'm sure there'll be a third-party workaround eventually, but, I mean, unless you really want to wait for that,
7339986	7340467	And you know what?
7340487	7342148	Hey, there's nothing wrong with waiting.
7342509	7343990	Yeah, everybody's going to be buying.
7344010	7346753	Well, not everybody, but a lot of people are going to be buying it at launch.
7346773	7347534	But guess what?
7347995	7348936	Prices come down.
7349016	7350357	There's bundles that come out later on.
7350397	7351479	You get a bunch of free shit.
7351559	7354822	So just wait if you're unsure about it.
7355042	7360368	Wait until the following holiday season and stuff, and you might score it even cheaper than it is now.
7361391	7366933	We're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute here, but I want to read one more comment from chat from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.
7367233	7367853	He's trolling.
7368413	7368773	Listen to this.
7368813	7374855	Bobby Blackwolf says in chat, You mean I could have beaten both Sky and Loki at Mario Kart?
7374875	7377476	I think he's throwing down the gauntlet there a little bit.
7380031	7382292	Could've, if you were good enough to beat me.
7386512	7386913	It's on.
7386933	7388573	It's already been brought in.
7388933	7389373	I like this.
7389553	7397435	I think we need to do more of this where we play games either right before, well, I don't want to say before because we don't want to step on Bobby's toes, maybe right after OLR during the midpoint break.
7397795	7400436	I like the idea that people can kind of play games, or even during the show.
7400476	7403596	Shit, I don't care if you're playing Mario Kart right now and listening to OLR.
7403616	7406537	We'll have to play after his show because we don't want him crying during his show.
7411958	7420343	Uh oh, uh oh, alright Moving on, on that note, let's get to the mailbag
7422270	7423791	Thousands and thousands of emails received.
7423951	7427713	You have to remember, this is the first mailbag since all the website outage stopped.
7428033	7429714	So our emails have been piling up.
7430094	7431755	So unfortunately, DarkSakura can only pick a few.
7432135	7439398	So DarkSakura has sifted through the mailbox, like it was kitty litter, has sifted through the mailbox and pulled out a few nuggets for you.
7440859	7441299	You know what?
7441840	7450504	There's this one Caturday picture that I kept seeing on the web of a cat standing up looking super surprised, saying, Someone keeps coming in and stealing my poop!
7452987	7454088	And you just made me think of that.
7454849	7455149	Great.
7455209	7456711	So let's see who's poop we've stolen.
7458944	7463186	The first one, hi OLR, it's me again, your friendly, catastrophic Magi.
7463246	7465147	I know it's been a while since I last emailed.
7465707	7474912	After listening to your last show and Robb Stark contrasting with Skyrim and Final Fantasy XIII, the two show clearly the difference between Western and Japanese RPGs.
7475392	7485937	Western RPGs mainly focus on character creation, you're lucky if you get to even pick a name in a JRPG, and world exploration, while JRPGs focus on story and character drama leading to a much more linear affair.
7486577	7489658	Also, Rob, have you played either of the first two Elder Scrolls games?
7490038	7492099	They're both now available as freeware.
7492179	7500182	If you think Skyrim is big, you should check out Daggerfall, which boasts a game world twice the size of Great Britain that would take over two full weeks to cross in real time.
7500222	7502403	Yeah, but it's all just an algorithm-generated thing.
7502943	7506484	Of course, it is all randomly generated, so it's all quite samey.
7508258	7513163	Before I go, I just wanted to pass on some preview footage of a game to you because I know how much you love the series.
7513784	7515986	I bet it will be 20% cooler than any other game.
7516106	7517087	Hear you later, Magi.
7517508	7518269	And it is...
7520316	7522016	Silent Ponyville, the game.
7522337	7522657	Nice.
7522817	7523637	Can you send me the link for that?
7524697	7525037	I guess.
7525057	7526018	Just copy, paste, and chat.
7526038	7527098	Silent Ponyville?
7527118	7527658	I want to see this.
7527678	7528338	Silent Ponyville.
7528358	7528998	Is it like Silent Hill?
7529078	7529518	Hold on.
7529638	7530979	But with my little pony or something?
7531519	7531799	All right.
7533299	7536860	And just real quick on the whole earlier Elder Scrolls games.
7536960	7540101	I haven't really played them a lot in depth, but I'm kind of familiar with them.
7540161	7544362	And I especially know the older PC RPGs, how they used to be.
7544382	7546183	They'd be vast, but the dungeons...
7546963	7549625	were quite as visual as they are now.
7549665	7553347	People like Skyrim because not only is it big, but it looks real.
7554028	7555389	The graphics are getting so good.
7556109	7557970	I'm going to fast forward here a little bit.
7558010	7558771	Silent Ponyville.
7560312	7561412	That's exactly what it is.
7561532	7563274	It's Silent Hill meets My Little Pony.
7566776	7569077	Is there a pyramid head in this that comes out and chops her head off?
7571119	7574341	This is like somebody's art project that they spent a lot of time making.
7575558	7576719	I'm not sure how to feel about this.
7578459	7579160	Next email.
7579240	7580020	Hi, OLR.
7580040	7588764	After hearing Loki rave about Ready Player One, I was all ears being myself a rather old gamer started with the C64.
7589204	7593546	So I bought myself a copy and have just started, but it really is a page turner.
7593706	7596107	If you have the chance, do get the author on your show.
7596187	7600209	I'm certain that that will result in a very interesting podcast.
7600569	7601950	Best regards from the UK, Mark.
7604870	7605391	We'll try.
7605651	7606952	I forgot to look into that, but we will.
7607673	7608474	Our listeners can read.
7608534	7609615	Yes, of course they can read.
7610056	7611277	How dare you insult the listeners.
7611318	7612939	He's from the UK, so I'm assuming he can read.
7614261	7615683	Therefore, he's more well-educated.
7616544	7617725	He's more smarter.
7617905	7618866	More smarter.
7619207	7620148	Better, gooder reader.
7621369	7622249	Um, okay.
7622389	7624670	Hey guys, this is Blade 3, aka Sam1.
7624870	7626350	Well, what are you, Blade 3 or Sam1?
7626570	7627511	Oh, no, Sam.
7628451	7630792	He's not using any punctuation, so whatever.
7631412	7637774	I just wanted to say to Loki that Laszlo on Integrity 2.0 Radio and GTA 4 sounds exactly like Rob.
7637814	7640034	It almost makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob.
7640554	7642575	Either way, I thought you would get a kick out of that.
7642615	7643435	Keep up the good work.
7643455	7644315	The show is fantastic.
7644335	7645356	I've been listening since I was five.
7645376	7646156	Thanks to you guys, by the way.
7646176	7649697	I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000, so cut some slack-o.
7650837	7651598	Exclamation point!
7652999	7657142	Seriously, that's the only... Okay, I'm going to reread this email the way it's written.
7657443	7657743	Alright.
7658303	7660805	Hey guys, this is Blade3, aka Sam.
7661506	7668092	I just wanted to say that Loki, Laszlo on Integrity 2.0 Radio and GTA 4 sounds exactly like Robert Melmus makes me think they modeled Laszlo after Rob either way.
7668432	7669533	I thought you would get a kick out of that.
7669573	7670173	Keep up the good work.
7670193	7670974	This show is fantastic.
7670994	7671915	I've been listening since 05.
7672275	7672655	Thanks guys.
7672675	7676679	By the way, I know my grammar and stuff sucks, but I'm emailing from a paper 2000, so cut some slack.
7677512	7705679	so cut some slack-o why aren't you cutting some slack-o I don't know what the fuck slack-o is I have heard the Lazlo comparison before actually, you're not the first to mention it funny enough, I haven't played enough Grand Theft Auto where I know that I know, it's like the one game series I don't play enough of so I'll just have to take your word for it I would love to loan my voice to a game sometime though maybe when they do Legend of the Magical Pony 2 alright
7707195	7708435	I want to be in a game, Rob.
7708715	7709616	I want to do voice acting.
7709636	7710777	I think it would be fun.
7711117	7713238	I think that we would be awesome voice actors.
7713398	7713999	I think so too.
7715439	7719362	What we should do, we should get a video game script and reenact it live on OLR.
7719602	7720202	We could do that.
7721763	7726586	If we wanted to get someone with a fun voice just on the show randomly, we should get Agro on here.
7727458	7730180	We should do dramatic reading of 8-bit video game scripts.
7730240	7731280	That would be great.
7731481	7731661	Yes.
7732341	7734583	But we should get Agro on here sometime to do his announcer voice.
7735183	7735623	Oh, God.
7736044	7736464	Oh, God.
7736504	7737344	That guy from WoW.
7737464	7737945	Oh, God.
7737965	7739085	So cool.
7739145	7739706	Hello.
7740446	7740706	I know.
7740927	7741187	All right.
7741667	7742287	Hi, everyone.
7742348	7748191	I just finished listening to November's Internet Outrage-Ridden Podcast, and it's one time I thought I don't listen live.
7749312	7749592	Oh, yeah?
7749612	7750373	Well, I'm not going to read it.
7750593	7750893	No, sorry.
7751834	7752154	Okay.
7752814	7757876	Anyhow, being an avid Android gamer, I wanted to chime in with my suggestions for your Twitter topic poster.
7758576	7765359	All reviewed in 140 characters or less-ish so DarkSakura can read them without having kittens because that just makes Shermie feel inadequate.
7765579	7767380	Well, that's okay because Shermie can't have kittens anyway.
7767980	7768661	She's too old.
7768701	7769661	Her uterus fell out.
7770273	7771314	What's uterus talking about, Willis?
7785106	7788007	How many times can we say uterus in one radio show?
7788908	7789408	Angry Birds.
7789448	7792950	If someone stole my eggs, I'd go after them too, so have a fling and smash those pigs.
7794070	7794631	Asphalt 5.
7794671	7797772	3D racing with accelerator support for older models and a GT clone.

7799713	7800373	Asphalt HD.
7800433	7802754	Graphics update for higher-end devices and tablets.
7802854	7805336	Now with more cars, new tracks, repetitive stress, wrist injuries.
7806376	7806996	Battleheart.
7807537	7812159	Addicting dragon attack action with challenging battles and a variety of party and equipment options.
7812619	7813419	Not much of a story, though.
7813440	7814220	Shh.
7816153	7837592	Banzai Blast Japanese Zen-flavored Zuma clone with high replayability value for those 5-minute potty breaks where peace and calm are oh so important Dr. Stanley's House 1 and 2 point-and-click mystery game you misspelled mystery by the way
7838352	7840294	with a twist ending ported from a Flash game.
7840474	7844397	Duck Hunter, think SNES classic minus the dog with really funny foul play.
7844997	7845978	Ah, I see your pun.
7846818	7847759	Fruit Ninja, blah.
7847959	7850641	I mean, care for a fruit salad and have a minute to lose.
7850741	7852943	Flick at your screen and get as many fruits before the time runs out.
7852963	7853803	You'll have a blast.
7856345	7857706	You're still trying to make my cat talk?
7857826	7858727	I'm rubbing her belly.
7858827	7859387	She likes it.
7860308	7861068	Hexadictus.

7873857	7875138	Pumpkins vs. Monsters.
7875418	7877479	It's a clone of... You know what?
7877519	7878440	I'm not reading the rest of this.
7879701	7882643	Well, hopefully at least one of them sparked your listeners or your interest.
7882983	7884584	Listen to you next week, Dr. Noir.
7885045	7889237	Well, I wanted to hear more about pumpkin whatevers, but DarkSakura was like, no.
7889377	7890240	Smiley pops.
7893181	7900325	PS's email was written at 5am while waiting for a delayed flight back to Mexico at a Colombian airport with no coffee available.
7900625	7901525	I know, ironic, right?
7901885	7905647	After four straight 15-hour work days, so if I misspelled something, blame it on the exhaustion.
7906088	7907648	Okay, I forgive you this time.
7908909	7910990	And I might go post your list later.
7911490	7912811	I'll put it on the Tumblr eventually.
7914452	7916973	Xbox has followed in the footsteps of PSN Network.
7917733	7918734	That's redundant, isn't it?
7920097	7924861	PSN Network, that's like ATM card or PIN number Are you thinking ATM machine?
7925461	7945257	Yeah, ATM machine and PIN number I've linked an article, though I actually didn't hear about it from them My husband is in law school and he actually reads the terms of service before he agrees Anyway, the overall impression he gave me was this is a crappy backhanded move but as far as crappy backhanded moves go, it's not so bad
7945777	7956365	Essentially, while they block you from class action, they agree to pay all fees associated with arbitration and formally agree to pay $1,000 or what the arbitrator decides is fair, whichever is greater.
7957466	7962309	It's still crappy, though, and that's from Holly D. It's still crappy.
7962649	7964771	It's still crappy, but I agree, less crappy.
7965772	7967393	This is from Robobobobobobobo.
7968345	7972346	I sent the following email to my state's consumer protection division of the Attorney General's office.
7972406	7973646	I'll let you know what they reply.
7974167	7978888	I did discover that my mandatory arbitration can be disputed if you feel treated unfairly.
7979088	7984589	Oddly enough, it would take something extraordinary for me to want to sue a game system manufacturer.
7985390	7986110	And this is the email.
7987110	7990471	I give this guy massive props for actually doing something about it, though.
7992012	7999295	Lately, video game console manufacturers are updating their EULAs for operating their game systems with mandatory arbitration clauses.
7999836	8008380	Are there sources of information on what clauses are allowed in EULAs and what clauses are invalidated by Maryland law?
8008940	8017344	As for my own opinion, it seems wrong that an expensive electronics device can be rendered useless if you don't agree completely with the EULA.
8017404	8018465	Thanks for any response.
8020766	8022767	That's not how he signed it, but that's how I'm saying it.
8023707	8024907	I still want to see what reply.
8025767	8026027	Okay.
8026808	8028468	And that's it.
8029588	8029948	All right.
8030089	8031589	I mean, that's not it, of course, for emails.
8031609	8034090	We got a bajillion emails in the last few weeks.
8034150	8035830	It's been building up for like a month, keep in mind.
8035890	8036830	But I ain't reading anymore.
8036870	8042772	But if you would like to be considered for next week, we read them all at least, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8043492	8046913	And by the way, you have a better chance if your email is concise.
8048231	8055414	The PETA Tanuki suit thing is still topical.
8055454	8058236	I'll show you my thesis on this.
8058456	8062097	PETA is intentionally grabbing negative attention for donations.
8062117	8064078	It has nothing to do with what they are trying to protect.
8064418	8068480	How better to get attention by being negative publicity about a beloved icon?
8068900	8069801	PETA's logic is this.
8069881	8072525	An imaginary character wears an imaginary suit with special powers.
8073005	8077791	This tanuki suit resembles a tanuki fur, which a tanuki is a mythical creature, by the way.
8077851	8078833	It's just a raccoon dog.
8079862	8108881	so the imaginary prospect of killing an animal is bad slash evil so send money PETA is pretty famous for flinging fake blood on real furs to demonstrate the cruelty of the fur industry and equating fur with murder so their fake blood is that of a fake animal or worse of a fake human by their own logic they are advocating animal slash people slaughter I think Jamie said it best when she said a few weeks ago PETA is crazy of course that's why people love picking on Mickey Mouse too okay that's it alright mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
8109622	8116336	This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because it's our show and sometimes we have angst and we have to get it all out in a segment called the FUs of the Week.
8132589	8153455	A big F you goes to the increased militarization of national police forces and to there not being enough change in the way people vote to where we still have assholes in office and also to assholes running for office who like to wear the same jacket from Brobeck Mountain.
8155416	8155616	Loki.
8157213	8179535	Fuck you to my radio in my car because apparently the track skip forward button is starting to break and so sometimes it thinks, or actually most of the time now, it thinks I'm hitting track backwards and then sometimes it thinks I'm also changing the mode of my player to play the radio or something like that.
8180176	8182901	or sometimes it will actually work and go forward.
8183081	8188913	So that fucking sucks because now it's making it very difficult to pick the song I want to listen to.
8190993	8195116	Alright, my FU, first one goes to Rick Perry, because he's such an assbag.
8195397	8196417	And I have a right to say that.
8196658	8198279	I believe that Rick Perry is an assbag.
8199200	8199620	You know what?
8199920	8205084	I imagine when you said assbag, that he was actually the bag that attaches to a colostomy.
8205544	8206525	That's pretty much what he is.
8207666	8213090	Just disgusting and gross and insulting the way he's pandering to people.
8213251	8213971	It's just insulting.
8214371	8218014	So, just, I don't... Barf, barfy barfs.
8218194	8219916	Did you see the thing that Santorin said?
8221426	8222386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8240531	8262997	and that's a good compliment but some of them need to learn such humility so anyway without getting too political but my other FU I will say that's a little sillier is FU to the fact that in looking for raid in World of Warcraft that only one piece of gear has dropped for me
8264520	8265320	Can I add to that too?
8265500	8265720	What?
8266001	8267421	F you to that pug last night.
8267501	8271903	You need to do what I do and start writing down their names and servers and reading it on Horde House.
8272443	8273183	John wrote them all down.
8273403	8273743	Oh, did he?
8273943	8275024	Yeah, we were going to email you.
8275404	8275864	Oh, you should.
8275984	8276444	You should do that.
8276744	8277765	They were all from the same server.
8278005	8278285	Alright.
8278705	8279225	Dick faces.
8280566	8282026	Alright, there you go.
8282106	8283607	That's it for the FUs of the week.
8284420	8285822	Just a few more news stories for you guys.
8285863	8291472	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8291572	8293275	Add us on Skype if you haven't already.
8293615	8294497	But we'll get to that in a minute.
8294537	8295398	First, more stories.
8295438	8295619	Loki.
8296072	8297453	Yes, this is kind of neat.
8298013	8303275	OnLive is finally coming to the iOS platform as well as Android.
8303976	8305596	And it's really neat.
8305616	8311099	You can actually use it to play games on your tablet or phone device.
8311999	8324245	They also are going to be selling a wireless controller that comes with the free app download as well for about, I want to say, $50, which also is the same price as a streaming console if you really want to.
8325106	8339386	And it is Bluetooth and allows you to basically use your tablet as a screen instead of having to use the on-screen touch-sensitive buttons and stuff that they have, which they have that option if you don't want to do that.
8341309	8347594	And apparently also some of the games that they're actually converting over to work with the touch controls on these tablets.
8347614	8348675	Like, for example, L.A.
8348715	8357843	Noire was something that Rockstar Games is actually going back and fixing that up so that you can use touch controls with the game as well.
8358623	8366930	And I want to say there was Kingdom of Keflings that was also going to be getting kind of the same treatment as well.
8370024	8372385	It just looks kind of neat, and I guess it works pretty well.
8374146	8376928	I actually thought about downloading this to try it.
8376948	8382371	I don't know if I have to actually purchase the app to check it out, but obviously you need an online subscription and stuff.
8382431	8384352	But it'd be neat to check out.
8384832	8392916	I would not want to play on my iPod, though, with the screen controls, because I can imagine my hand would cover the whole damn thing.
8394197	8395778	But it's still kind of neat that they could do this.
8396158	8398979	You know what would be really cool, I guess?
8399200	8406623	I don't know if it has the power to do that, but the Apple TV, if you could do an app like that.
8406703	8415467	But with the rumors around the corner that Apple is actually creating their own TV set soon, this very well could be integrated into something like that.
8415487	8417348	That's one way to get more Apple TVs sold.
8417408	8418989	I'm talking about the actual set-top boxes.
8419029	8420670	Just build it into an actual TV.
8420850	8422231	Yeah.
8422831	8424692	Make them in cool colors and everybody will want one.
8426192	8429516	It's an interesting prospect.
8429856	8431378	It works pretty good.
8432520	8442871	Of course, the only downside is obviously it's not going to work as good as your streaming console because those are normally wired connections versus this.
8443232	8445695	You probably want to be on Wi-Fi to be able to...
8446175	8449237	Play the games, you know, full resolution without any lag.
8450118	8453580	Although, from what I was reading, like, you know, games are normally 60 frames per second.
8453620	8455542	It was 50 frames per second.
8455802	8460305	And, you know, maybe the resolution's a little lower than it would normally be.
8460385	8462046	But overall, not too bad.
8462066	8468771	I actually saw some gameplay footage of someone playing Saints Row the Third on an iPod or something like that.
8469051	8469371	Wow.
8469572	8470792	So that was kind of cool looking.
8470812	8471313	Yeah.
8471854	8473136	Saints Row 3rd on the go.
8474098	8474800	That is tempting.
8475020	8478849	But, yeah, I don't know.
8479170	8480533	It's a really neat idea.
8480713	8482216	So it will be interesting to see.
8483269	8484309	What games are supported right now?
8484329	8492132	They don't have all of the games obviously supporting this, but they're launching with about 18 games.
8493893	8499395	I guess they launched originally with 21 games when the streaming console came out.
8500215	8508418	They're going to be adding more as they convert some over and get them to work a little bit better with the portable systems.
8509224	8511266	Alright, very interesting the way this technology is going.
8511306	8520633	I think this could be pretty huge in the future because even if it's not on live itself, people are going to see what on live is doing and think hmm, how can we do that for our gaming experience?
8521253	8524396	It's just a matter of time before developers just cut out on live completely.
8525096	8541591	I mean especially on something like iOS why the only thing you need on live for is their bandwidth and maybe I don't think the technology is particularly proprietary because there are competitors like there was that whole FIFA streaming to YouTube thing that was Genkai or whatever so it's going to be interesting to see what happens
8542492	8544594	Anyhow, I want to move on to another story.
8544674	8546957	This had the game world talking this week.
8546997	8553223	This was huge news this week because Wired had an interview with Miyamoto and they ran the headline.
8553243	8558228	This is the headline, quote, Nintendo's Miyamoto stepping down working on smaller games.
8558629	8559770	And everybody took that and said,
8559870	8561853	Literally, this is around the rest of the internet.
8562193	8563555	Miyamoto's quitting Nintendo.
8564156	8570724	Miyamoto is retiring because people read into that saying Miyamoto's stepping down and they kind of miss the hidden subtext.
8570884	8576091	And granted, this headline is a little bit sensationalistic, but that's the way headlines are kind of written to be.
8577132	8581917	is that Miyamoto's stepping down from the Mario and Zelda games that he's been working on.
8582478	8591208	And of course, Nintendo followed this up with an official quote where Nintendo is basically like, no, no, no, Miyamoto is not retiring.
8591968	8611944	video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto's role at Nintendo is not changing he will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts in discussing his priorities at Nintendo in a media interview Mr. Miyamoto explained how he is encouraging the younger developers of the company to take more initiative and responsibility for developing software and in fact if you kind of go back to the original interview here's what the Wired article says
8612885	8613145	Quote,
8642268	8649311	When all is said and done, the internet was making this out to sound like bad news, I think this is great news.
8649711	8650952	I think this is fantastic news.
8651492	8658595	I don't think Miyamoto should be taking all this time to work on Zelda and Mario games when the outlines are pretty much all laid out.
8658715	8663217	I mean, I think he should be there to give creative input and so forth, but that's really it.
8663698	8666439	I mean, these things are in kind of capable hands now.
8666519	8668380	You know, Miyamoto ain't getting any younger.
8668920	8692408	he's been making games since the original NES which just celebrated his 25th anniversary so I would like to see before he really does have to retire I mean all good things must come to an end folks someday Miyamoto's gonna die so I hope it's not for a long time I'm not saying anything rude yeah I'm just saying and inevitably someday Orange Lounge Radio will end
8693911	8695473	It has to end at some point.
8695854	8697135	I'm not saying it's going to end this week.
8697876	8700019	And we're going to try to go as long as we possibly can.
8700359	8703043	Someday, Grandma will grab Pogo to die.
8704284	8711133	But my point is, you know, maybe Miyamoto's like, do I really want to spend the rest of my years in Nintendo working on another Zelda game?
8712114	8713215	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8734383	8739146	But what if in that brain of his is the next Mario or the next Zelda?
8739686	8742387	I mean, aren't you all complaining at the same token?
8742407	8744989	I'm kind of sick of Nintendo putting out the same shit over and over again.
8745329	8747490	Then let Miyamoto develop something else.
8747870	8749631	This is fantastic news.
8752092	8754814	You get limited when you're stuck with the same thing over and over again.
8754834	8756895	It's the same reason why actors don't want to be typecast.
8758001	8758401	Don't you think?
8759242	8759483	Yes.
8760063	8760444	Same thing.
8761465	8764268	And of course, now the chat room is running with this, Actdeft.
8764568	8765790	Miyamoto will never die.
8765850	8767472	Don't say such cruel things, Rob.
8767852	8768613	Alpha Cananogram.
8768653	8770455	Miyamoto die, kill the non-believer.
8770715	8771516	Well, I will say this.
8772237	8772778	I will say this.
8772798	8773859	This is a high compliment.
8775640	8779462	When the inevitable happens and Miyamoto passes away, think of it this way.
8780042	8785904	The work that he's created in some ways kind of defines this generation.
8786105	8787985	It defines a part of our culture.
8788706	8793868	And some of us could only be so lucky to have really made that kind of impact on the world.
8794268	8797089	I mean, Miyamoto made an impact on the world.
8797589	8800991	So in that sense, Miyamoto is immortal in that sense.
8801971	8802691	Right, DarkSakura?
8827932	8829153	Yeah, I've been listening to you at all, have you?
8829193	8833176	Yeah, no, I was, but I actually just had a brush with celebrity moment.
8833597	8833697	Oh?
8835018	8840342	One of my favorite people ever who's been on a reality show, and I'm not a big reality show person, but I love MasterChef.
8841563	8850951	Ben Starr, the guy who has like fourth place on the season before last, just said that he thought that my dish sounded delicious.
8850971	8851952	Wow.
8851972	8853974	I asked him for advice on cooking a butternut squash.
8854574	8854714	Wow.
8855655	8857597	Just because I was like, I'll ask a pro, why not?
8858398	8862742	And he seems to reply to people, but he gave me his method, but he gave it to me like 20 hours late.
8863422	8864944	So he's like, so what did you end up doing with it?
8864964	8868928	And I said, oh, I cooked it and it was still firm, so I saved it to microwave.
8869448	8872871	And I said, I mixed this, that, and the other, and he said, that sounds really yummy.
8873512	8875474	So I was like, I got a compliment.
8876621	8877602	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8894365	8895026	Let me put it this way.
8895066	8898227	When I followed George Takei on Twitter, he sent me a direct message.
8898848	8900469	It's like, thanks for following me and all that stuff.
8900509	8901369	I know he didn't write it.
8901429	8903390	I know he's got people that probably do that stuff.
8903410	8904691	He's not sitting there at his computer all day.
8904711	8905612	He's got better things to do.
8906472	8909654	And probably a lot of that stuff he posts to Facebook too.
8910394	8914337	Some of it might get his approval, but he probably has a whole team of people that maintain his public image.
8914357	8916278	And I'll tell you this, they do a damn fucking good job
8916878	8916998	Mm-hmm.
8917058	8917198	Mm-hmm.
8939111	8946235	Yeah, I said that I love my family, but I wish that I had been adopted by George Takei and Julie Andrews.
8947436	8951338	Or if they were really my parents, then I would be half Japanese with an amazing singing voice.
8953619	8954740	And probably a raging lesbian.
8955420	8955680	All right.
8956220	8956841	Let's move on.
8956901	8958222	Just a few more news stories for you guys.
8958242	8958722	Dark Sakura.
8959431	8960592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8984110	8985771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9005248	9006029	Yeah, oh no.
9006089	9013235	Well, that at least makes the delay between versions a little more worth the wait if they've managed to tweak it to look even better.
9013275	9018820	I mean, granted, you probably need the highest of high-end systems to be able to really see, but it's still pretty cool.
9018881	9026547	But see, they're showing it versus the PS3 and the PC, some of the difference in the shading effect and the textures.
9026568	9027028	Yeah.
9027588	9039999	It actually, and I have to say, because we have the PS3 one here, as clean as it was, I mean, it's really hard to compare a console with a PC.
9040480	9045484	When the PCs are consistently upgradable, you know, you can get the best stuff for it.
9046185	9046465	Yeah.
9047746	9057913	But as beautiful as the textures and the lighting and everything in the PC one was, it actually really makes me appreciate the PS3 version.
9058654	9060235	Because it really is pretty close.
9060836	9065859	Even though, I mean, yeah, tech spec wise, the PC one will blow it out of the water.
9066680	9070022	But the PS3 version really keeps up.
9071503	9072244	It's a gorgeous game.
9072604	9073325	Absolutely gorgeous game.
9073365	9073945	One of the year's best.
9074491	9077652	But there are also some other improvements too, just in the PC one.
9078252	9087454	Other than the higher resolution textures, they actually, it's all the stuff that you see up close, like pores and indentations under the skin.
9087474	9088275	You can see veins.
9090115	9092896	They really put a lot of effort into making it look realistic.
9094316	9095157	I want to go back to chat.
9095497	9100079	The chat room's a little bit delayed, but there was a great quote here from chat on the Miyamoto thing.
9100099	9104742	I want to read this real quick here from Midori in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com I love your drinks.
9106403	9117269	He, meaning Miyamoto, will be immortal, but I understand that if I had the choice, I'd want to be known for making the most favored characters over how many games I could develop for a few loved characters.
9118069	9122752	That's a really good way to sum it up, so I just wanted to throw that out there, because that mirrors my thoughts very closely.
9123172	9126633	All right, just a couple quick stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is going to open up.
9126753	9127193	So, Loki.
9128433	9129634	All right.
9130194	9132854	So this is neat, I guess.
9133534	9141436	They're going to be giving a little bit of bonuses for fans of Final Fantasy XIII too, or even the original Final Fantasy game.
9141656	9148958	If you play the original Final Fantasy XIII game and you have a game save, you're going to be getting some special features, including special monster decorations and
9149378	9151320	and a higher success rate at the games.
9151620	9152821	I guess they have a gambling area.
9152841	9159027	I wonder if it's anything like, what was that in Final Fantasy VII, like the Golden something or other, I can't remember what it was called.
9159107	9162871	Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
9163992	9169517	Also, I guess they're saying that the game's going to be broken up into episodes and each episode will be about three hours long.
9170177	9174902	Also going to be adding an auto-save system as well as the ability to save it at different places.
9175642	9199966	plus there's going to be a new game plus mode that adds I guess unlockable items and also new monster decorations as well and neat I mean that extra stuff is good I know that they're going to be doing some DLC though for it and I think that's kind of ridiculous as far as what they're adding with the DLC I think more monster decorations but remember it's optional you don't need to buy it
9201107	9207210	Well, that's good as long as it's extra frilly stuff and not necessary to the game's completion.
9208010	9208150	Yeah.
9208270	9209451	But the game's sounding better and better.
9209491	9210091	I can't wait to play it.
9210131	9213433	I really need to actually finish the last chapter of Final Fantasy XIII.
9213453	9217915	You know, I was digging through my bag the other day and I saw Final Fantasy XIII there.
9217935	9218135	I'm like...
9218975	9220837	Oh yeah, I need to finish that.
9221137	9223900	By the way, chat room to the rescue on the gambling thing in Final Fantasy 7.
9223960	9224640	Gold saucer.
9225021	9226102	Yeah, it is gold something.
9227403	9232548	Alright, and one more Final Fantasy related story for you guys this week and it has to do with Final Fantasy 14.
9233929	9234530	Guess what?
9234650	9238553	They are going to charge service fees for Final Fantasy 14.
9239474	9240775	Wah, wah, wah.
9241036	9241656	I'm not playing.
9242737	9245799	Final Fantasy XIV, here's the deal.
9246000	9249983	They will be implementing the fee change on January 6th.
9250463	9251744	This has been pushed back a little bit.
9251764	9254266	It was supposed to start by now, essentially.
9254626	9258209	So on January 6th, they are going to start the new pricing structure.
9258929	9264494	So what will happen is that the subscription fees, this is weird, the basic service is $6.99 for 30 days.
9268176	9296938	and then the real subscription fee when the new version starts will be $9.99 for 30 days it's kind of weird the way that's set up but there you go and if you want extra characters that's the other weird thing it's $3 a character it's definitely cheaper than $14.95 but still I mean that monthly fee it's going to be very interesting to see the impact that has on the game I think it's going to kill it I think it has us die hard fans that still support it but now that they're going to ask money out of pocket every month that's going to be rough I know I won't pay for it
9297378	9299522	I'll go back and check it out when version 2 launches.
9301304	9303428	Or if there's some huge content upgrade.
9304409	9305831	I think Zether summed it up in chat.
9305912	9308275	Well, there goes Final Fantasy 14.
9309577	9310018	Bye-bye.
9310679	9311240	Nice knowing you.
9313257	9319862	Let's go to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9320183	9322284	I'm going to check the Twitter too to see if we have any tweets.
9322364	9333113	I forgot to ask for those earlier because I was so involved in the Mario Kart thing earlier but I'll look for those if I can find them amongst the new Twitter because they've changed the look of Twitter again.
9334874	9335075	Why?
9335135	9335675	Because they can.
9335755	9337577	Although I will say it's not terrible.
9339278	9341320	Alright, let's go to the Skype line.
9342355	9345879	Meanwhile, while we wait for the Skype line, Loki, do we have last minute stories?
9345919	9349103	I'm sure there's got to be a few tonight because I think there were some big things I skipped over, right?
9351045	9351325	Maybe.
9352727	9353548	I didn't look them up.
9355470	9359474	I'm trying to think here if there's anything really major that I could think of off the top of my head.
9359595	9360896	I have a couple tweets while you're looking.
9362157	9371161	Mishiru-chan says, I just picked up the Oregon Trail game for the Wii and it's pretty fun.
9371662	9374003	I'm working on doing a write-up to post on site.
9374623	9374943	Awesome.
9375023	9376164	I would like to hear more about it.
9376224	9378165	I hope it's better than the Facebook one, that's for sure.
9378425	9383508	I think it looks very similar to the Facebook and the phone version that they had out.
9384128	9387890	In fact, I would be surprised if it wasn't the exact same.
9388230	9389971	I hope it will not die of dysentery.
9391411	9396634	YYR tweets us saying, remember, boom, and sends us a YouTube link.
9396714	9404398	Usually I don't play YouTube links on the show, but I'm hoping that it's a link from BungieFerretCat.
9405478	9407079	Oh no, this is from Magic Knight Rayearth.
9410352	9411212	and Precious.
9412553	9414834	Mysterious Sephiroth lecture number three.
9416195	9419557	You've just mastered the skill known as the Pulverizing Bash.
9421118	9426680	Indeed, by running to increase your speed, the power to throw yourselves increases as well.
9427941	9432984	You can destroy places with weak foundations or small cracks with incredible ease.
9434858	9438663	Be sure to give yourself plenty of room to run so you can increase your speed.
9439994	9440494	That's right!
9441255	9444557	Make a good approach, start running, and then... Boom!
9445898	9446659	That's all for today!
9465948	9495102	um oh yesterday I recently beat um well yesterday I beat um Snatcher yesterday it was really fun oh I freaking love Snatcher gosh that's old school nice yeah it's I I would I didn't think I would be able to finish it like to finish all of it but I finished like the second by the time you finish the second act the game pretty much becomes like pretty much just go like goes automatically for you but there is this one final shooting segment that's actually very difficult um
9497079	9524294	it was the super insector things and they start like swarming around the screen and then I kept dying repeatedly at that part and then it came up to the I didn't realize that there was a second part where you had to shoot snatchers and I died during that and it kicks you back to the first part again with the insectors so it's a little annoying having to keep doing it over and over but I beat it, it was pretty good
9525413	9527975	It's always a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a game.
9528295	9532297	It's one I haven't felt in a long time because I have such gamer ADD I never finish anything.
9532978	9539161	Yeah, I actually did finish Saints Row the Third a month ago, I think.
9539382	9540902	Now what did you think of Saints Row the Third?
9541163	9543204	Because I just played it for the first time this week.
9544093	9545554	I think it was really good.
9545654	9548435	It was pretty over-the-top insane.
9548695	9554318	I pre-ordered it on Steam full price, and I definitely got what I paid for.
9554439	9555459	It was really good.
9555779	9556940	Nice.
9557500	9558841	I love how over-the-top it is.
9559321	9565044	Did you try to make a character who was kind of like you, or did you make a character who was over-the-top too?
9565244	9567405	I actually downloaded a character from the...
9568906	9597143	from like the online thing they had a guy who looked like Gabe Newell so I used him for the whole game nice and it was hilarious just seeing this guy running who looks like Gabe Newell running around like being all snarky and blowing stuff up it's like oh wow Gabe Newell is blowing up a helicopter now he's killing these furries in this game show that sounds like something Gabe Newell might actually do
9597975	9600617	Yeah, it was pretty good.
9601677	9602017	Awesome.
9602037	9604019	Well, it sounds like I've barely scratched the surface of the game.
9604059	9604959	Furries on a game show?
9604999	9607761	I haven't come across this yet, so it sounds pretty awesome.
9607801	9609081	Yeah, it's one of the side missions.
9609282	9613604	You play in Genki's little ridiculous game show thing.
9613924	9616426	I keep doing the missions, like, one after another.
9616466	9619347	Should I just say, screw it, and kind of drive around and look for stuff?
9619367	9621428	No, because they're going to take you through all the, like...
9622549	9636346	Diversions basically by actually playing the missions because it goes through the whole tutorial mode a little long but it's good because you've never played any of the games so you don't know how to play insurance fraud or anything like that.
9637468	9639591	But they'll take you through the Genki show and
9640931	9664200	Tiger Escort and stuff like that oh yeah that one's good the tank one is the best I think the tank one where you have to rack up the most money and damage is the best because you can literally just keep pressing forward holding down both fire buttons for the minigun and the main cannon you can pretty much just keep racking up the points it's all about the fences
9664920	9672567	My favorite thing so far has been the little computer that my chick picked up and she can use it to just fire guided missiles at tanks.
9673067	9674909	Oh yeah, that's awesome.
9675489	9679212	It's kind of like a missile launch.
9679252	9680573	Yeah, the missile drop thing.
9680593	9682535	Yeah, it's like a little computer you use to launch missiles.
9682575	9686878	I guess it's like a regular weapon you can use to just launch guided missiles at your foes.
9687059	9688039	That's pretty impressive.
9688920	9696941	and I gotta say the environments like I love the whole like downtown LA looking environment it's very neon and I love purple so I'm glad it's the gang's color
9697635	9699917	Just wait until you get to the Tron world.
9699937	9701559	The Tron world is amazing.
9701779	9703781	I'm sure I'll have a huge boner over the Tron world.
9703921	9706223	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
9706323	9708485	I was enjoying every minute of it.
9708725	9709026	Awesome.
9709826	9710067	Awesome.
9710347	9713490	All right, well, Zether, any other final thoughts to get out there before we let you go?
9714070	9714711	Not much.
9714871	9719976	I finished Snatcher and I'm actually playing the MSX version because somebody translated it.
9720116	9720897	Old school Snatcher.
9721448	9723649	Yeah, even older than the Sega CD-1.
9723849	9729732	And then I'm probably going to go play Policenauts, which is the follow-up of sorts.
9729752	9731973	You're just having a Kojima Fest over there.
9732193	9734114	I have Policenauts on PlayStation.
9734374	9735335	Check out the original Metal Gear.
9735355	9737476	Yeah, that's the one that got translated, actually.
9737976	9740137	And the real Metal Gear 2 that's on MSX.
9740157	9744439	Well, no, I mean, I've got it in Japanese, and it was a pain in the butt trying to play through in Japanese.
9745211	9745911	Oh yeah, it is.
9746752	9747692	Lots of text.
9748052	9750053	Alright, well, Zether, enjoy your Kajima-thon, okay?
9750613	9750973	Alright.
9750993	9751433	Alright, later.
9752193	9753274	Later.
9753554	9756095	1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9756135	9758936	AkumaJP in chat says, human rights for furries, too.
9759276	9759976	Well, you know what?
9760056	9764398	If I'm not mistaken, you could make your character a furry, and you could just revenge the furries.
9764858	9768579	So if you want to blow everything up as a furry, you have every right to do so.
9768699	9774221	And you could lead this notorious gang of criminals, if you want, that everybody stops and asks for the autograph.
9774881	9781567	So like, I just remember in the very beginning of the game, some girl asked for some guy's autograph and then I walked up and she didn't want my autograph so I shot her.
9781727	9783349	I was like, how rude, bang.
9785711	9788413	Game makes me sound like a terrible person, but it's really fun.
9788473	9789854	That's because you are a terrible person.
9789954	9790255	Hey!
9792717	9793537	I'll shoot you too.
9793558	9795439	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9796340	9796660	Alright.
9797861	9800884	More last minute stories-ish things going on over there?
9801144	9805367	Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD
9831198	9831899	Legend of Zaku here.
9831919	9832879	Zaku, what's up?
9834120	9840325	Nothing much, just kicking back, making sure I stay calm and sane before tomorrow's work week.
9841226	9842827	Well, good luck.
9843587	9844928	It's been a while since I called.
9845389	9845949	It's been a little while.
9845969	9847230	What have you been playing?
9847250	9847630	What's new?
9848831	9855576	Let's see, Forza 4, having to tackle the wireless steering wheel that Microsoft released for the 360.
9857798	9859359	But all in all, it's been like...
9860862	9865567	I've been mostly that and just playing my PC, but nothing new on that end.
9865848	9867730	Do you use head tracking in Forza 4 at all?
9867750	9868311	Do you have Kinect?
9868331	9869332	I don't have a Kinect.
9869372	9871254	I don't have enough space in my room for a Kinect.
9871394	9876200	You could get one of those little Zoom things, but I kind of bought one and it kind of sucks for me.
9876980	9877441	I didn't like it.
9877461	9880444	It's smaller than the dorm rooms I was in, you know, in college.
9880625	9881706	Well, you do live in New York City.
9882662	9883783	Yeah, but it's a house.
9885284	9897895	Anyways, like I noticed yesterday, I know it's almost like gaming related, but one of the best DDR freestylers in the country, you know, frequency.
9899577	9900458	I know him in real life.
9901138	9905962	He had his little going away party yesterday and pretty much all the old school DDR players came out.
9906043	9906763	Where's he going to?
9908044	9909085	Moving back to Long Island.
9909105	9909846	Oh, okay.
9911112	9914233	So yeah, that was pretty much me just getting drunk.
9914873	9920854	I think I should have gotten a DDR dollar bill into the mix, but I didn't even notify him.
9926056	9934438	But anyways, shifting on real quick, video game awards were yesterday, and I noticed that Battlefield 3 got shafted.
9935319	9936300	Thank you for watching!
9960695	9986775	it's it's well without getting into the whole modern warfare versus battlefield thing because honestly I have no authority whatsoever to speak on that subject but it I just in general it's a it's a tough year for for for game awards and all that because there's so much good shit this year it has really been a great year for games as it should be I mean the systems have been out how long you know this is the years where they're really perfecting these systems I expect next year should kick a lot of ass too
9988024	9989365	I mean, yeah, you're right.
9989405	9992846	I mean, Mass Effect 3 is like, what, a month away from now?
9993107	9993427	That's right.
9993447	9995368	Yeah, those games aren't afraid to release in January.
9996888	9997489	Yeah, of course.
9997529	10002751	I mean, they have very little competition for movies since that's a dumping ground for those films anyways.
10004372	10005593	Yeah, it's a smart time to release a game.
10006693	10014697	Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that yeah, this was a pretty good year for video gaming in recent memory.
10015377	10016458	Oh yeah, pretty much so.
10017179	10027408	And hopefully next year, whatever they release, whatever they come out with, at that point they're going to start, you know, I'm more concerned about Nintendo.
10028409	10032393	Like, they better start pulling rabbits out of their hat to replace their aging Wii.
10032773	10033854	Well, Wii U next year.
10034715	10042562	Yeah, they can pull it off if the rumors aren't true that their dev units are even, are just like, not even up to par yet.
10043001	10050727	Well, keep in mind, too, 3DS, thanks to the two strong releases, has gained a lot of steam, which I think we all saw coming.
10050747	10056472	We knew they had to pull it out this holiday season, and I think they've succeeded to an extent with the two big releases.
10056552	10063578	I don't know what the final word is on how much it's sold, but I think they're saying already it's sold more than the DS did in its first year.
10063638	10071464	Now, granted, it's a little bit apple to oranges because the 3DS should have the DS's inertia to piggyback on, but...
10073006	10077192	I think, all in all, the 3DS is not going away anytime soon.
10077965	10085811	Right, and then obviously it still has to contend with the Vita and then all the new powerful smartphones that are coming out within the next year.
10085871	10088733	I kind of think there's room for both the 3DS and the Vita.
10088853	10091835	I don't think they're going to bite from each other that much.
10092176	10095718	What about the third one, the mobile game market?
10096519	10102203	The fact that the smartphones out there are pretty much not only matching but exceeding their specs.
10104261	10110106	I don't know I wonder if Angry Birds would count since they already have it on PSP
10121854	10148183	I'm not big on Angry Birds it's not to say mobile phone games are bad because there's a lot of good ones out there but most mobile phone games are kind of developed for mobile phones and they kind of like the handheld game and mobile phones are kind of two separate worlds for me but I get how the two can cannibalize from each other as well I get how mobile phone is kicking Nintendo in the pants a little bit because Angry Birds is 99 cents and Mario Kart's 40
10150566	10155471	I mean, alright, on one hand, you have like a system that's basically... You're right, it's touchscreen.
10155511	10158914	It's not the best thing for hardcore gamers.
10158954	10165520	But at the end of the day, they have, you know, the platforms that they're running on, not only iPhone and Android, they're just like...
10167330	10178493	They're getting out these systems for about the same price, but it's something that you're going to carry with every day and going to use in an emergency, in addition to just playing Angry Birds or any other hot game right now.
10178693	10186755	Even me, for example, I bought SimCity for $0.10 today from the Android market where they had that little sale.
10187155	10189956	I'm kicking myself because I missed out on Minecraft earlier last week.
10191983	10194526	Mirror's Edge was free on iOS this weekend, by the way.
10195547	10196528	I don't know if it still is.
10196809	10200994	I grabbed it when it was, so yay me.
10201755	10204117	There are certain games I would play on the Android market.
10204137	10209103	It's just a matter of the ones that I'm willing to shell out money for.
10210436	10215900	Those are pretty much rare, aside from Angry Birds and TapTap.
10216261	10233994	If they had something like SimCity or maybe a strategy game where you move around units, not like a castle defense game, but something like a StarCraft or a Command & Conquer clone, then I could definitely see myself playing that on the subways.
10234585	10235866	Hey, I work really hard all the time.
10258360	10285878	Excuse me Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Quickly with these last few tweets Loki left the room for a minute but we'll get him to do the last few last minute stories TigerClaw wanted to send us a link that talks about layoffs at THQ's UDraw division Yep, it looks like some layoffs have happened over there 30 employees were laid off on Friday and layoffs are never good news but at the same time
10286438	10287118	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10310328	10316192	And they actually mentioned, she actually said, Oh, we just bought last Christmas' U-Draw tablet, but we never play it.
10317653	10322996	So it's kind of one of those, you know, oops, the inertia wasn't strong enough to keep the U-Draw thing going.
10323096	10324677	Sounds like.
10325197	10326438	Yep, so there it went.
10326738	10327139	Goodbye.
10328259	10336865	And from Ranma tweets us, On the hooves of the popular cartoon, we have My Little Pony, Fighting is Magic.
10338100	10338900	My Little Pony Fighting Game
10365273	10366113	All right, one more tweet.
10366153	10368074	I'm going to sneak in one more tweet here from Ziba.
10369054	10373395	I like Ziba, and she's psychic because she knew it from my teaser tweets.
10373555	10374955	She knew about the whole umlaut thing.
10374975	10375576	She guessed it.
10376236	10380037	Ziba says, OLR, I recently downloaded Snoopy Street Fair on the App Store.
10380157	10380797	It's really fun.
10381177	10383337	If you are a Snoopy or Peanuts fan, get it.
10383457	10384078	I like Snoopy.
10384958	10387258	I wonder if it's like an action-y game or a puzzle game.
10387318	10388819	I'll have to find out more about it.
10389819	10390239	So there you go.
10390259	10391539	That's going to do it for tweets tonight.
10391579	10393380	Let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.
10393440	10393660	Loki.
10397160	10401424	Q Entertainment has revealed 99 Nights Online This is a 2D action MMO
10423024	10427467	It's interesting that this game refuses to go anywhere, yet we have such a hard time getting Xenoblade over here.
10427527	10427967	Just saying.
10428187	10436033	It looks very much like a lot of the 2D games that come over from Vanillaware and stuff like that.
10436973	10437734	Neat, I guess.
10438254	10440576	I don't know if that's actually coming out over here, though.
10440616	10443858	I think it's only in Japan, but pretty cool.
10444398	10451983	And then, I mean, this is just annoying, but apparently there's been a quote from
10454265	10468352	Capcom, Christian Svensson, who is the Vice President of Strategic Planning and Marketing Development, of course, commenting on Mega Man Legends 3, saying that, you know,
10470444	10472965	What was the actual quote here?
10473865	10478686	That Mega Man is still a key brand for them.
10479046	10488729	And that, you know, I guess basically promising that their fans that there will be a Mega Man game possibly coming out.
10490549	10492330	They're considering Mega Man's future.
10494190	10497371	How nice of you to give it some thought.
10497391	10499332	To take pittance on us commoners.
10499992	10501873	To allow us an audience with the king.
10502373	10506034	We're considering it, even though there's this big fan campaign to get another game.
10506274	10509535	We're considering, you know, being nice.
10509855	10511656	How bad do you want it, boys?
10513757	10521339	Seriously, and with that, as much as Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome, I can't support that kind of thing, so I don't know if I'd buy it.
10523857	10525740	I don't know.
10525980	10529325	It's a shame how that has all been ruined.
10530689	10536150	Now, I'm sure you're aware of Just Dance and how it's a popular franchise.
10536551	10543132	A lot of these smaller developers out there like to knock off this game and put out their own dancing game.
10543953	10555516	So, one of these companies, Oxygen Games, I believe, or OG International, which sounds a little bit funnier, they have a game called Get Up and Dance.
10555996	10556116	And
10557037	10571897	it's really hilarious actually I gotta show you I forgot to pull up the the other screenshot but basically the game looks almost exactly I mean straight down to the art style like Just Dance 3 but
10572097	10583763	Anyways, there was this court case from Ubisoft suing the company saying that you guys can't release this because this is violating copyright.
10585063	10588745	Basically, you're just creating a game that's exactly the same as ours.
10589185	10592947	Wait, did you say the game is called Get Up and Dance?
10593468	10594108	Get Up and Dance.
10594168	10595809	Because there's a total Bomani joke in there.
10595849	10596289	Did you get it?
10598250	10598390	Yes.
10604946	10618896	Anyway, so the court, though, has allowed, because Ubisoft, one of the things they wanted to do was put a temporary restraining order on the publisher to not be able to put this game out.
10619377	10621598	So they have been denied.
10622019	10625681	Ubisoft cannot restrain the release of this game.
10626162	10629764	It's supposed to be published in North America on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
10630605	10633027	Of course, you know, PlayStation 3 being the Moved version.
10633527	10659277	but yes the game looks exactly I mean straight down the artwork exactly like Just Dance of course will not sell as well as Just Dance alright that's it for last minute stories alright there's at least three people who get the joke I can count at least three people in chat who should understand that joke at least alright
10660802	10664603	Anyhow, that's going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
10665844	10666184	Aww.
10666284	10667364	Sad face.

10682988	10683988	We really appreciate it.
10684949	10687429	Now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
10687870	10689010	DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.
10689030	10689550	Your final thought.
10690397	10696321	Um, I really have an obsession with fab.com lately, but I can't afford anything there except for my Helveta cards.
10698042	10704546	My final thought is, um, I want at least one piece of tier 13 looking for raid by this time next week.
10705927	10707027	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10707347	10711650	My final thought is I've been looking for some good cage match songs and I found one.
10712691	10713031	All right.
10713735	10714376	That's going to do it.
10714436	10716157	Thank you guys once again for listening to our show.
10716217	10718579	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
10719019	10721921	Have a wonderful night, everybody, and thanks for listening.
10722082	10722462	Take care.
10739435	10741396	or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
10741416	10741836	See you next week!
