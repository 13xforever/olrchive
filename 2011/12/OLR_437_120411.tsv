15856	19002	A fan-demanded Wii game is finally set for release in the US.
19403	21488	Valve trolls everyone with a new t-shirt.
21788	24434	And the Comedy Central show is set to get a new video game.
31721	36886	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37106	38748	Orange Lounge Radio.
38808	49518	We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
49918	50559	It is December 4th, 2011.
50619	51500	It's the 437th episode of our show.
55163	55724	Wee Wee Wee Wee Wee
73961	83648	Anyway, also say hello to, hopefully feeling a little less like an animal, making animal noises all night tonight Say hello to Loki No, I'm not going to make animal noises all night Thank gosh, alright, how are you doing, Loki?
84189	97999	Fine Yeah, alright, good Actually, I don't know about you guys, I am doing very, very well I got great news, literally, two minutes, literally, two minutes before we went live tonight Like, after the call with Bobby on his show, before our show went live
99040	100441	Our website is coming back.
101022	102383	Yay.
102423	103024	Yay.
103044	104305	Yay.
104325	109930	For those who have not been following the drama, OrangeLawnsRadio.com has been down due to some stuff and things.
109990	110650	We'll leave it at that.
111431	112312	And out of our control.
112772	114794	And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes.
114894	120899	Namely, and I want to give a shout out to Jason and Deekman behind the scenes have ensured that it will be back up.
120959	121579	Now, here's the thing.
121880	124302	I could flip the switch right now and some people would see it.
124722	127103	But it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out.
127123	130865	The way DNS works, it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours.
132306	132766	Exactly.
132866	142770	So that also keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.
143211	143651	Stop.
144151	147832	Alright, but anyhow, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.
147852	152693	We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site so everybody will get the show and we'll have a website again.
152733	153134	Yay!
153214	154014	You better watch out though.
154054	158935	If they catch you pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison for no reason.
159375	160556	Why are we talking about this?
161896	163698	I'm trying to be happy about the show.
163878	164598	I'm happy.
164638	165679	Coming back for the show.
165739	167020	Yay.
167701	168121	Party.
168301	168862	All right, anyhow.
169302	170303	OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
170583	174346	By the time the podcast-y people download this and hear it, it's probably back up and running.
174687	177109	Live listeners, you're finding out about two minutes after I did.
177329	178770	I said you all would be the first to know.
179030	179390	Yay.
179410	184054	So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, because right now I'm trying to do a show.
184514	185775	Why are you showing me up your sleeve?
186256	187417	I'm looking at my fake watch.
188079	191978	even though we are not televised I'm still going through motions and looking at my fake watch
193604	197526	Anyhow, what else was I going to say?
197646	198226	Damn you, woman.
198266	198866	You threw me off.
201207	202688	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
202788	203448	It does work.
203608	207170	It's up right now, even on the backup site for the folks listening live.
207210	219315	We do encourage you to join our chat room at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want, such as Jim Sally in our chat room says, 24-hour pirate special at OLR.com.
220076	220096	R.
221912	227194	You can get lots of booty at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright, um Yes, what?
227334	236937	You have that look on your face like I have something smart ass I'm gonna say Yes, but it doesn't fit into the conversation that we're having right now Does it ever fit into the conversation we're having right now?
237318	240279	It's unfortunately a week too late A week too late?
240519	244940	Yes, it is a week too late Alright, now I have to know, what's your week old joke?
245340	248982	Say it Well, the Xbox Luba has a slick interface
251014	251836	No, it's still funny.
253378	254701	Xbox lube jokes are still funny.
255021	260110	It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website.
260190	260631	But there will be.
262293	262673	Anyhow.
263574	263995	All right, look.
264956	266777	I want to talk about other exciting things.
267158	271341	Not only is our website coming back up, but there's an awesome charity event.
271381	272803	We've pimped this on the show for years.
273103	278628	There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday, in San Francisco.
278648	282552	So if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you need to go to this event because I'm going to be there.
282872	283953	DarkSakura's going to be there.
284293	285855	Loki, you're not going to be there.
287216	290564	I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part of it.
290624	292809	I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim.
294171	297058	The moment I said that, Shermie looked up at me like, the hell you will.
298018	305143	But here's the thing, DarkSakura and I are going to San Francisco, and Salacious doesn't call, we don't call Salacious Pop anymore, but Alan is going to.
305163	316371	To be very honest, you know, had I not been locked into the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have bid and won that, uh, the be on the stage thing, you know.
317111	318512	Oh yeah, I know, do the rock band.
318532	320574	Because I like winning eBay auctions, so you know.
320914	321534	Well, let me back up.
321554	325155	For those that don't know what Loom Loud is, because I know we've talked about this for years on the show.
325195	330137	We're very grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like... Some people in chat were mentioning earlier, I've been listening for five years.
330477	332378	I've been listening since this was single digits on the show.
333898	335059	We've been pimping this for a long time.
335099	335979	It's a great charity event.
336019	339440	It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA Lounge, which is an actual venue.
339460	341661	And there's a lot of famous stuff that happens at DNA Lounge.
342441	344242	Club Booty is one of the biggest examples of that.
344282	347863	That's the mashup club night where they actually mash songs together.
347883	348363	And some of those...
348683	350644	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
377762	405521	and that money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event which is really worth it alone but you get to pick a prize off the swag table and I'm not allowed to say what I know about the swag table this year but there's like really good stuff that people are going to walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event and they're going to be doing a raffle they're going to be doing these silent auctions I don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction I don't know what I can and can't say so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty but I will say
406061	434484	but I will say this the silent auction stuff is amazing too like one of the items in particular oh my god oh my god anybody that like grew up on an NES is gonna lose their shit over this it's amazing so and I can't remember if that's one of the eBay ones or not because yes you're gonna be able to participate online as well and you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and and and this is so cool you're gonna get to watch it online it's all streaming at umloud.org and why am I pimping this so bad?
435543	465139	I'd be pimping it anyway but I'm especially pimping it because there's a live pre-show for the first time ever that's going to be happening video from it and they asked me to co-host so I'm going to be doing it with some other friends in the gaming community including Carnage who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff which will be very cool some other folks from other websites are involved too so it's no like singular website doing it this is not an OLR show it's just we're helping we're one of the cooks in the kitchen with this
465699	466941	and it's going to be great.
467201	473266	Met a lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place and yeah, it's going to be a kick-ass show.
473307	474708	So make plans to be here.
474788	481754	Thursday, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern, umloud.org.
482015	483436	Now you have no excuse not to be there.
483716	485138	It's going to be delivered to your house.
485632	486353	Thank you for watching!
504868	511071	We are going to lend our full support and if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what?
511291	512211	We'll have a drink together.
512351	513372	I can say at least that much.
513552	513752	Yeah.
513892	514952	We're not really going to make out with you.
515292	515432	No.
515873	516093	Okay.
516353	517593	And DarkSakura will not show you her boobs.
518073	518374	No.
519474	522275	But I am the designer this year.
523836	531219	I will not say much more than that but you get to see my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall.
531399	531559	Mm-hmm.
532660	533541	and other things.
534262	534763	Good stuff.
535284	535785	So yeah.
536305	541173	And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little creepy because I don't do video.
541313	541894	Like I've done...
542711	567278	you can see my work on that too I've done audio stuff since 97 so this is one of the first I mean besides back when we were doing the Justin TV like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show which I don't think makes for exciting video but some people miss it maybe it'll come back someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it but yeah I'm excited I'm into it I'm happy
567881	569902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
592990	596833	Granted to borrow, not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months.
599014	602557	You completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister.
603377	605559	From the dollar store, yes.
606680	610382	I got Rob a penguin snow globe at the dollar store.
610482	612303	It was the thought that counts.
612364	615246	I waited in line twice as long as I spent shopping.
616006	618328	I hate the dollar store this time of year.
620063	632778	Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler At least he's a little balder than me But cuter Which isn't saying much
635020	635340	Anyhow.
636221	636541	All right.
638683	640044	Look, it's not about that.
640104	642066	It's about getting you guys to show up.
642206	643207	They know.
643547	644047	This is the thing.
644087	647530	They know that the OLR and that the All Games people are rabid people.
647910	651733	And when we will do this stuff, they're more likely to show up.
651753	653275	So you guys have to represent.
653895	655496	Not just OLR, but all games.
655636	658799	And show up and cheer loudly and be excited about Umlaut.
658879	660820	And most of all, please donate.
660960	664723	I know it's a tough time of year, but keep in mind the charity.
664763	667284	There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher.
667605	670367	And we're going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity.
670487	674409	So again, umlaut.org on Thursday.
675470	675871	All righty.
677012	677772	How about video games?
677792	680535	Let's get back into how our gaming weeks were and all that good stuff.
680555	682617	We always like to kick off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
682957	684138	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
684258	685660	I played stuff that wasn't well.
686140	687301	That made me play well, too.
688542	690865	Last night started the family tradition.
691385	693687	We broke out the Saturn and played Christmas nights.
694348	695349	Oh, it must be the holidays.
696710	700554	And then we realized that our battery wasn't working, so we couldn't save anything.
701301	704805	Dan decided that he was going to play Rayearth anyway, so he started playing Rayearth.
705886	708269	I finally played my copy of P.O.P.O.
708590	710271	2 on the Sega Saturn, and you know what?
710312	711233	That game sucks.
711993	714316	Not that it sucks that it's a bad game, because P.O.P.O.
714356	714917	is awesome.
715337	716799	It kicked my ass.
717119	718721	I am that out of practice on P.O.P.O.
719982	747950	and we played through Parodius Da we played through GKL Parodius sorry, Gokujil Parodius we played through a little bit of Oshaberry Parodius a lot of Parodius Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn and then he beat Thunder Force 3
749995	750515	On Saturn.
750916	752016	Like, just sat down and played.
752036	755859	There's apparently something called Kids Mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields.
756940	759381	So he was just doing Stress Relief Mode, pretty much.
761983	773531	I played, actually, some of the Blue Seed RPG, until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG, because I read like a retarded five-year-old in Japanese.
773571	776453	You had quite the Sega-filled retro week, didn't you?
776473	776993	There's more.
777273	777573	Oh my.
777834	778974	I found my Utena game.
780115	780595	I didn't play it.
780655	781636	Was that the Dish game?
782397	785098	No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura.
785298	786499	I can never remember these things.
786659	789061	But there was Clamp involved because I played Rayearth.
790081	794524	And I was going to play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or anything.
797006	800027	Also, I bought Dan's present.
800608	801769	Don't tell him anybody.
802469	806531	It's... That's what Dan got.
807993	808934	I'm not going to repeat that.
810136	813040	I'm not going to tell anybody why I got Dan because they'll tell him because of freaking internet.
813420	814542	People can't keep a secret.
814602	815223	What's up with that?
818087	821672	And then I bathed the cat.
823803	825004	That's a game all in itself.
825964	829926	That's just... See what offended faces Shermie can make at you.
830466	832467	She's asleep in her bed now, but she doesn't... She does look cleaner.
832988	833768	She's a lot cleaner.
833888	835609	She doesn't smell like her ass anymore.
836570	838170	That's a good thing when she's right underneath me.
838190	839651	She doesn't smell like old lady anymore.
840071	840392	All right.
840532	844474	I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like cat old lady.
844574	846615	Comments from chat.orangelontrady.com.
846735	851517	Actdeft in our chat room says, It's officially the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights.
852098	852558	That is true.
852578	852818	Do-do.
854373	854753	Let's see.
854993	856874	Misty says, woo, kid mode.
856914	857654	Sounds good for me.
858295	858495	Right?
858655	859035	Preach it.
859355	871379	I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate last night, that Dan was, the little night song was playing, and I remembered the whole thing.
872020	873140	I was singing along with it.
873700	878662	The other thing I remembered the whole thing of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese.
878822	879503	You know why that is?
879823	880023	What?
880043	880903	Because you're a nerd.
881563	882304	I love this song.
882344	883164	It's a cute song.
883624	883904	All right.
884545	885766	Loki, how was your gaming week?
885786	887668	Did you play any old-school Sega?
888028	892252	I, too, broke out the Sega Saturn to play Hanukkah Nights.
892392	895335	It's not quite as popular as Christmas Nights.
895455	896696	But there's eight stages.
896816	898498	Eight stages, and it's a little longer.
899059	900440	So it was pretty good.
902902	916568	No, actually I played lots of Skyrim and ran across my fair share of glitches, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity on Facebook.
918350	927816	I fought a dragon, and all of a sudden it froze for a second, and then this giant dirt thing was in front of me.
927977	934461	We'll have to post it to the Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing down here.
934761	937823	Just to give you an idea of how tall this thing is, it's just ridiculous.
937843	939564	It's like an old faithful made out of dirt.
940898	941659	Yeah, pretty much.
941999	944741	And it is completely non-solid.
944761	945622	You can just run right through it.
945682	947623	I was like, oh, big mountain that it created.
948264	950065	And it's weird.
950365	959532	That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, today I was playing, all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like...
960313	964695	Wait, this is that same dragon I just killed, like, hours ago, days ago.
965175	966855	It just fell from the sky again.
968496	969236	It's so glitchy.
969556	975899	I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple weeks just because of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but I really need to play it more.
976399	976779	God.
976899	977659	Fucking chat.
978319	978519	What?
978800	979520	What did chat do now?
980500	982421	They're making assumptions, so I just said it.
982441	982942	You're dirty.
983942	987104	So, yeah, I mean, I haven't really been doing anything.
987144	994168	I actually had to force myself to go to the next actual quest or the storyline quest.
995449	999871	But along the way, of course, I had to waste a bunch of time and went back to Helgen and...
1001372	1003254	I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.
1003274	1005475	I got a dragon flying backwards today.
1005495	1006576	That's about it.
1028873	1029233	Yeah, 360.
1029313	1031334	I was playing on PS3.
1031374	1032795	I didn't notice any bugs, really.
1033035	1039318	I'm playing still on the last patch, the 1.1, because I'm not dumb enough to download 1.2.
1040479	1042640	I'm just like, nope, I'm not going to download that.
1043521	1048664	I like having magical resistance and stuff like that, and my dragons flying forward.
1051385	1070601	so I've been playing that and then actually I'm setting up my JTAG to play once I'm done how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can port over the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a JTAG
1071281	1072342	Which is fantastic.
1072862	1074543	And so you can do a bunch of cool things with that.
1075264	1076865	Of course, I'm not doing that right now.
1076905	1078466	I'm actually just playing legitimately.
1078906	1100841	Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their belongings, which is never a good idea because I started selling some firewood back to one of the inns or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place.
1101662	1103123	of everything that was not steel.
1104064	1106806	And so now people eating, I'm taking your food.
1107667	1109169	Just all sorts of fun stuff like that.
1109409	1109729	Awesome.
1111271	1112131	Hey, you helped them out.
1112492	1113272	What's theirs is yours.
1113733	1114253	Exactly.
1114373	1116536	And then I sold it back to them, which is great.
1119410	1120791	You can do some mean things in Skyrim.
1120811	1122352	There's some really funny stuff.
1122392	1125775	I went to this one fort, and all these bandits were running around.
1125795	1129658	There was this old woman, and she's like, I come with the fort.
1129678	1131079	There's people coming and going.
1131139	1132661	I don't know who's taking over.
1132801	1134642	One side wins, the other side comes back.
1135563	1139146	So meanwhile, all these bandits are attacking it, and I'm attacking them.
1139426	1141348	And she's like, I think you should leave.
1141368	1144711	And she's following me around saying, I think you should leave.
1145632	1146433	It was hilarious.
1146453	1148155	I'm like, I'm going to kill you, bitch.
1148495	1150217	You keep fucking talking to me.
1151118	1155022	And then she finally, she's still there, but now the Imperial forces are there.
1155523	1162150	But it's hilarious, because she's like, these people that have captured her, she's just like, I think you should go.
1162170	1164393	I'm like, well, no, I'm not going to.
1166038	1195904	you know the thing Skyrim obviously is doing amazingly well you know and it's a single player game and everything and I notice a lot of what makes single player games really transcend into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like Grand Theft Auto 4 or Grand Theft Auto 3 which while granted they do have their multiplayer modes they're probably more known for their single player I think these games that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable yeah stuff that the people create in the environments and
1196064	1197246	The Turd Has Its Own Microcosm
1210171	1211452	Yeah, I really do.
1211572	1216877	I'm probably going to go back to Saints Row again because I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't have all the achievements yet.
1217497	1224664	I'm almost there, but I really hated doing the car theft missions and so I didn't.
1225284	1229928	And then I also had to replay the game as a female character for at least two hours and get that achievement.
1231630	1235453	And then I had to finish some of the other story missions in a different way than I did before.
1236033	1237775	But, you know, it's almost at the end.
1238295	1242418	The other thing I played this week also was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1, you know, Call of Duty 4.
1243679	1246321	Now we're playing just regular free-for-all deathmatches.
1246341	1255207	We're going old-school free-for-all deathmatches, which is kind of a little bit like Grand Theft Auto deathmatches where you start off with the same weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along.
1255547	1259650	So it's kind of fun just mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game eventually.
1260090	1262852	The problem is, so it's like every time I'm like, okay, I gotta work on the mod game.
1264002	1267043	or I can play Skyrim and usually Skyrim wins out, you know.
1267203	1268404	Yeah, I know how it goes.
1269284	1273826	That game, literally, it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it.
1274126	1275447	I collect shit.
1276007	1276907	I hoard it all.
1276927	1278188	What's your wife's opinion?
1278208	1279828	Your wife pretty much hates video games.
1279848	1280629	She's reading books.
1280689	1281269	She doesn't care.
1282369	1285511	The only thing I heard out of her like yesterday was, oh, that's pretty.
1285891	1287952	You know, because, you know, it's the environment and stuff.
1288152	1288572	It is pretty.
1288792	1292075	But, like, you know, I attacked a mammoth the other day and stuff.
1292135	1293636	I killed a couple bears today.
1294576	1295397	They're pissing me off.
1295737	1296278	That's right.
1296498	1297819	Did you find the cave of bears?
1298079	1299320	Yes, I did find the cave of bears.
1299360	1299580	Yes.
1301121	1303503	I don't know if it was... It's right outside one of the quest towns.
1303723	1306566	It's called, like, Bear Cave or something like that.
1306786	1306926	Oh.
1307106	1308867	You go in and it's nothing but bears.
1309528	1311289	There was two bears in a cave that I found.
1311309	1312130	I don't think it was that.
1312190	1315132	It was on my way to... I don't remember the damn town names.
1315152	1316073	Yeah, I remember it's been a while.
1316093	1316193	Yeah.
1316233	1316373	Yeah.
1317674	1319095	Alright, anything else for your week you want to share?
1319855	1320156	That's it.
1320456	1320696	Alright.
1321336	1323998	My game of the week, actually not quite as exciting as my co-host this week.
1324058	1325879	I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week.
1327360	1335165	I wanted to get Mario Kart 7 today, but I neglected to order online, and now that I'm trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it until after Christmas.
1335185	1335846	I'm like, screw you!
1336707	1341933	So I want to know, I was literally next door to an evil G today and I still didn't want to go in.
1341973	1343755	I'm like, I'll wait till I go to Target later in the week.
1344316	1348641	So yeah, no Mario Kart 7 for me today, but I will get it this week.
1348701	1350243	Just things are a little bit crazy right now.
1350263	1354869	As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier, prepping for Thursday and just everything else going on with my day job.
1355129	1356209	Darkmoon Faire Darkmoon Faire
1377694	1378535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1393424	1394084	www.hoardhouse.com
1412610	1422738	You'll have to forgive me, I forgot the name Somebody in chat I'm sure will yell it out But it's the bundle that had Cthulhu, Saves the World It's like a big something bundle I don't know Yeah, and then it had a really Big world bundle maybe?
1422758	1440192	Yeah, it had a really neat sounding game in it Which between that and the Xbox Live Indie games that I'd played before I knew it would be worth it It was like poker mixed with puzzle game mixed with RPG It sounded really cool So I wanted to play that I just didn't get around to it this week
1440952	1443795	because, again, new WoW patch, busy day life.
1443955	1446357	It'd be awesome if it was Swords and Poker for the PC.
1447057	1448198	It is not Swords and Poker PC.
1448218	1449679	It's something else.
1449899	1451420	That was another game that took over my life.
1451681	1455504	Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't even get the answer for them.
1457478	1457758	We'll see.
1457778	1459039	It'll come up in a little while, I'm sure.
1459780	1469749	See, the problem with those indie bundles is I'm not buying any more until I play the one that I have, and I've only played one game out of it, VVVV.
1471711	1474533	I still haven't played all the other ones out of that Humble Indie Bundle.
1476335	1479438	So, yeah, it'll probably be a while before I buy any more of those.
1479978	1485706	Actually, I was looking a little bit on Xbox Indie Games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet.
1486166	1487548	And I thought about buying some stuff.
1487568	1488990	I almost bought DLC Quest.
1489050	1494477	But then I was like, how often would I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff?
1494537	1495879	So it'll be something that I...
1497040	1523242	purchase later on all right thank you guys thank you chat room chat.orangelandradio.com it was Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle it's done that was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it I don't know but it's done so unfortunately you can't buy this now but let's see unless maybe you can now the current minimum is done it says or beat the minimum I don't know what the minimum is
1523911	1552887	I don't know if you can still buy it but you look down here and it says one minute five seconds ago they were still selling it so I don't think you can let me try four dollars go see if it'll work but anyway it had Breath of Death Cthulhu Saves the World the game I was trying to think of Rune Spell Overture that's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out so there you go and sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore I think it's done so can't get it now
1555242	1563925	Alright, chat.orange.com if you want to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.
1564905	1565205	Awesome.
1566126	1567326	Some other things we want to plug.
1567366	1568106	Lol, you're old.
1568946	1569227	Right?
1569287	1571787	I was talking about this earlier and they were like, no, you're not old.
1571807	1573768	It's like, no, I'm forgetting things left and right.
1576809	1580271	A couple other things we wanted to mention before we get into tonight's news.
1580311	1583893	I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet.
1583913	1586475	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

1600683	1602784	Just search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google+.

1606897	1607377	So there you go.
1607737	1611119	Many ways you can interact with the show and talk to us and say hello.
1611660	1616942	And thank God there will be a mailbag again next week, hopefully as well, if we're getting the old website back.
1616982	1618263	So that should be up midweek or so.
1619043	1619304	All right.
1619784	1621265	Let's get into some gaming news.
1621525	1623646	Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight.
1624028	1629873	Yes, so lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation Vita.
1630154	1636440	And of course, one of the things that people are wondering is, how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us?
1637180	1639062	Of course, it's going to be something reasonable, right?
1639382	1639662	Right?
1640183	1640463	Right?
1640864	1641104	No?
1643486	1644167	Actually, no.
1644227	1647069	They're pretty high priced.
1649854	1651915	Or as you might say, not reasonable.
1652396	1653897	Yes, not reasonable at all.
1654897	1673391	Apparently, they're saying that according to GameStop, or the Evil G if you will, they have it listed on their website that the 4GB card is going to be $29.99, although they have, I guess, Sony has told some websites that the 4GB cards actually retail for $24.99, 8GB cards for $39.99.
1676954	1686713	But, but, I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it listed for.
1689525	1697031	So beyond the 4 and 8 gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will run you $69.99, and 32 will be $119.99.
1697131	1702035	Why is this important?
1702195	1703356	Because they're required.
1703636	1708179	You need to have a memory card to play your games, for the most part.
1708499	1715845	Most games require the memory card, and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory card in order to do that.
1716205	1718087	And it's proprietary, so you can't just, you know...
1718827	1723230	Get an SD card or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper.
1723471	1728594	But, you know, hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right?
1728694	1731436	That's what their fear is, or they're going to hack the system somehow.
1732597	1733618	I can tell you this much, Sony.
1733658	1738962	They're going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have.
1739442	1740283	It's just going to happen.
1740703	1742864	So I have to have a memory card.
1743665	1746726	And is Sony selling a bundle that includes a memory card?
1746866	1752309	They're going to have launch bundles or whatever that come with like a two gigabyte one, I think.
1752889	1762414	Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, oh my God, I can't believe they're releasing the Vita for $250.
1762655	1767897	That is in fact a lie because $250 doesn't get you a memory card.
1768137	1768698	Am I correct?
1769358	1770499	Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah.
1770819	1772400	But some games do not require it.
1773081	1773321	Okay.
1773801	1780426	Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves, and they also have storage for download content and stuff like that.
1780586	1785149	Some other games require memory cards for that storage as well.
1785790	1790173	I was going to say, if these stupid things are required, then the system's not really $250, is it?
1790233	1797738	But because there is that little, you know, we call that a loophole, where it's like, okay, well, really, you can play some games without one, right?
1798078	1801339	Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360, remember when they first released it?
1801359	1805761	You don't have to get a hard drive, but, you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever.
1806741	1810302	But they're a little ridiculous, and I mean, I understand the price of memory.
1810982	1814504	I'm sorry, that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards.
1815604	1817545	Especially when everything else is way cheaper.
1817585	1822066	I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive prices.
1822466	1823767	I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120?
1823807	1823887	Yeah.
1827388	1846321	I'm sorry, you can get a 250GB hard drive for probably about $30 if not cheaper than that and it's just such a high markup and it's not anything really special either it's just a laptop hard drive formatted a special way which you can get any laptop drive and format it that special way if you have the right software to do that
1846812	1850674	Now, some of our folks in the chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing.
1850755	1855197	And so like SSJ100Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now upwards from $350.
1855237	1858639	And Avakan Anagram is like, no, it's $250 plus $25.
1859260	1862282	You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is nice.
1862762	1866765	TigerClaw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video player.
1866785	1872648	And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD Passport thing?
1872788	1874910	Let me get this right.
1875550	1889753	If I want to play Luminous old school all over again, assuming it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is, I need to buy the right to get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some of these games on.
1890014	1890214	Yes.
1890274	1894915	Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game would just cost me used anyway.
1896275	1897696	to just play on my old PSP.
1897996	1898237	Yes.
1898337	1901419	Logic doesn't apply when it comes to new video games, Rob.
1902320	1902540	I know.
1902580	1908685	It's just... It's so interesting to me because what got everybody excited about the Vita?
1908745	1912548	What truly got everybody like, fuck yeah, Sony Vita!
1912888	1914510	What got everybody really excited about it?
1914690	1915270	The price.
1915671	1916111	The back touch.
1916131	1916972	It was that price.
1917052	1918093	No, it was not the back touch.
1918113	1919013	It was not the reach around.
1919674	1921495	It was that $250 price.
1921615	1923397	And now it's kind of like, oh, but it's...
1925174	1927935	Yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know.
1928835	1935436	Oh, by the way, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how we were talking last week about Ridge Racer?
1935956	1939697	There's another thing to lose a little excitement about the Vita over.
1940117	1945098	Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little bit cheaper than your average PlayStation game.
1946778	1952880	It's $29.99, whereas your average going cost for a Vita game is going to be $39.99.
1956673	1961040	So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the game.
1962282	1962923	Fantastic.
1964285	1964886	It's awesome.
1964906	1965747	You know what?
1965808	1966489	I'm going to save myself $30.
1967290	1968492	I'm just not going to buy that game.
1970194	1997448	you know I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am a consumer whore and I want all the new toys but I'm finding myself a little less excited than I was a few months ago I mean at the end of the day it's all about games it is all about the game and if there is a truly like kick ass oh my god blow my mind game on this thing like you know I gotta say Luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic if there's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita then you know
1998621	2000003	All this stuff seems a little less.
2000023	2000964	Maybe it's worth waiting.
2001004	2006351	Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that.
2006552	2010837	Being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything.
2011158	2014021	It nets you a bunch of problems and a more expensive price point.
2014682	2015243	That is it.
2015523	2016264	What are you going to net?
2017266	2019348	Oh, I get to play some of these games early.
2019388	2021211	Well, it's all Generation 1 stuff.
2021231	2023814	I mean, is there really anything super fantastic?
2023834	2028080	I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then Uncharted game might be worth it to you.
2028500	2032846	I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan, but I'm not buying Ridge Racer.
2033346	2041889	I don't really care about a new LittleBigPlanet game or ports of a bunch of older games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or UFC game, MMA stuff.
2049211	2051653	I just don't care that they're porting that stuff over right now.
2052133	2053194	Our chat room is on fire.
2053314	2056096	It is literally burning with conversation on this whole thing.
2056756	2058277	Alfcananagram's talking about the bundle.
2058397	2060239	The PlayStation Vita first edition bundle.
2060579	2067063	PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, 4 gigabyte card, and little deviants, $349.
2067203	2068464	God, I sound like a PR dude.
2068784	2070526	I gotta admit, not all that stuff interests me.
2070966	2075849	I'm probably gonna want a card more than 4 gigabits and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3G.
2075969	2076670	Like, I don't need it.
2077190	2081299	I think they have one that's without the 3G as well but I'm not sure if that's available over here.
2081379	2082542	I think that's only in Canada.
2083914	2085115	I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.
2108055	2110957	Alright, one more comment I'm going to get to here from a private message.
2111097	2114158	Usually I don't read private messages because I'm like, talk in the main room.
2114879	2119001	But I'll let Miklatov have this one because he did guest on Horde House earlier today, so he did me a favor.
2119061	2121582	But anyway, even though he only did a mediocre job.
2121662	2122543	No, just kidding, just kidding.
2123623	2125205	I just want to give him to alt tab and say something angry.
2126025	2135072	Miklatov says, Rumor has it that the memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus retail box.
2135132	2136874	Yeah, but here's the thing about that.
2136974	2141698	That's all rumor, and I don't know if that's actually true or not.
2142098	2149544	And on top of that, all that is is just incentivizing you to buy the more expensive memory card because...
2150262	2154546	At the end of the day, say you buy a 4GB stick, what's that going to hold?
2154626	2155287	One or two games?
2156208	2159571	I mean, that's not going to offset the price of that memory card.
2162674	2173384	All I have to say is the more and more we talk about all this, and please let that 40% thing be true, because once that news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react?
2176035	2183278	I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.
2184739	2187000	The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen.
2187640	2190661	Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy, GameStop included.
2191002	2191642	Well, here's the thing.
2192362	2194683	How long is it until the Vita comes out in Japan?
2194763	2196404	I mean, isn't that like right around the corner?
2198016	2224951	yeah it's like the 17th I thought the price points that they had for games on I don't know if that's just been announced yet but I don't think it's going to be 40% I think it's going to be either the same price or just slightly under not 40% if it is 40% cool then that way maybe it gets more people to buy their games or whatever or people just be more selective in what they buy
2226405	2228306	All right, let's move on with another story.
2228346	2229846	This is also about Sony.
2229946	2235148	I don't know what to think of this news, and I think a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either.
2235688	2241110	There are rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony.
2241390	2241690	Ueda.
2241990	2242771	Ueda, excuse me.
2242831	2244691	He's quit Sony, and why is this important?
2244831	2249633	Oh, he's the creative lead behind Team Ico, which is creating The Last Guardian.
2250932	2251953	Remember The Last Guardian?
2252293	2252673	Remember that?
2252713	2258115	That was that game that showed up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good.
2258515	2260877	And then it was suddenly absent this year.
2261697	2264938	And yeah, apparently he is left.
2265378	2266439	The game hasn't come out yet.
2267960	2272422	Maybe that explains why it was supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not.
2273862	2276403	Supposedly he is working on the project still.
2276463	2277524	He's freelancing.
2278164	2305852	but uh yeah interesting Sony was asked to comment on the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation right okay be interesting to see how that impacts that game especially if they announce it now for the 360 and the Wii U maybe that's the surprise it's on the Wii U Wii U what about the Wii U Loki
2307998	2308699	Thanks for watching!
2325075	2326596	It doesn't do anything yet.
2326756	2330058	It's just a video with some tech demos and shit.
2330238	2337822	They don't actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that doesn't, but at E3, that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware.
2338042	2351009	All I'm saying is that if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you Shadow of the Colossus and Ico, comes the last Guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just be like, I don't give a fuck.
2351229	2352530	This is what you're going to hear in the audience.
2358165	2363407	They're not gonna... It's not gonna go to any other platform other than Sony.
2363687	2364627	I guarantee it.
2364767	2366088	It's not gonna happen.
2366588	2368929	He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit.
2369129	2370850	It's not fun to fantasize about.
2372611	2373231	Who cares?
2373391	2373671	I mean...
2374963	2375523	Retail Exclusive
2406494	2408256	It's not just the game stuff.
2408376	2419506	I know, but... They said Nintendo of America has said that it's going to be out in April 2012.
2419647	2427994	But I mean, why... Why not have just already put it out?
2428835	2429436	It's in English.
2431017	2431338	It's there.
2431358	2431558	It's there.
2433206	2433706	Why wait?
2434187	2439210	Because, DarkSakura, they have to remove the U's and put the Z's back in.
2439451	2440351	So what?
2442713	2443614	So what?
2444914	2446696	Excuse me, the Z's.
2447676	2449918	And all the Z's are now Z's.
2450198	2455022	So maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look nonsensical.
2455842	2457764	Americans won't understand it.
2457804	2459145	So yogurt has an H in it.
2461286	2463447	Is there yogurt in the Xenoblade Chronicles?
2463487	2465668	I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.
2465708	2466829	There probably is yogurt.
2470091	2472312	Just... You know what?
2472932	2476234	Just for that, I'm still gonna get the British one.
2476614	2476774	Look.
2479804	2481987	I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this.
2482147	2483329	No, I haven't pre-ordered it.
2483449	2484290	I have until April.
2484330	2485832	Why pre-order it today?
2486493	2489477	I don't need to pre-order this.
2490418	2497687	I do because I really feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to fail?
2498668	2500029	Have you ever heard that before?
2500230	2501651	You're setting me up to fail.
2502351	2503392	At work all the time.
2503692	2506294	I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying.
2506354	2509737	It's a very, very thing you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail.
2509937	2510297	Yes, they do.
2510317	2512078	We're not a company that sets people up to fail.
2512119	2512519	Yes, they do.
2512539	2513019	Okay.
2515621	2517803	I feel like this game is being set up to fail.
2518567	2518727	Yeah.
2519808	2527035	And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic.
2527916	2529657	I mean, for a Wii game.
2532940	2534222	At the end of the day, a game is a game.
2534502	2535423	And even though it's a...
2535723	2539744	Really, really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game.
2540164	2543605	It's still a really good RPG that any RPG fan needs to experience.
2543685	2544045	For real.
2544385	2544885	I mean, for real.
2544925	2547746	I mean, so what if it doesn't have the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff?
2548106	2550267	We pimp classic games here on the show all the time.
2550327	2556788	It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games in the slightest because this game does a lot.
2556888	2560349	And, like, seriously, when you do play it, you're like, this is a Wii game?
2560989	2563270	Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.
2563390	2563910	And they should!
2564730	2565291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2575337	2579681	Like Loki said earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox Lube joke because it was a week old.
2580501	2584965	Well, this game is coming out like years after it came out in Japan at this point, right?
2585005	2586887	It's got to be at least a year since it's out in Japan.
2587467	2590350	At least six months from Europe, for sure.
2590810	2592391	And for what reason, we don't know.
2592411	2595394	Who already really wanted it has pirated it.
2597537	2598197	Let me put it this way.
2598217	2606208	If you're translating from English to English, English, English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week to finish that.
2606448	2610514	I mean... It's called Find and Replace.
2611295	2611435	Yeah.
2612516	2615557	I mean, I don't see how that would be that difficult to go through there.
2615757	2619799	And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the words that's spelled in English English.
2620719	2621480	Who cares?
2621820	2622880	People are going to be able to read it.
2623040	2623521	And you know what?
2623921	2627882	Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was misspelled in the first place.
2628202	2632044	Or it's spelled correctly, but just not in the way that we may spell it correctly.
2632324	2632964	Who gives a shit?
2633205	2634305	You can understand it.
2634625	2641411	So, for one, it's coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it.
2641871	2647055	So now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's going to be honest about it and actually buy the game if they pirated it?
2647616	2654321	Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever, at least they haven't said.
2654942	2654962	I...
2656283	2656783	Thanks for watching!
2673436	2675297	I bet it comes out and all that shit is still in there.
2675317	2677158	I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all.
2697970	2699351	So, what do you want to bet?
2699371	2699991	We'll see, we'll see.
2700511	2703952	But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release thing.
2704592	2705393	What does this tell you?
2705453	2713136	If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really going to do a lot of marketing behind this.
2713156	2715096	You're not going to see Xenoblade TV commercials.
2715116	2717297	You're not going to see magazine ads really a whole lot.
2717337	2718798	Maybe onesie twosie here and there.
2719298	2720638	GameStop might promote it a little bit.
2720658	2722059	Game Informer will probably have an ad for it.
2722079	2722339	That's true.
2722359	2723459	Game Informer will probably have it.
2723479	2724480	And they are a big magazine.
2725200	2736236	but it's not going to be quite that campaign you would see behind old say Mario Kart 3DS or you know some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going on right now which it just seems like they're just going to here
2737594	2743339	Well, it's all about exposing themselves to loss.
2745682	2752508	History has shown with games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's not going to sell very well.
2752848	2758294	I mean, look at Mad World, look at even some of the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff.
2758694	2759034	It just...
2760115	2761056	It looks good.
2761336	2765419	It could be really cutting edge as far as the technology behind it or something like that.
2765519	2766780	Or it can be really edgy.
2766940	2768382	It's like a violent game and stuff.
2768762	2772425	But people can hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell.
2772625	2784274	And unfortunately, for Nintendo to publish this and to bring it over here, it's a risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing money.
2785054	2792520	They're not doing any marketing, but spend some money on another Mario Kart game or another Mario game that they know they're going to sell millions of copies of.
2792920	2804949	But at the same time, they want to not lose all their cred with hardcore gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer.
2805129	2806430	At least that's what they're trying to
2807678	2808999	This is how they're skewing it right now.
2809379	2812260	Ninja Gaiden is going to be on.
2812580	2815121	There's a Ghost Recon game that's going to be on.
2815181	2821384	It's going to have all these publishers backing it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want the hardcore games to come back.
2823866	2824807	all this makes me miss working designs
2843949	2846713	GameGuru GameStop probably paid for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive.
2864595	2865516	I don't know.
2865896	2869879	I worry at the end of the day it's not going to sell as much as it should.
2870519	2873521	And then Nintendo's going to say, well, this is why you can't have nice things.
2874362	2879946	We were gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall and it didn't sell.
2879986	2881226	So no last story for you.
2881246	2881527	Goodbye.
2882087	2882788	Here's why I say that.
2882908	2883228	Fuck them.
2883368	2884028	Because you know what?
2884128	2885890	I don't need them to bring out fucking RPGs.
2885910	2887691	They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want.
2887851	2888431	Because guess what?
2888651	2890653	This world has multiple publishers.
2891113	2898685	It's full of publishers that bring out RPGs like Atlus or Exceed or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs.
2898825	2899226	And guess what?
2899286	2901630	I don't need you to fucking bring over anything.
2901870	2905676	You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports games, your stupid...
2906357	2911558	If there's another goddamn game with Woohoo Island in it, I don't give a fuck if Woohoo Island is in there.
2911678	2912638	It's not a landmark.
2912819	2915119	It's not something like, oh my god, there's islands in here.
2915159	2917260	It's such a character, as they put it.
2917580	2918420	I don't fucking care.
2918580	2925861	Hey, why don't you put Woohoo Island in fucking Xenoblade or whatever, because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are going to want to see that.
2925901	2929882	And hell, Mario is a playable character, since it's a Nintendo published game.
2929902	2931303	It's got to have fucking Mario in it.
2931343	2932203	Mamma mia.
2932583	2936767	So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't brain out over here.
2937047	2941592	And if they're like, well, see, we listened to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through.
2941752	2942513	Well, fuck you.
2942533	2942953	You know what?
2942993	2949499	Because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit, and sure, people are going to cream themselves over goddamn Zelda.
2949619	2952982	And to be fair... I was going to say, hold on.
2953603	2954124	Hold on.
2954484	2957226	Because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward Sword...
2958208	2959869	Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing.
2959909	2960649	I haven't played it myself.
2961049	2966552	But that Mario 3DS game, I will tell you firsthand, is that good?
2967312	2967572	Okay.
2967792	2971934	To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy.
2972295	2973515	It's not a Xenoblade.
2973715	2974856	It's a different type of game.
2974996	2976677	It's an adventure game, if you will.
2976777	2977717	It's not an RPG.
2978077	2979178	It's an adventure game.
2979898	2980098	and so on.
2994835	2995516	Thanks for watching!
3011894	3013035	And then they never did it again.
3013215	3014036	Oh, I'm sorry.
3014096	3015857	They did it once in Endless Ocean.
3016158	3017158	But who gives a fuck?
3017218	3018479	No one bought Endless Ocean.
3018640	3021162	It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game.
3021202	3024324	If I want to go snorkeling, I will go outside and go snorkeling.
3024705	3026526	I don't need to play a game to simulate that.
3027026	3033852	But that was like the two times that they ever used that stupid SD memory card slot for anything other than later on.
3033892	3036174	This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?
3036641	3063268	it's because they do stupid shit because now everyone's like oh look look Project Rainfall worked no no they did it so they could save face so they're like see we care about the hardcore gamer buy the Wii U we're gonna put out hardcore games for it then you buy the Wii U and you're gonna get fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more Mario games oh and there's gonna be a Zelda there because you know that's a hardcore game now and maybe a Metroid that's gonna suck
3064568	3067130	I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting.
3067850	3073654	And RDGSinge in our chatroom says, The new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year.
3076236	3079238	I'm not sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you can read into it.
3079378	3083161	And it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games?
3083241	3086683	And I think you can, but certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about?
3086703	3087404	And I gotta say...
3088746	3091228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3112467	3114329	That was all anybody could talk about.
3114529	3115951	Nobody shared the stage.
3115991	3119555	That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good games.
3119735	3124320	And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever, and some other good Wii games.
3125401	3132008	But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or sold their Wii because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to play anymore.
3132189	3132949	Where is my Wii?
3133670	3135471	You know, so it's like, well, who cares?
3135771	3138231	And also, Skyward Sword, one system.
3138531	3140712	Skyrim, on a bunch of systems and PCs.
3141112	3143913	So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking about it.
3143933	3146174	But once again, RPG, adventure game.
3146554	3147014	Different.
3147194	3147654	Completely different.
3147694	3149214	Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.
3149234	3150415	Yeah, it's definitely not for Grandma.
3151195	3154056	I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal to a lot of people.
3154176	3159317	And to be honest, I mean, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind of a risky move for them.
3159377	3160518	I mean, if you think about it, they're...
3162139	3168657	Their big thing was let's get non-gamers into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.
3169895	3170575	Yeah, but there's a problem.
3170595	3171836	They were non-gamers for a reason.
3171896	3172996	They don't play games.
3173736	3183639	And yeah, they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii Party didn't sell very well because no one buys games that are non-gamers.
3185360	3193522	Mario may have sold well for some of the stuff because, once again, you're convincing them it's a party game, but Skyward Sword, not a party game, not really anything that non-gamers are going to be interested in.
3193542	3194603	It is kind of...
3195583	3207741	Hey fans of the series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey we're still considering you and it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform but
3209164	3216431	At the same time, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever, I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care.
3216451	3217031	I'm not going to buy it.
3217752	3220574	Especially when they said GameStop only, I'm really not going to buy it.
3221415	3222176	I gotta be honest.
3222456	3226640	Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April.
3226660	3228782	I am leaning towards, I think I might buy it.
3230484	3236926	It's a good game at the end of the day despite my displeasure of how they're fucking this up.
3237607	3249331	I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein that DarkSakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on.
3249391	3253773	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a piece of gaming history.
3253953	3255974	We have almost everything that Working Designs put out.
3257054	3257515	Same thing.
3257535	3258776	It's kind of one of those things for me.
3280834	3288398	and yeah, I don't give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. They'll use probably the touchpad for some other goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for.
3288498	3288878	Whatever.
3288898	3289659	I don't care.
3290299	3297402	Yeah, I may get in on 3DS, but I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that has all these classic tracks.
3297763	3299904	What if the Mario game is really good?
3300304	3303085	Like Mario 3DS Land or whatever the hell it's called.
3303125	3304106	Super Mario 3D Land.
3304526	3305466	Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo
3324429	3351079	and a lot of games have sold me the systems you know Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation but and there's a lot of Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation there was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii but you know what I bought the Wii and I played some of those games and haven't really touched it since played a little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back but I mean I kind of was like it's kind of a waste of my money
3351886	3368919	And I don't want to make that mistake again Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on But I'm sure we'll get lots of emails on it this week Oh wait, you can't email us Actually no, the email should be fixed mid-week So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, we've got more news to cover So I'm going to go back to Loki
3369594	3384704	Alright, so let's see here, let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool, and I actually had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind of reinvigorated it.
3384764	3399314	There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which I'm not too familiar with those games,
3399534	3402656	Because they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.
3428655	3433398	But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware.
3433818	3446567	And EA, I guess they've given, they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high quality RPG titles to a fast growing, highly engaged core gamer crowd.
3447268	3454693	And they're also saying, you know, planning on bringing stuff to, you know, social platforms like Facebook and stuff.
3454973	3457295	So maybe seeing like Bioware games on Facebook and stuff.
3457295	3460577	Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there.
3460597	3463538	Well, I've been seeing it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook, too.
3463658	3465639	Yeah, so more like that type of game.
3465719	3470421	Because that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.
3471222	3472803	And so it's BioWare Sacramento now.
3472823	3473303	That's kind of cool.
3473803	3477886	Yeah, because that's where we, if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered is in Sacramento.
3478727	3480948	I did a little investigative journalism, if you will.
3481008	3482509	I just want to figure out where these guys are located.
3482549	3485171	I want to know if they were downtown or if they were like a suburb.
3485511	3487172	Well, do you know where they are downtown?
3487493	3488553	I found this fascinating.
3488573	3493757	I actually, because their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is.
3493797	3495558	And so I Googled it and put it in the maps.
3496018	3497840	Guess what they are next door to?
3500871	3506232	The Depot Oh, fun Do you know what The Depot is, our international audience?
3507393	3522756	It's the gay bar downtown The gay bar It's right at the corner of where all the gay bars are down there I think it's hilarious, Bioware Sacramento Bioware is now officially next door to a gay bar
3524817	3526058	It's just whatever.
3526238	3535945	But it's just kind of funny because, you know, especially BioWare has also been kind of one of the leading companies in kind of breaking down that barrier in a lot of their storytelling, too.
3536026	3539108	You know, obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff.
3539548	3541570	Alan's tried and they've got positions on the website.
3541590	3543071	And I think a lot of it's like design stuff, too.
3543131	3543832	So you really should.
3544732	3545493	You should look into that.
3545953	3547535	So, in fact, we should...
3548235	3551237	Gosh, now there's gaming companies starting to pop up here.
3551297	3552318	There's us.
3553539	3555000	There's BioWare Sacramento.
3555260	3559143	There's the Prima Games people are actually here too, the strategy guys that come out of there.
3559523	3561805	We need to have a luncheon.
3563326	3564467	Maybe a short luncheon.
3565308	3566388	Hi, two people.
3567449	3572573	We need to rent out the back room at the Spaghetti Factory, which is across the street from BioWare Sacramento.
3574051	3575652	Sacramento's not on the website yet.
3576153	3577514	No, but go to their old name.
3577914	3579856	The ClickNation or whatever, it's on there.
3579916	3581057	But a lot of that's probably changed.
3581277	3582037	Oh, yeah.
3582278	3585440	I applied with them before as ClickNation.
3585500	3585780	Yeah, yeah.
3587639	3588199	There you go.
3588599	3590920	A little more gaming moving into our backyard.
3590940	3591560	That's pretty cool.
3592000	3592601	All said and done.
3593221	3593801	Good luck to them.
3593841	3601904	I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but especially with... Here's where I could see this going.
3601944	3606025	A lot of people are very excited about The Old Republic, which Bioware is a part of.
3606565	3613447	If they can find the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think they'll be a step ahead of Warcraft.
3613527	3614548	Because World of Warcraft...
3615228	3619033	Yeah, they've kind of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great.
3619053	3621677	They just kind of publish like, hey, my character got this achievement.
3621737	3623439	And hey, look at this 3D model of my character.
3623459	3625441	And it always seems to break whenever there's a new patch.
3625962	3630148	So, you know, Blizzard has not been interfacing with Facebook very well.
3630228	3633492	So this is a chance where BioWare could maybe get a step up.
3634116	3636237	So who knows if these will be the guys to do it or not.
3637398	3638058	So pretty cool.
3638839	3639959	Fun stuff going on in the backyard.
3640680	3640960	All right.
3641821	3642281	Moving on.
3642801	3646043	Lots of reports coming out of Black Friday sales.
3646083	3650025	Of course, Black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.
3650085	3653708	because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day.
3653748	3655188	And now some of the sales numbers are in.
3655589	3655989	Apparently...
3657845	3661147	and Loki will love this following up with the rants he was just saying there.
3661568	3670194	Nintendo of America in an interview with USA Today mentioned that Super Mario 3D Land has become the fastest selling portable Mario game ever.
3671055	3673377	Mario Land on the Game Boy Mario Advance
3689933	3692535	So whatever, it is the fastest selling game ever.
3692775	3696057	It moved half a million copies since November 13th.
3696997	3699759	3DS system sales are up, way up too.
3700119	3702401	System sales up 325% for the week of November 20th.
3702441	3706183	Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.
3708720	3711523	The Wii had its biggest Black Friday ever.
3711903	3715427	Half a million systems sold on Black Friday alone.
3715967	3719291	They needed that because they were not selling well at all.
3719531	3722914	The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, 535,000 copies, fastest selling Zelda in history.
3727950	3728450	There you go.
3729031	3731212	Lots of stuff coming out of Nintendo.
3731272	3733153	Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too.
3733493	3738836	They moved almost a million Xbox 360s on the week of Black Friday.
3738896	3742038	They don't say specifically Black Friday, but like just under a million 360s.
3742058	3743579	750,000 connects that same week.
3747861	3750563	I'm kind of surprised that the Kinect had such a huge year.
3750943	3754606	There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on at the Kinect right now, except maybe like Dance Central 2 is cool.
3754626	3756587	There's a lot of games out for the Kinect, though.
3756907	3758068	A lot of games out.
3758889	3759329	A lot of garbage.
3759349	3762111	Not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are out.
3762311	3763072	But there's some good stuff.
3763112	3772518	I had a giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox website because they're like, Kinect for core, like as in hardcore gamers, and they have like a picture of Forza on there.
3772538	3777101	I'm like, because it has head tracking, it has some voice commands, that's hardly a Kinect game.
3777901	3804387	and Just Dance 3 which is a Kinect game but this is a franchise that was really popular on the Wii between November 20th and 26th Just Dance 3 sold 700,000 copies lots ABBA You Can Dance no sales figures on that just right now but I'm telling you I didn't talk about that game the other week it's fabulous
3805257	3805898	Oh, Rob.
3806258	3809480	DarkSakura watched me play Abba, You Can Dance on the Wii.
3809500	3809900	I did.
3809980	3812262	It was the gayest thing I've ever seen.
3813963	3815884	There was a song where- It's really something.
3816204	3817766	There was a song where- You gotta see it.
3817846	3818226	You gotta see it.
3818246	3819066	They have a ballerina.
3819347	3819507	Yeah.
3820027	3821688	And Rob was trying to go in point.
3821988	3828112	You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs, and it has a little ballerina on the screen, so you have to do little ballerina dances.
3828273	3829173	It's hilarious.
3829193	3829834	Wasn't that Fernando?
3830454	3832055	I think it was The Winner Takes It All or something.
3832175	3833096	It was Fernando.
3833196	3833476	Maybe.
3834056	3834357	I don't know.
3834377	3834657	Whatever.
3836458	3838219	No, it's The Winter Takes It All, I think.
3838299	3839599	That was it.
3841120	3843861	That was when we had to do the hand sweepy thing.
3844402	3844782	Yeah.
3846463	3846723	Anyhow.
3848435	3850677	I have blurry photos of Rob.
3851638	3853319	I have blurry photos of Rob.
3854320	3856062	That better not end up on the internet.
3856142	3856942	I will destroy you.
3857082	3859024	I'm going to call you Dance Squatch.
3860405	3862827	You know, because every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.
3863027	3863308	Shush.
3863628	3865629	Alright, let's move on with some release dates.
3865649	3872175	We're going to travel around the world and check out games coming out soon, although it's probably dried up quite a bit moving past Black Friday now.
3872818	3876042	Yeah, it's usually December is quite a dead month.
3876102	3882349	In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are probably going to be just a couple titles.
3882850	3886935	But this week we had Mario Kart 7, well today, that's on the 3DS.
3887375	3890158	Fortune Street coming out on the Wii this week.
3890519	3892421	Jaws Ultimate Predator on the Wii and 3DS.
3893562	3908029	FaceRacer's photo finish on the 3DS NanoAssault on the 3DS Ubisoft is releasing their own tablet thing to compete with UDraw the Drawsome tablet that's coming out on the Wii
3908929	3911070	Yeah, it's awesome.
3912751	3916933	Outdoors Unleashed, Africa and Alaska coming out on 3DS.
3919234	3923656	Just Dance 3 on the PlayStation 3, finally coming out for the PlayStation Move.
3924256	3929459	The Adventures of Tintin, the game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and the 3DS.
3930719	3956669	I care about 1010 You know the game will be garbage The game doesn't look like garbage It's actually kind of a neat little adventure game I don't know what I'm talking about Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait Interruption Amiga 777 says it's been reported that Famitsu confirmed a Kinect remake of Blue Stinger Ooh Okay Formula 1 2011 for the 3DS The Oregon Trail for the Wii and 3DS this week
3960256	3962880	Hell yeah.
3964262	3965944	I think my Wii died of dysentery.
3967640	3968800	Actually, I think that's why I haven't played it.
3968820	3969620	And I believe that is it.
3970161	3975502	Alright, then let's move on to Japan and talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there.
3976082	3984444	This week on December the 8th on the Xbox 360, Dragon Ball Z, Ultimate Blast, Connect Disneyland Adventures, Michael Jackson The Experience.
3984504	3988585	Boy, that game's been out here a while, but you're finally getting it in Japan this week in regular and limited editions.
3988865	3992966	And the Elder Scrolls Skyrim comes out in Japan this week.
3993126	3994346	I can't imagine...
3995006	4000808	They've localized everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the menus and things.
4000948	4003029	I don't know, but that's interesting.
4003069	4004249	They are bringing that out in Japan.
4005810	4008271	By the way, next week, huge release, Final Fantasy XIII 2.
4008331	4009531	This is Japan, again.
4010171	4012052	I know we're getting it early next year.
4012572	4025817	PlayStation 3 on December the 8th, Beyond the Future Fix, The Time Arrow in regular and limited edition, Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Blast, Michael Jackson The Experience, Need for Speed The Run, Japan's edition, as well as the Elder Scrolls Skyrim there as well.
4025837	4028999	They actually did all the voice acting stuff in Japanese.
4029039	4029799	Did they really?
4030019	4030259	Yeah.
4030279	4031059	That's a lot.
4031079	4033981	They have a trailer that shows it.
4034021	4037382	I think it was on Kotaku they were saying, which language trailer is the most epic?
4040223	4047331	and they had Japanese and German and French and a whole bunch of stuff.
4049133	4050874	I'm searching the YouTubes right now.
4050934	4051275	Let's see.
4051315	4053978	The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Japan trailer.
4054038	4055719	I better not get trolled with this YouTube link.
4055760	4056120	Let's see.
4056741	4057822	We are live, folks.
4057962	4058342	Let's see.
4058362	4061926	If the world has come to an end, let's enjoy it.
4074855	4075776	I'm feeling moved already.
4075796	4076497	I don't know about you guys.
4076517	4077779	There's not a lot of talking.
4094625	4096185	God, this game is really good.
4096265	4099066	I actually do have to say that that's an example of the Japanese voice acting.
4099106	4099966	It sounds really good.
4099986	4103787	They could be reading this in pig Latin and I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic!
4121707	4123188	Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire thing, but there you go.
4123208	4126429	Wow, I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.
4126569	4127470	So props to them.
4127510	4129030	That's really something else.
4129791	4134673	All right, also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Wizardry Perfect Pack comes out this week.
4134733	4136313	That's a role-playing game.
4136353	4139295	I wonder if that ties into the old-ass Wizardry series from back in the day.
4139355	4139875	It probably does.
4141416	4141776	Let's see.
4142016	4144997	On other systems, the PlayStation Vita, not out just yet.
4145037	4145778	That is December 17th.
4146958	4149299	But otherwise, anything on the Wii this week?
4149659	4169985	Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games And Michael Jackson The Experience and Need for Speed The Run All the versions on the Wii are out this week as well Let me check the 3DS lastly real quick Ah, World Soccer Winning 11 2012 Soccer games are usually pretty big over there And, looks like on a special release day, the 10th of December This might be slightly a big deal Monster Hunter 3G
4171496	4184925	That's right, the Monster Hunter 3DS game is out People are going to be piled outside waiting for it Yep, that's slightly a big deal Side of people who will be in line Yeah Freaking Monster Hunter Alright Two games in the UK Alright, what?
4185886	4193051	On the 9th, Dizzy Prince of Yolk Folk on the iPhone and Android And Just Dance 3 for PlayStation 3 There you go
4194814	4197035	DarkSakura, more gaming news please.
4197676	4201397	Well, I don't know if Alan knows about this.
4201738	4202138	He does.
4202518	4203458	I trolled him with it already.
4204499	4208661	Well, a Valve employee was spotted wearing a Half-Life 3 shirt.
4209982	4212863	And the person that took the picture, Chandana...
4214372	4219839	and Ekenayake, I think that's how it's pronounced, asked permission to take the picture too and put it on his Twitter.
4221101	4226167	So it's a big Half-Life logo with the three.
4226447	4226688	Yeah.
4227318	4228338	Thanks for watching!
4245444	4250087	This whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling, but I hope it's true.
4250788	4257392	I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true, but the problem is it could also be a joke.
4259253	4263115	I mean, is this something that Valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce?
4263535	4267878	They probably would want to show off the new engine, obviously, because it would be a new engine.
4268158	4269579	I'd imagine so.
4269739	4272202	I guess if it's real, maybe something early next year?
4272222	4274784	Because, you know, what else is Valve working on right now that we know of?
4274865	4275545	The Dota game.
4275565	4276787	That's about Dota 2 or whatever.
4276807	4278889	I'm going to put the picture up on our Tumblr.
4279489	4279770	All right.
4281151	4285636	And Salacious Popper, Alan, is in our chat right now saying, shaking and crying, shaking and crying.
4287011	4287531	I'm there with you.
4287592	4288352	I hope it's true.
4289593	4290554	A lot of people will be very happy.
4290574	4291995	If it's true, then I'll need new underwear.
4292256	4292556	All right.
4294297	4295879	Valve, try to give us all a little bit of warning.
4296779	4297060	All right.
4298381	4298661	Loki.
4299982	4301183	All right.
4301784	4302664	So let's see here.
4303385	4307549	This is kind of annoying, I guess.
4308429	4311392	You remember how some of these publishers are doing online passes?
4311432	4313013	Well, EA, being the...
4313914	4314735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4330111	4330611	That's right.
4330932	4347761	Apparently, there is a guy that was part of the Neo Games Are Fun forum, and he posted that his copy of EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit contained the online pass that was expired, blocking him from accessing online content.
4348702	4352784	And I guess there's a bunch of other people that were saying that they ran into the same problem.
4354822	4368667	EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly.
4370249	4373754	Dragon Age 2 has an online pass that expires March 31, 2012.
4385930	4391331	Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement, it's actually listed in there.
4391351	4394852	It says redownloading or getting a new pass is free.
4395332	4403834	EA said, I'm not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the old pass and it somehow changes the date or something.
4404794	4408495	Um, and it's weird though, that they have,
4409963	4410363	Wait for it?
4410463	4411024	Wait for it?
4411044	4412364	Do I really need to say anything else?
4412424	4412585	I mean...
4438160	4442663	Yeah, I just don't understand why they would do that in the first place.
4443283	4452048	I mean, that would be like, for example, if you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically these passes act like download content, and it expires.
4452989	4453329	Hey!
4453909	4456811	Hey, you know you like playing that Skyrim DLC.
4457592	4461034	Hope you finished all your quests in it, because it's expired.
4463495	4464876	Unfortunately, we made it out of meat.
4468151	4469192	It's no good anymore.
4470012	4471894	You can't consume this download content.
4472575	4473475	You will get sick.
4477839	4482723	I mean, it's just... I know, I know.
4484784	4486025	What else needs to be said?
4486085	4493151	It's just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting punished over and over again.
4493431	4495313	And it's like, when is this shit going to stop?
4496511	4525264	oh and they even said that apparently Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and it even says on the actual card it says was it the service network whatever activation and it says code expires January 1st 2012 so if you're planning on buying Mass Effect 2 I hope you use that code already SMH that's all I have to say SMH
4527512	4527972	Moving on.
4529093	4530314	You know, wait, no, not moving on.
4530354	4551850	You know, in California, we have this law, and I think some other states have it too, and the federal has certain protections about it, but if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate to the movie theater for his birthday, and he never uses it, but like three years later he finds it, it's still worth $25.
4551910	4552750	They can't deduct fees, so...
4555412	4582792	if he wants to take it in for certain amounts I think it's like up to $10 or $25 he can actually go in and say I want the cash back then they have to give him the money for it like they have to do that so it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole kind of around this where things that are worth money like this can expire I'm going to tell you something else though in the state of California gift cards don't expire oh yeah yeah
4584477	4585818	So why does this stuff expire?
4586978	4589019	I don't think it actually legally would be able to in this state.
4589559	4591720	See, but it's not real money.
4592380	4594320	The online pass technically has no value.
4594921	4595761	It does and it doesn't.
4596321	4597442	To me, it seems like a legal loophole.
4597462	4600543	The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it.
4601563	4603024	But you've still bought the pass.
4603744	4605184	You've still bought the card.
4605644	4607465	But you didn't really buy the pass.
4607705	4609866	It was included with your new game.
4610542	4612624	It still has a monetary value attached to it.
4612644	4615547	The game has a monetary value.
4615567	4617929	No, the pass actually does have a monetary value.
4617949	4619650	But you didn't buy the pass, you bought the game.
4621171	4621772	I don't agree.
4621892	4623153	I don't agree with what I'm saying.
4623273	4624334	I'm just being their lawyer.
4624414	4626396	No, but it's nothing that would stand.
4627498	4628079	Thanks for watching!
4648900	4669242	Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these online passes that you happen to throw in their way guess what you can download any DLC for free now granted if you know Mass Effect 2 or whatever that's not a big deal and you can't play online with you know a JTAG system or something like that but you can download all that download content
4669622	4671023	For example, Saints Row the Third.
4671443	4684408	If you're ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend that may have a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version of that online pass download content that works just fine.
4684828	4690671	Of course, legitimate consumers that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what?
4690931	4696193	THQ wants to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares.
4696813	4702014	or they can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle.
4702034	4705095	It's just a little minor inconvenience, I guess.
4705815	4707936	I mean, and does it stop some used game sales?
4708356	4708896	Maybe it does.
4709296	4717938	I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like that.
4718398	4718779	It's not the way.
4718799	4720499	The sequel to Tiny Tower, tiny text.
4721284	4722544	It's not the way to go about it.
4722804	4732207	I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January.
4732367	4734307	Let's say they go and buy it in January and they got this code.
4734347	4736328	Hey, sweet, I can get this free download content.
4736848	4738248	And you go put in code invalid.
4738749	4739269	It's expired.
4740629	4746413	I mean, wouldn't that kind of leave a little sour taste in your mouth once you think twice before buying an EA product again?
4746774	4747654	And let's just say they bought it.
4748375	4748815	Brand new.
4748915	4751337	Because, I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.
4751457	4756481	Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet, and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.
4757822	4759884	I mean, that would kind of annoy me.
4760164	4763106	That would be like, maybe... What?
4764067	4766769	You should have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier!
4766929	4768210	I mean, thanks!
4771976	4784166	What I think it comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of when they're going to drop prices of these things, and you see they work in the price of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60.
4784546	4788569	Oh, now we're going to drop it down to $20, and we're going to take the download vote.
4788790	4790691	No, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually.
4790831	4792913	I think you're giving them too much credit to plan ahead.
4792933	4795695	I think that's exactly what happened here, is that people didn't plan ahead.
4795875	4797837	And I think that's what's really happening here, is this...
4798297	4803159	Somebody put the cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well, what about when these things expire?
4803179	4805380	And then when that point came up, somebody just said, ah, fuck them.
4807300	4809221	So that's what happens in boardrooms across America.
4809541	4809881	Fuck them!
4812442	4812962	Moving on.
4814763	4815323	Verizon.
4815663	4816804	I wanted to say fuck them too.
4818462	4822526	Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon, but if not, well, fuck them too.
4822586	4825989	But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about Verizon, because this sounds like it could be interesting.
4826670	4829513	You know that whole streaming TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360?
4829893	4833076	Well, Verizon Fios, I don't know what that is, because we don't have this here.
4833096	4835478	I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse, that type of thing?
4835498	4836159	It's F-I-O-S, it's...
4840279	4866916	FiberOptic Okay Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels from this to your Xbox 360 If you're an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get the Fios TV and Internet service So in other words, as long as you can just turn on your TV and get these channels Now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have Gold as well And you'll get 26 of the channels
4870458	4874121	I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome, but everybody's reporting on it anyway.
4875542	4882608	No, I'm with you, because as far as... Oh, you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect.
4882708	4883209	I don't care.
4883349	4884830	That's something your TV can't do.
4885731	4886712	Once again... Xbox!
4887072	4887833	P-break!
4889794	4892036	Once again, why do I need to do that?
4893277	4902224	Okay, I'm telling you, in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote faster than someone can say, pause.
4902825	4905147	I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference there.
4905307	4906808	Xbox, pause.
4907288	4908589	Did you ask for a puppy?
4909550	4911812	No, Xbox, pause.
4912252	4913753	You want to watch Jaws?
4915875	4917897	Xbox, pause!
4921127	4924429	It's just... Cannot identify you.
4924489	4925570	Please face sensor.
4928572	4931234	You're not old enough to watch this programming.
4934442	4936984	Uh, I mean, here's the thing.
4937204	4943848	I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for stuff in addition to my cable company.
4944048	4953634	Or, like, for example, say, if I'm ever so inclined to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point?
4953794	4956175	If I have to have cable to watch TV...
4957665	4958985	I'm going to do it without an Xbox.
4959105	4963646	I don't need to buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV.
4963966	4965007	Chat room to the rescue.
4965087	4966487	The show where every gamer has a voice.
4966787	4968847	Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this.
4968927	4970028	Alpha Kanatagram in the chat.
4970768	4977109	If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one.
4978289	4979249	Something for the kids room.
4981170	4982050	Loki, witty retort.
4984580	5003560	I can just get another box and okay that's great that's great we can do that I suppose but at the same time I mean I only watch TV in one room I don't need that what about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV in his room
5004744	5006885	Then he can watch TV in his room.
5007185	5010966	Because by then I'm sure we'll have something better than the Xbox streaming.
5011346	5016467	Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream cable, we got a problem.
5017308	5022349	I mean, hell, you can get like dish installed like four receivers or whatever.
5022629	5023769	I'm not going to do that.
5024650	5028471	Like they always say, but we can install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms.
5028491	5028751	I'm like...
5029672	5030453	I'm only one person.
5030493	5032537	I can watch TV in one room at a time.
5032638	5034161	I don't need four receivers.
5034842	5035464	Why am I going to watch?
5035965	5040434	Hey, wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.
5042776	5043236	You know what?
5044077	5044897	I have the internet.
5045778	5047039	Fuck receivers.
5047079	5048740	I'm already paying for a high-speed internet.
5048760	5050001	That's my DVR.
5050341	5053343	I can watch shit whenever I want on any system.
5053683	5057586	And I like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your iPod and stuff.
5057766	5062269	Well, first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small until you watch a TV show on my iPod.
5062710	5062910	But, um...
5063717	5064058	DarkSakura.com
5079257	5081198	Um, so they're of course not going to do that.
5081539	5086161	So, watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal.
5086241	5101930	Now, here's the thing though that would interest me, is if they're in HD, because I currently don't pay for the HD package, because I chose to go the, I was actually going to go the route of no cable, but they said, hey, for two dollars extra we can give you cable, and I'm like, okay, two bucks, I can do that.
5103131	5103751	Two dollars.
5106144	5133566	but it's actually the additional stuff on top of it like channels that are not on my TV that I'm interested in like if they have gaming channels or something like that ESPN Ocho the Ocho if they have additional stuff that's kind of what I'm interested in as far as the stuff that's offered from Verizon or Dish or DirecTV or whatever or maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently powered on how about that wouldn't that be something
5135526	5136026	You know what?
5137167	5137867	JD Ross.
5138287	5140088	JD Ross is not working.
5140428	5142789	Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.
5143589	5144210	Think about it.
5145450	5147311	Could be the Major Nelson hour.
5149752	5151112	Could be the Major Nelson channel.
5151673	5154013	Just camera fixed on Major Nelson all day long.
5154674	5156214	Major's miniseries, maybe.
5157395	5160176	DarkSakura, we need another news story, please.
5161522	5162323	Animal Crossing!
5163003	5165525	This one's actually kind of different.
5166666	5174670	Yeah, they say that now, but... You actually play as the mayor, and you can customize your town, and you have a secretary.
5174690	5175431	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5175651	5176812	Now I'm the mayor?
5177072	5177632	Now you're the mayor.
5177712	5179513	Do people have to do what I say?
5179794	5180334	Probably.
5180854	5182835	You also have a secretary named Shizu.
5184276	5203938	and the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently too and your clothes you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts so now that I'm the mayor will I be able to evict Tom Nook
5205080	5205641	I wish.
5205721	5207183	Will you have to deal with problems?
5207223	5210446	Will all the animals start occupying on your front lawn?
5211267	5213009	Is that going to happen?
5213310	5218215	Am I going to have to send out Resetti to mace the villagers of the town?
5219977	5221038	Can I finish my story, Rob?
5221098	5222160	I'm a hands-on mayor.
5222200	5223601	I'm going to take this shit in my own hand.
5223982	5224643	Grab the shovel!
5227135	5231197	Get the bug net and it's time to discipline people.
5231297	5235939	Can I finish feeding my story, Rob?
5235979	5236319	No.
5238120	5240041	Okay.
5240081	5241262	Rob's shaking and crying.
5241402	5242823	He's looking forward to this so much.
5243163	5247665	I just wish somebody other than Nintendo would make these games because then they might be really funny.
5249648	5250369	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5273088	5273288	Ooh.
5274749	5280731	And you can actually exchange house designs with people through street pass.
5282131	5284632	Like a model home view is what it is.
5284652	5285812	Oh, Loki, you know what this means.
5287453	5288933	You draw cocks on them.
5289953	5291734	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
5291794	5294135	Tom Nook has left his store.
5294675	5295655	He has a new job.
5296535	5298236	He's the town's real estate agent.
5300169	5302932	Tom Nook's a little asshole.
5306236	5308959	No wonder the housing market's screwed.
5309580	5312323	I just want Toto KK to be awesome in it forever.
5312383	5316028	Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over Animal Crossing.
5318155	5323398	Occupy Nooks I'm just like, really?
5323478	5347732	Fuck Nook, I'm switching to a credit union Hey, you can design your own couch cushions I don't fucking care Well, I'm looking, oh wow Actually, your little character looks a lot different I thought those real people were It's like, wow, that's realistic Some Japanese dude No, what's sad is they're trapped in your little town And they have to sing and dance for you to get out
5348325	5348765	DarkSakura.com
5364452	5366333	That's okay, we had a Japanese trailer earlier.
5366473	5367813	This can't possibly be any worse.
5367833	5370454	The people actually do look quite a bit different.
5370474	5371394	The little characters.
5371975	5373495	So this is the developer roundtable.
5373515	5374615	This is kind of boring.
5374635	5375416	When do we see the people?
5375436	5377076	It's like peppered throughout the video.
5393744	5398426	That video is about as exciting as Animal Crossing is on the second day.
5399427	5399787	Hey!
5400687	5403009	I'm probably gonna get it in a 3DS.
5405690	5407391	Let's move on, Loki.
5409862	5413764	Well, unfortunately, it is the end of GamePro.
5413984	5419265	They're going to cease publication altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly.
5420145	5421406	It will be their last issue.
5421926	5426747	And basically, the website is shutting down tomorrow on the 5th.
5427748	5429488	And they're done.
5430328	5430528	So...
5432389	5433750	Can I say something about that real quick?
5454728	5455649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5469465	5470386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5485865	5486365	Thanks for watching!
5513269	5518312	GamePro, yeah, you know, it was great back in the day when the internet wasn't around.
5518332	5532000	Unfortunately, now everything is digital and print magazines, unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store, then you're not going to do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives...
5533221	5537223	You really have to buy them or somehow leverage them out of these companies.
5537583	5544047	And most of the stuff that may be in your magazine is already a month old by the time everything rolls around.
5544087	5545047	It's tough.
5546388	5553332	You've got to figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time-sensitive material.
5553812	5555433	And that's tough because that's what people want.
5555513	5559595	That's why RetroGamer is a great magazine because you're not expecting to see new stuff in there.
5560616	5560796	Yeah.
5562435	5580389	Anyhow, interesting comment from GameGuru in the chatroom I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no gaming magazine besides PC Gamer My favorite magazine right now is actually Retro Gamer It's a British magazine that's all old video games Oh, the one I just mentioned?
5585080	5592088	Retro Gamer is a very, okay, and keep in mind, my career, what I want to make a career of is print publication.
5593669	5596773	And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort into it.
5597213	5599055	Print it on nice, glossy stock.
5600036	5604521	Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should warn you, it's going to be rough.
5607000	5619374	I gotta tell you guys about this gaming magazine that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games in there it's a magazine called Retro Gamer I don't know if you've heard of it shut up
5621909	5622669	Thank you for watching!
5638215	5642900	They're having a lot of overlap with their sister site, IndieGames.com.
5643160	5652549	And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of the best material out there as being indie related, they're just going to kind of focus mainly on IndieGames.com.
5652629	5661298	Also, mainstream game blogs are doing a much better job nowadays, including The Weirder and Alt Links and among the other gaming news.
5661798	5667042	Yeah, I think a lot of these gaming websites, to be honest, nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.
5667123	5668644	Oh, hey, one game blog covered it.
5668704	5669905	Let me cover it as well.
5671775	5675899	I mean, Kotaku, I read you daily.
5676559	5678161	And JoySick, you know.
5678901	5684967	Kotaku, I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny.
5686528	5690152	How many videos can I watch of someone spawning cheese and having to roll it down a hill?
5690192	5691833	I mean, yeah, it's funny the first time.
5691853	5692374	That's funny.
5692854	5695156	But I don't need to see that every single time.
5695817	5696838	But, you know, I...
5698619	5698959	I don't know.
5699239	5702761	Yeah, there's a lot of sites out there for getting your news.
5703241	5707663	Kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know, why we don't really cover a lot of the news.
5707723	5712545	Because, I mean, really, do you need another source for, you know, website news?
5712585	5713786	Well, no, we do talk about news.
5714086	5714566	Well, we do.
5714586	5715486	Just to have some lols.
5715867	5716567	To have some lols.
5716767	5724434	I mean, once again, it's all about, hey, we all have day jobs in our own lives and stuff.
5724514	5733241	Once again, we're not going to be there right away unless we have some sort of scoop on something, which is not very often because we're not doing this professionally.
5735383	5745592	that it's impossible for anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that.
5745812	5748535	We're just a few people and we just can't do it.
5751797	5752618	We concede.
5754439	5756081	Alright.
5756141	5756521	Moving on.
5756581	5763266	Since Loki talked about how much he sees Skyrim information oversaturating the internet, let's talk about Skyrim.
5763927	5767169	And Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out this week.
5767489	5769671	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
5769871	5770471	And apparently...
5771672	5772693	Oh, not doing too good.
5773093	5773893	It's kind of buggy.
5774413	5777514	A lot of users are reporting various issues are going on with the game.
5777775	5780316	Apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance.
5780396	5781296	That could be an issue.
5782456	5782957	Think about it.
5783197	5785758	Yeah, the bug list is quite funny actually down at the bottom there.
5786978	5787658	This here?
5787818	5788759	Unofficial bug list.
5788959	5789619	Oh, let me look at that.
5790059	5791440	Just mentioning some of the things.
5792140	5792981	Alright, let's look at this.
5793401	5796724	Oh, is this like, oh, somebody actually posted this on their own forums, good lord.
5796904	5799086	Well, it's actually the Bethesda forums.
5799366	5801408	Yeah, but this isn't Bethesda that posted this.
5801448	5802689	No, it's an unofficial list.
5802729	5803089	Yikes.
5804851	5810656	Let's see, the Dark Brotherhood Cal does not show a face mask, only seems to work for females, but doesn't show up for males.
5812777	5814699	Oh, where's the funny stuff?
5815520	5816881	Characters getting stuck running.
5819295	5822318	You know, obviously the resistance is not being there.
5823359	5824580	Dragons flying backwards.
5826301	5826902	Or erratic.
5827122	5829124	Destruction trainers are not letting me train.
5830385	5832607	Markarth guards always try to arrest the player.
5834789	5837351	Invisibility is being undone by the Shadow Warrior perk.
5839779	5847102	Oh, this is a funny one.
5847742	5854124	One of my coworkers was telling me about he was playing and I guess one of his followers died.
5854384	5855485	I think it might have been Lydia.
5856925	5862568	She's the first, well, not really the first follower, but the one you get appointed to by the Jarl.
5864309	5868130	So apparently she got smashed by a troll, no, a giant.
5868210	5869111	She got smashed by a giant.
5870111	5873613	Well, she didn't die, she kind of resurrected herself, but she was still flat.
5873993	5877354	And so she slithered around like a snake for about eight hours in-game.
5878075	5878175	And...
5879215	5907194	and then he was telling me also later on in the game like another person had died and so he's getting married or whatever and like everybody keeps like walking this is just an outrage this is disgusting this bride keeps like storming off and stuff like that he kept reloading and saying what the hell is going on I can't fucking understand what's going on looks down there's the corpse from the person that died like days ago this is like somehow teleported to your wedding he wanted to come see it that's hilarious
5907654	5908235	Patches in the future
5929545	5939521	My friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a dead monk in a jail cell, except he looked like he was spasming all over the place.
5940362	5942664	All right, LOL, Skyrim's buggy, we get it.
5942744	5945646	Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy.
5945666	5949509	I mean, as great as a game as Skyrim is, jeez, it's kind of buggy.
5950030	5953453	And, you know, we didn't... Remember when they couldn't patch games?
5953633	5955895	Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?
5956335	5957095	Oh, you mean like on the Wii?
5957676	5961199	And if you were gonna patch them, you just released a new game.
5963089	5965611	We're going to take a step back to simpler times.
5965671	5968873	Maybe it's a Wii game this week apparently since now that's a classic gaming system.
5969013	5970053	It's not a Wii game.
5970093	5972055	It's a classic game of the week.
5975417	5982021	The classic game is a game that I've actually done the full version of before but I haven't done this specifically.
5982521	5983862	So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas Nights.
5985283	5986544	My family tradition, damn it.
5988215	5997598	So, basically, you fly around, collect balls, put them in the idea cap machine, and go fight a boss.
5998138	5998378	Yay.
5999978	6000238	What?
6000999	6007840	Nothing, just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees that put the balls in for the family guy jokes.
6007880	6008521	I never saw it.
6011740	6018825	Anyway, with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December 1996 in Japan.
6018885	6020687	It came with the Christmas Saturn bundle.
6021647	6032515	Everywhere else, it was given away with the purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Raid Heroes, and Next Generation Magazine.
6033796	6033876	Um...
6035557	6042102	It actually, though, if you got the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't have a slipcover.
6042662	6044103	It just had a transparent one.
6044723	6046384	But it has its own little special cover.
6046484	6048606	In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this.
6049026	6051107	It got its own jewel case and everything.
6051808	6052228	Sucks.
6053469	6058552	So with this one, it has the full version of one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley.
6059453	6061494	But both Claris and Elliot can play through it.
6062194	6064136	Elliot couldn't in the full game.
6064796	6066538	And he has a different layout than Clarissa's one.
6066578	6067579	His is actually a little harder.
6068340	6077150	So basically, the way the story goes is that they notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in the center of town.
6077270	6081415	So they go into Nightopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.
6083300	6090806	At any rate, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it.
6091567	6096371	In November and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition.
6096631	6100254	Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition, but it changed to Winter Nights.
6100995	6102896	In December, it becomes Christmas Nights.
6104598	6117770	and then the entire area that you go through instead of being all spring-timey turns into wintery places and the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.
6119252	6122154	You have presents everywhere.
6122194	6125397	The music, as you can hear, is like a different version of Jingle Bells.
6125658	6126699	Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?
6133603	6135265	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6153963	6155404	and it's really fun and cool.
6155464	6168751	Now the other neat stuff that happens is that the weather in Spring Valley will change depending on the hour and then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's Day where instead of playing Knights you play as Vialla which is pretty cool.
6169511	6173593	It also has a ton of hidden goodies in it like one of the things that we unlocked last night
6174399	6176061	Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams
6195100	6201848	and you fight a bouncy ball version of Robotnik slash Eggman.
6202229	6209538	And the music is a remix version of Final Fever which was the final boss music from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD.
6209658	6212722	As I'm sure I've mentioned before, they changed the US music.
6213323	6214244	So it's really neat.
6214324	6216845	It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.
6217685	6221207	There's even a karaoke mode so you can sing the little theme song.
6221648	6222628	It's really fun.
6223449	6225410	It was a freebie, which was even better.
6227211	6230552	This is back in the day when they would do nice shit for us.
6230592	6231553	Don't you remember?
6233194	6233474	I do.
6234415	6236796	So that's your classic game is Christmas Nights.
6237813	6239415	Ho, ho, ho.
6240136	6240496	There it is.
6240516	6241597	There you go.
6241617	6242018	Yeah.
6242038	6242859	Christmas night.
6251820	6253061	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6253541	6254922	So time appropriate.
6255163	6256023	I appreciate that.
6256404	6260427	We're going to take a quick break, guys, but when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6260527	6265410	We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced this past week that's going to be lulzy.
6266331	6267852	A special email bag.
6268032	6270474	Somebody managed to get an email in anyway, even though the email's down.
6270494	6271835	We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.
6272076	6274277	And another game going free to play.
6274297	6278921	We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6284611	6287052	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6287092	6293935	We are live on this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show.
6294575	6298016	This show's been going on a long time, I just want to point out.
6298056	6300637	Every time you say the 37th, I want to go in a row.
6301858	6308260	So during the break, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays.
6308761	6311442	And some folks were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas?
6312122	6312582	DarkSakura.com
6325569	6344326	and then we'd go to family stuff to eat free food and we're doing stuff with now Alan and I are doing stuff with Alan's side of the family but I don't know when that'll be done we might be done by I seem to remember last year we were kind of out of there by like 4 or 5 so we'll see but I don't want to rush it so I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not probably
6344346	6348190	Probably not, but never say never, right?
6348390	6351152	I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and eat it live on air.
6351412	6355156	It would be fun to do, have a Chinese food Christmas special, but we'll see.
6356537	6361021	Anyhow, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not, you guys.
6361802	6366887	The good news is the next week should be easy, so we'll have one week off for the holidays, and that should be it.
6368628	6375353	We'll let you know more about that in the next couple weeks Because believe it or not, Christmas is only about three weeks away from today So, yikes!
6376294	6380497	Alright, Jester Scott in our chatroom says Take a day off, peeps!
6381878	6385841	That's true, we deserve a day off That's what we're getting for the holidays, a day off Let's go to Disneyland
6387349	6388090	Don't even tempt me.
6388671	6388971	All right.
6389992	6392035	We're going to get back into some more gaming news.
6392436	6395019	Your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets.
6395059	6399965	Make sure you get your tweets in because especially since the email bag's been down this week, we're really relying on your tweets.
6400005	6402028	So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
6402308	6403810	We don't have quite as much news.
6404471	6409354	This half of the show, as we did in the first half of the show, so we definitely need your calls and tweets tonight.
6410955	6412596	Do we have a work injury?
6412676	6413136	What's going on?
6413196	6414637	DarkSakura says she has a splinter.
6414657	6415317	Go take care of it!
6415397	6416018	I have a splinter!
6416258	6418319	Alright, go do what you need to do.
6418699	6419660	Loki will read some news.
6420080	6420740	We'll take care of it.
6421241	6422641	Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.
6422801	6423822	I'll do the news, I guess.
6425083	6426984	So let's talk a little bit about...
6428621	6429061	Zynga.
6429601	6440144	And apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of a franchise with Angry Birds in it.
6440744	6448786	Apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for a $2.25 billion acquisition from Zynga.
6449766	6452467	So that's a lot of pride right there.
6453871	6454832	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6485531	6491336	Tell us about that role-playing game that's coming out very soon.
6494358	6496699	If you can load up the story here, if it'll work.
6497960	6498481	All right.
6499662	6500582	Sweet.
6500782	6503284	Let's talk a little bit about... This is great.
6503965	6504545	South Park.
6505326	6512251	They've had a lot of okay games, and then, of course, they have to go and...
6514071	6515552	and DarkSakura's bleeding, apparently.
6516352	6520713	No, um... And now it's come out... I was gonna say something nasty, but I didn't.
6521514	6524995	Thank God, I... I appreciate that you did not say anything.
6525075	6528036	I was gonna take it there, and then I said, you know what, I'm not gonna take it there.
6528876	6531137	That would explain a lot about why she's so upset.
6533524	6534724	Rob, you know what?
6534824	6537585	I know that Alan would really like for you to come home eventually.
6537605	6538746	South Park, you were saying?
6539046	6539726	Yeah, South Park.
6539746	6548030	Well, they have an Xbox Live Arcade game, the kind of side-scroller co-op game that's South Park's Tenement's Revenge, which is coming out a little bit later on.
6548071	6549111	But this isn't what we're talking about.
6549131	6552593	We're talking about what was revealed from the new cover of Game Informer.
6552893	6556455	Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company that can get exclusives.
6557555	6558315	We'll see you next time.
6582563	6588505	Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
6589485	6594407	And, uh, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they also have, uh, some details out about it.
6595027	6601449	Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about you fitting in, I guess.
6601949	6605630	And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be completely customizable.
6606310	6610111	Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff like that.
6610952	6611072	Um...
6612672	6616195	and I think it's pretty awesome looking.
6616235	6618276	They're saying it's going to combine a bunch of different things.
6618596	6620778	The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.
6621819	6628183	The weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from 7.
6630204	6636509	Also, they're saying that, of course, the entire game is going to be 2D or at least look hand-drawn, I guess.
6637489	6641993	I gotta say, I'm a little worried, though, because the other South Park games that have come out today have been kind of crappy.
6642094	6644035	Granted, this is a new company doing this.
6644095	6646057	Like, who did the Nintendo 64 one?
6646077	6647899	That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it?
6647919	6649701	And that one, that was that first-person shooter.
6649721	6650642	It really wasn't that good.
6651122	6658029	So, I mean, you know, there's been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live Arcade games, like, you know, there's the Let's Play Tower Defense and all that stuff.
6658109	6659050	It's good that it has their input.
6659070	6659150	Yes.
6687266	6687587	I don't know.
6687607	6688089	I'm excited.
6688109	6689092	I'd buy it.
6692051	6692751	I'll definitely check that out.
6692791	6695172	I mean, you know, the demo and so forth is very important.
6695192	6700434	But it's so funny that South Park is still going after all these years.
6700454	6701714	I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons, too.
6701774	6702994	God, The Simpsons has been on forever.
6703014	6703975	The Simpsons is still going.
6704435	6709096	But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of college.
6710016	6710877	That was, what, 97?
6711357	6712357	And it's still on the air?
6713518	6716278	And people talk about, boy, South Park is so old.
6716558	6717819	Which means I'm so old.
6718599	6721182	Rob, I'm older than you.
6721542	6722923	I was talking about Kinect for PC.
6743083	6748545	I think so, but I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week, so here's the deal.
6748685	6757527	Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect, and Kinect 2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected, right?
6757987	6763269	More high-def cameras, all you really need, and maybe a better microphone in there, I don't know, or higher sound sampling.
6763789	6774952	but apparently it's going to have some other technical stuff in it as well it's going to be able to read lips it will be able to detect the direction that you're facing and recognize your emotional state
6776323	6776643	DarkSakura.com
6794241	6796444	Well, look, a lot of this is just what?
6796524	6799468	A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device.
6799989	6803995	The fact that it would be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising.
6804035	6808060	It was stuff that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough camera resolution.
6808080	6808701	It didn't have the power!
6810083	6810183	Hmm.
6810223	6810303	Hmm.
6835871	6861557	you know the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing I mean especially for what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth or folks you know that it's going to be really neat I think kind of like it's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now like when they showed FaceTime for the first time and how like deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of like have phone calls so it's pretty awesome so it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up in that regard that's cool yeah very cool
6862978	6867546	It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.
6870769	6872791	All right, we're going to go to our email bag.
6872871	6873972	Now, here's the thing.
6874232	6879196	We don't really have a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week.
6879356	6885121	I would say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6885621	6893607	However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, hordehouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning.
6893988	6899072	And one of our special guests, all the way from the other side of the pond, Sil, beat me on Skype and said...
6899608	6900028	DarkSakura.com
6923195	6925037	Oh shit, that's right, you need mailbag music.
6925718	6927860	We also love Syl and we'll do whatever she wants.
6927961	6929502	I mean really at the end of the day, right?
6930123	6931084	Syl is my hero.
6931104	6931665	That's right.
6937518	6937898	Email!
6939079	6939559	Hello, guys.
6940440	6944983	I'm so sorry for what happened to the website, and I hope it will all be resolved quickly.
6945703	6953048	Now, I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet, but it seriously made me facepalm, and I'm not even giving anybody the address because it's retarded.
6953848	6955229	It's called Mario Kills Tanuki.
6955269	6956330	It's on the PETA website.
6956350	6958671	If you really want to find it, find it, but I don't care.
6958732	6965196	It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving, so I think a lot of people heard of this.
6966636	6977540	I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end, points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our inner beings and morals.
6977900	6983302	I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game I never felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat.
6984083	6985803	What is your feeling about what PETA did here?
6986263	6991705	I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing up Shermie now and taking measurements.
6992185	6993146	Then I haven't said anything.
6993766	6994768	Love the show, Zil.
6994788	6995790	I love Zil.
6995810	6997093	First of all, Shermie...
6999602	7001584	What the hell is that ringtone?
7002384	7006268	My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is Bitches by Mindless Self-Indulgence.
7006408	7006928	Okay.
7008369	7010411	Apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now.
7016316	7019138	First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.
7019639	7021000	It's a bullshit organization.
7021500	7027926	They put more animals to sleep, or I should just say they murder more animals than they help.
7029433	7044418	Their second in command, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, their second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal-derived insulin.
7045139	7045639	Just saying.
7046659	7055102	Their main leader is a sociopath who basically has stated that she would rather all humanity die.
7057032	7059273	and have the world ruled by animals.
7059873	7060993	So I'm just throwing that out there.
7061434	7061974	She's crazy.
7062614	7064795	Aw, but animals are so fuzzy-wuzzy.
7064815	7067496	No, she says that she wants all humans to die.
7068996	7069256	Okay.
7070216	7072877	So Ingrid Newman, I think, is her name.
7073838	7084081	So anyway, we've got this organization that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that
7084761	7085902	Are we surprised at all?
7086122	7094206	That they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at basically their target age group, which is gamer age.
7095087	7102090	They're trying to get them young, get them in our little bracket, because we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.
7103191	7105192	PETA makes so much money.
7105834	7107195	Peta is smart.
7107555	7108436	They are very smart.
7108976	7113260	Because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community.
7113280	7115121	This isn't the first time they've done something like this.
7115782	7122587	And they know that they will get completely free advertising for a very long time from doing something like this.
7122867	7125950	I like how they kind of went back on it and said, oh, it's just a joke.
7125990	7129613	But whatever their weird-ass reasoning was or whatever...
7130393	7141742	An audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought, the majority of which probably wouldn't give them a second thought, couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.
7141762	7146366	I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have a show unexpectedly, remember?
7147027	7148568	So that's when this all kind of came up.
7149048	7159517	So PETA's very smart at what they're doing, and this is all part of a calculated plan to drive more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer.
7160197	7168019	It's like you sit there in your inbox and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or you won the lottery or congratulations.
7168039	7172721	You're really the millionth visitor to this website and you really did win this.
7173481	7176162	But if one person falls for it, then...
7177839	7181762	I really hate how an organization can tell us that we are being influenced by games.
7206196	7210118	I thought that was really important because that is not unique to PETA.
7210498	7213220	That is absolutely not unique to this organization.
7213500	7216781	This is just the most recent example of this.
7217161	7224405	There's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for political office, mind you.
7224925	7226866	This is far and above any organization.
7226946	7229047	People that actually wield actual power.
7229927	7241050	that think gamers are stupid, gamers are easily influenced, gamers care nothing about more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.
7241511	7251934	You know, like, there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when the reality is, especially now thanks to Facebook, guess what?
7251994	7252974	We're all gamers.
7254688	7271583	and I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing as opposed to what they were doing before when PETA made fun of what was it Super Meat Boy was one of the games they did before they did a Cooking Mama one too most people don't know Super Meat Boy most people don't know Cooking Mama
7272323	7287030	everybody fucking knows Mario and Mario especially Mario 3 what person in their 20s or 30s or hell even most teens that weren't born when this game came out what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3
7288305	7289667	Thanks for watching!
7305047	7305367	You know.
7306549	7308250	I knew plenty of my friends.
7308290	7309852	Their parents played Mario with them.
7310533	7319843	And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no.
7320183	7321404	I know this Mario game.
7321565	7322566	And you're being stupid.
7322906	7323146	Yeah.
7323867	7328472	People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like that that they didn't know.
7328813	7335440	But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki suit... Like, here's the...
7335960	7343767	And still goes on in the email to say something like, I used to play Super Mario 3, and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat and wear him like a hat.
7344127	7351973	But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is, I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch 6 and 7 year olds when they play.
7352014	7354315	A lot of them are little freaks, and I mean that in a good way.
7354636	7360701	But a lot of them will pretend to be Tanooki Mario, like, woo, I'm flying, or I'm a Tanooki statue, you know, they'll stay, I mean...
7361241	7363443	and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb.
7363463	7364003	But guess what?
7364023	7366325	When you were six or seven, you were that dumb.
7366765	7367025	Yeah.
7367706	7369467	So you didn't want to skin your cat.
7369868	7371669	You just wanted to be Tanuki Mario.
7372109	7373510	Mario was your freaking hero.
7373650	7374331	Sure me, baby.
7374591	7376893	I'm not going to skin you, but I will use you as socks.
7377573	7378934	All I have to do is have her sit on my feet.
7379515	7379755	Anyway.
7380015	7385099	But anyway, my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that...
7385419	7387000	I didn't want to skin the cat.
7387500	7389421	I wanted to be a statue.
7389501	7391141	I wanted the freaking Hammer Brothers suit.
7391161	7392502	I wanted to save the princess.
7392782	7396623	That's because we were 6, 7, whatever age when this game came out.
7396783	7398084	I wanted to throw hammers at people.
7398104	7399004	Peeta, you're being dumb.
7399564	7400705	I wanted to throw hammers at people.
7402145	7402746	No, seriously.
7403086	7403626	That was my point.
7404927	7407248	I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once.
7408969	7411571	That could still happen.
7411651	7414233	We could still make that dream come true, DarkSakura.
7414714	7420758	By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point that I would like to bring up to our listeners of Voting Age.
7421038	7423680	Sure, and then I want to go to the chat room.
7423860	7429024	The people with power are trying to make these decisions for us.
7430465	7432707	Basically, every time that you say, fuck it,
7434199	7450002	Every time you say, I can't make a difference, or I don't feel like it, every time you display apathy, you're basically saying, do whatever you want to, I don't care.
7451223	7458164	That means the shit that's going on in the world right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault.
7459929	7464314	because you didn't vote for the people who need to be the ones to make the change.
7465055	7475027	You get enough people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.
7477791	7478592	We'll see change then.
7479537	7481339	Very serious point and very much needed.
7481419	7487285	I think everybody better make sure they vote or you can't complain about these things like SOPA and things like that because you elected these people.
7487485	7490988	My third catchphrase then, because you know my first one is welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.
7492009	7493711	The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
7494111	7496734	Number three, change doesn't happen until you make it happen.
7497228	7499331	I thought it was going to be Reject False Icons, but that works.
7499551	7500672	No, I stole from Gorillaz.
7500852	7501433	Alright, fair enough.
7502414	7504176	Technically, I stole the first one from Space Harrier.
7504296	7508962	Let me go to some lols from our chatroom, because the chatroom is bringing the lols, and it's talking about Tanuki Mario.
7509442	7512846	Kaijudo in chat says, I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario.
7513487	7517191	DDR Dollar Bill says, the only time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned.
7518612	7524576	Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says, these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.
7526176	7532260	And also says, PETA never complained about Angry Birds, a game where you slingshot birds into buildings.
7533120	7533481	Pigs.
7533841	7535442	All I have to say, wait.
7537123	7539924	Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote.
7541445	7542065	Including my husband.
7542766	7543746	Well, unless you're, you know, 17.
7544627	7546748	Well, if you're a voting age...
7548577	7552900	And if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house.
7553581	7554842	And then you mail it back in.
7555402	7556483	You know what that requires?
7556843	7558064	Walk into the mailbox.
7560666	7560966	All right.
7561627	7563768	Actdeft says, sadly, I don't live in the U.S.
7564429	7566410	Well, I meant for people who live here.
7566650	7568071	People who can vote.
7568492	7571654	Or in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote.
7573126	7575427	Your votes matter in your country, in your community.
7575447	7578329	You make the difference in your own damn community.
7578369	7580890	Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life.
7581430	7581790	The end.
7582631	7582971	All right.
7583811	7587933	I think DarkSakura is ready for the F use of the week, or maybe she already did it.
7587973	7589234	Let's get the music anyway.
7602990	7605391	My FU goes to Bones006 today.
7607731	7611953	Um... Who, uh... Can't spell.
7612413	7613553	What has an H in it.
7614053	7615094	The word is about.
7615574	7615954	Bout.
7616134	7617674	B-O-U-T is like a battle.
7618435	7619135	Or a match.
7619835	7621836	People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E.
7622016	7623316	Can't has an apostrophe in it.
7623616	7624056	And a period.
7624156	7625557	You are part of what is wrong with the country.
7626377	7627778	And everybody else, fucking vote.
7629538	7629938	Alright.
7630238	7630898	Loki.
7632439	7632539	Um...
7633217	7633598	Oh boy.
7635620	7639385	I guess I'd just say FU2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.
7642450	7643851	There's only so much time in the day.
7645429	7672874	my FU of the week just goes to like being like really really busy and just there is so much going on right now and like you know like somebody said to me last night like oh boo hoo you have the biggest problem that you have too much on your social calendar to do but I just it can be exhausting and just you know sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't want to piss people off it's just rough so F you to all that
7674656	7676557	The holidays are about loving, dammit.
7678258	7681821	I actually do have a little tiny one, people.
7683162	7691407	F you to everybody who says that Christmas is becoming less Christian because it wasn't Christian to begin with.
7692268	7694169	It was very, very, very, very pagan.
7695410	7695790	The end.
7696391	7697792	Can't we all just get along?
7697912	7698512	Oh, come on.
7698592	7699673	It was about burning trees.
7701636	7702897	How is that not pagan?
7703277	7705419	Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?
7706319	7707900	No, because fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth.
7708040	7709321	No, but he could make water into wine.
7710242	7712103	He also wasn't... Never mind.
7714444	7715525	So I have to say this.
7715585	7718327	My mom tried to have this argument with me and you were there.
7718627	7720088	That's where the gay pie party came from.
7721109	7724931	She says, well, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?
7726693	7727853	Hanukkah was always Jewish.
7729637	7757588	um yeah that made no sense mom well also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah no it's actually menorah is a Hebrew word for a candelabra the technical term is a Hanukkiah so it is how about some rapid fire gaming news Loki you have a lot of news to talk to us about we're gonna quickly go through some stories let's talk about Rhythm Heaven it's coming to the Wii in North America and
7758152	7765177	In February, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and this was announced via Nintendo Power.
7765217	7766739	So I would say that's pretty legitimate.
7769981	7771483	I hate the game, to be honest.
7772003	7774666	I played it on the DS, did not care for Rhythm Heaven.
7774706	7775767	Just not my thing.
7776307	7777528	Some people are really into it, though.
7777548	7779410	I haven't played it enough.
7779430	7783634	If you like rhythm games, by all means, go ahead and check it out.
7785055	7791461	Of course, there is supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow you to shoot some 3D video.
7792602	7795485	Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time.
7795645	7798447	It is scheduled, though, for this week on December 8th.
7798987	7800408	So you can look forward to that.
7800789	7816380	And, of course, that will give you the 3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on.
7817281	7819302	So more Mario Kart tracks, we can only hope.
7820743	7824905	Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight.
7825366	7829608	It is going to be a brand new Microsoft Flight sim.
7830468	7839132	And, of course, they haven't really unveiled too many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that series.
7839512	7842514	It's definitely popular, so that'll be cool.
7843454	7849157	And then, of course, last but not least, or actually, this is even closer to last year,
7849797	7854479	I kind of thought the theory had something like this, but it's still neat to see anyways.
7854900	7858001	There's a new device out called the Supa Boy.
7858782	7866305	And what the Supa Boy does is allows you to play Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo cartridges, on the go.
7866405	7868646	It's one of those devices that you can play.
7869007	7871108	It's like a handheld system.
7871228	7877571	And also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make like a mini console of sorts.
7878391	7882054	And so that's available for purchase as well.
7882634	7884695	And actually, I believe it's on Amazon.
7884715	7886096	Let's see what this thing goes for here.
7886116	7886096	$80.
7887217	7891700	That's almost cheaper, I think, than buying Super Nintendo.
7892180	7900425	But if you want to play something portable without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go.
7900766	7901926	That's the way to go about it.
7903147	7918014	Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched Tetris on the iOS, uh, system, or platform, if you will, but there is a little issue with it.
7918415	7919575	Um, it's $30 a year.
7921996	7928021	and you can basically... Thanks Apple for opening up the subscription thing to everybody.
7928121	7931943	Really appreciate that because EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?
7932203	7938528	It does have some new features including Galaxy Mode and Marathon One Touch Mode, whatever that means.
7939288	7963901	and also it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay and of course you can subscribe to the Tea Club which offers exclusive access to new mobile challenges and content you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you can drop $30 for a full year and of course the game costs you money anyways it's 99 cents
7967273	7967753	I'll pass.
7968093	7968834	Thank you very much.
7969474	7969834	Ditto.
7970714	7976836	And then of course, last but not least, Lego Batman 2 is going to be coming out at some point.
7977376	7983719	And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other superheroes involved with it as well, not just Batman.
7984079	7993362	In fact, there's a little teaser showing Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as some other characters.
7993442	7993662	So
7994562	7999086	and Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes will be the new title, I believe.
7999106	8003148	That'd be kind of neat.
8003309	8007792	Also, they're saying that they're expecting that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well.
8010794	8011414	Looks kind of neat.
8012215	8014717	It's going to be hard to compete with Arkham City, though, even when you're Legos.
8014857	8015957	Well, I understand that.
8016218	8017158	Lego games are pretty fun.
8017579	8020801	Lego Batman wasn't bad, so it'll be cool.
8022370	8026695	EverQuest 2 is now going free to play, but here's the weird thing, okay, EverQuest 2
8038049	8038990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8053888	8054248	Bless you.
8054668	8055349	Oh, rude.
8055369	8056329	My body faked me out.
8056470	8057450	Have you ever had that happen?
8057470	8058851	It's like, I'm going to sneeze, I'm going to sneeze.
8059031	8059511	Psych.
8059791	8060052	Yeah.
8060232	8060412	Yeah.
8060912	8061372	All right, hang on.
8061693	8063734	Great radio.
8063994	8072199	EverQuest 2 Extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2, and there will be free, there will be silver, and there will be gold.
8072719	8074782	Free members get just a little bit.
8075182	8081950	Silver members, which pay $5 or $500 station point things per month, they get a little more.
8082050	8084473	And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole $15 a month.
8084874	8086195	Well, shit, you get everything.
8086916	8088478	So there you go, EverQuest 2.
8088939	8089680	You can now check out.
8089720	8091362	I wonder if it'll get the same reception that...
8093263	8112089	DC Universe did I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff in it EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1 so people didn't want to leave EverQuest 1 which is still going still going DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
8113436	8115477	Well, I have a little something for us.
8116257	8119438	And that is something about a game that people have been waiting for.
8119478	8122899	Except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting for.
8123780	8125600	It's Kid Icarus.
8126000	8128081	But it's the 3D Classics Kid Icarus.
8128621	8133043	It's going to be given away for free when...
8135126	8137367	It launches on January 5th.
8139468	8143990	You have to register two eligible 3DS titles online this Christmas.
8146891	8149092	That's kind of janky, but alright, whatever.
8149192	8150292	It's a Club Nintendo thing.
8150932	8155374	So you get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes out next year.
8156035	8159456	But where's the... People...
8161104	8163865	I totally want a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama
8180592	8181032	There you go.
8182073	8182353	All right.
8182793	8185815	Well, believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight.
8185895	8187896	So we're going to actually open up the Skype line.
8187976	8189137	It is open now.
8189157	8193860	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8194180	8195501	There's a little bit of a delay tonight.
8195581	8201345	So before I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be a few more in a minute here.
8201365	8201645	We'll see.
8202065	8206968	Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you want to talk about, Loki, with last minute stories before we get to the Twitters?
8207228	8213271	Yeah, let's talk about how the Vita will not support simultaneous web browsing and gameplay.
8213892	8215552	You can only do one or the other at the time.
8216793	8218554	Is that really that big of a deal, though?
8218734	8219555	No, I don't think so.
8219595	8220275	I don't think so either.
8220315	8225658	I mean, I know a lot of people are making a big deal out of it, but I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like, what system now lets you do that?
8226846	8229949	Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that, hello.
8230369	8235634	But, you know, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so.
8236035	8237276	Yeah.
8237356	8244422	Also, of course, there's that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be discounted 40%.
8244983	8250628	I don't know where that's... Apparently, it said a recent Vita event is where they announced that.
8252049	8252610	In my pants.
8253591	8253611	I...
8254992	8255592	I don't think so.
8256613	8257034	I don't know.
8257394	8260857	Even if they are, that's still too damn much for those.
8261077	8261998	Yeah, and that's great.
8262118	8265341	That's promoting that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what?
8265961	8267523	I wouldn't do that anyways, because guess what?
8267983	8271246	I get tired of my games after a while, and I want to sell them used.
8272847	8273768	So, meh.
8274878	8276259	That's what I think is going to ultimately happen.
8276279	8279440	I think the hackers are going to find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards.
8280541	8281902	I could see that happening, absolutely.
8281922	8285223	Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8300529	8300910	Anything else?
8303012	8303553	I like fire.
8303573	8304034	You do?
8317210	8344678	there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name I'm so sorry but the guy was writing about how he got hacked and it's like kind of one of those things I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked to finally kind of put it out there where it's like wait a minute I didn't get phished and he even says this in the story like I don't think I got phished you know I'm not happy this is happening to people but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites
8345698	8348119	So let me go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic.
8348159	8349160	Remind me to come back to this, okay?
8349400	8350241	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8350261	8350561	Who's this?
8351141	8353622	Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma Sautome.
8353903	8354943	Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?
8355603	8356044	Not much.
8356384	8357304	A couple of things.
8357484	8361627	I just got home, so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds cookbook.
8362787	8363488	No, I didn't.
8363548	8364948	The Angry Birds cookbook.
8364968	8367150	Good God, could this game get any more saturated?
8370471	8371812	It's a cash cow, what can I tell you?
8371992	8372533	Yeah, right?
8373033	8373213	Mm-hmm.
8373860	8375721	So what is in the Angry Birds cookbook?
8375761	8376801	What will I learn how to cook?
8376881	8377202	Birds?
8378422	8378982	Actually, I don't know.
8379062	8383304	I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to read into it.
8386426	8386826	What's that?
8386906	8387246	I'm sorry.
8387286	8388226	DarkSakura's phone went off.
8389247	8394489	I said I just saw it online on a friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered.
8395830	8400872	Maybe it talks about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.
8402731	8404452	or pig themed recipes.
8405413	8405853	Seriously?
8405913	8407394	An Angry Birds cookbook?
8407434	8407995	Like how?
8408375	8408675	I don't know.
8408715	8409076	Forget it.
8411017	8413499	I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade.
8413519	8414940	I think that's Loki's department.
8415550	8416991	Loki's all tiraded out tonight.
8417011	8422333	I don't know if you heard part A. No, I was at a premiere tonight.
8422493	8423033	That's all right.
8424114	8428515	Let's just say that Xenoblade news just kind of one thing led to another on that department.
8431036	8431677	Oh, God.
8431697	8434318	I can't wait to listen to tonight's episode.
8434418	8436099	Oh, and our website's coming back.
8436159	8437399	That's the big news you missed too.
8438099	8440881	We'll be back just depending on when DNS updates for people.
8440961	8442181	So hopefully within 24 hours.
8442701	8443081	Wonderful.
8443282	8443402	Yep.
8444810	8448351	But the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.
8449072	8449972	A game review?
8450272	8450792	All right.
8451032	8451792	What do you want to review?
8452973	8458055	Voltron, Defender of the Universe for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
8459115	8460436	What?
8460536	8461036	You didn't know?
8461456	8461816	No.
8462356	8463537	Yes, it came out Wednesday.
8463557	8464217	I'm in school.
8464297	8464997	I have no life.
8466738	8468818	She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft.
8468858	8473020	But anyway, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.
8474557	8482984	Long and short of it, you are in control of any of the five lions and it's up to you to protect the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat Lotor.
8483945	8485306	Is it like a tower defense game?
8485726	8486427	Actually, no.
8486827	8490631	The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars.
8491391	8492032	Oh, that's kind of cool.
8492052	8492832	I like Geometry Wars.
8493593	8496916	Now, take your typical treasure shooter.
8498450	8499190	It's like that.
8499390	8506854	You're pretty much running around the plains just blasting everything that the lasers can see.
8507994	8510635	Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up DarkSakura's alley.
8512256	8515437	It's a cave shooter, or treasure shooter mixed with... Want.
8516078	8516398	Want.
8516458	8517979	You should go download the demo on Xbox.
8518239	8518819	I think I will.
8520240	8521160	Ukchan, one more thing.
8521980	8522280	Yes.
8522941	8527923	If you like it, depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.
8529499	8530960	Aw, what a nice boy.
8531500	8532061	Aw, okay.
8532281	8533922	That's the best part about doing this show.
8533982	8534362	I'll play it.
8534382	8535243	Once in a while, free shit.
8535823	8536924	Heck yeah.
8537424	8538024	Thank you.
8538364	8539265	Love you, Ranma.
8539765	8540306	Love you, mean it.
8540966	8548370	So on a scale of one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?
8548931	8549291	Seven.
8550612	8551532	That's a pretty good review.
8551552	8552813	So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger?
8553593	8554194	Hell yeah.
8554594	8558096	Now what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?
8558857	8559939	Your butt's for babies.
8561281	8563564	As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate.
8563885	8568652	Hey, Ranma, do you know what I actually just watched all of last week?
8569113	8569333	What?
8569914	8570415	Go Lion.
8572138	8574161	I have all of it and I watched all of it.
8574912	8578615	By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Row is called Hate is Gonna Hate.
8579035	8579656	I heard about that.
8579676	8580797	I saw somebody get that on Twitter.
8581277	8582258	And Ranma.
8585401	8586482	This is such a great story.
8586502	8587502	You're gonna hate it, but I don't care.
8587863	8589524	Okay, so I thought of you this week.
8590045	8590245	Yeah.
8590725	8592407	Okay, I was watching Wendy Williams.
8593479	8594099	That's a man.
8594179	8595020	I just want you to know.
8595040	8596020	That's a man.
8596600	8596860	Okay.
8597681	8599881	But you know I love Wendy Williams, okay?
8599941	8600802	How you doing?
8601462	8604783	And she was talking about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something.
8604823	8609345	And at the end of it, she said, and I kid you not, she said, stay black.
8610245	8613026	And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?
8613406	8614827	Because I thought that joke started here.
8614847	8616888	Wait, wait, wait.
8617228	8617808	Rob, stop.
8617908	8618068	What?
8618088	8620389	You said you like Wendy Williams?
8621667	8622547	Haters gonna hate.
8623768	8625028	50 points from Gryffindor.
8627709	8628049	All right.
8628269	8635111	Look, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them.
8635412	8637572	In this case, somebody saying stay black.
8638773	8640573	Because that all started with you here on the show, you know.
8640913	8641634	It didn't actually.
8642194	8642554	It's not.
8644017	8647998	Just related to... It's a phrase that's been out for a long time.
8648018	8650739	Yes, I know that, but I'm just saying.
8650899	8654199	I heard it in mainstream press this week and it made me think of our Ranma.
8655180	8655740	Stay black.
8657200	8658460	Dan didn't bring me any pie.
8658520	8659140	I'm mad at him.
8660461	8662101	Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get more calls.
8662701	8663381	Go back to Voltron.
8663421	8663742	Have fun.
8664642	8665582	And of course, stay black.
8666263	8667103	and you stay fabulous.
8667264	8667544	I will.
8667604	8668604	Oh, I will, girl.
8668804	8669044	All right.
8669765	8671946	Bye.
8671966	8675848	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8675908	8677709	Kaijudo in chat says stay black as an old saying.
8677829	8678549	I know that.
8678629	8680690	Gosh, I'm just being silly.
8682071	8682411	All right.
8684072	8688294	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8689714	8690975	How about some tweets in the meantime?
8694685	8709134	OLRFanForever, hey I like that name, that's a great Twitter name, OLRFanForever, and it's like it's not my mom or something, like it's an actual person OLRFanForever asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester?
8709795	8711696	Was DarkSakura eliminated?
8712817	8718080	Actually, I believe DarkSakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention, correct?
8718715	8720036	I just didn't bother promoting it.
8721597	8728022	That night it was funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that?
8729062	8732805	It was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland.
8733986	8737248	On the negative side, I would be whoring myself out to Sony.
8738449	8739370	I am no one's whore.
8742281	8749907	Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo
8761676	8763697	Absolutely adorable.
8763977	8765397	Aw, look at her little hoodie on and stuff.
8765477	8767118	I know, it's precious.
8767198	8767698	I love it.
8767738	8768738	Alright, sorry to derail.
8769298	8771459	Sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said.
8771879	8772699	What's on your mind, buddy?
8773779	8775320	Jim Sally train's coming in today.
8775540	8777060	We gotta have some discussions, people.
8778361	8786063	First off, we need to talk about Evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers' issues with these game cards expiring.
8786883	8787203	It's not...
8787853	8791674	We really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their game cards expire.
8791774	8793595	It's Evil G's fault.
8793955	8798756	If I went to the grocery store to buy some milk and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer.
8799036	8801077	I'd yell at the store that sold me the expired milk.
8801737	8804177	I think EB Games should be taking these games off their shelves.
8804578	8805758	It shouldn't be EA's fault.
8806058	8808619	You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it.
8808859	8811799	I have to admit, I didn't really think about it like that.
8812280	8812860	I mean, I don't know.
8812900	8813260	I kind of...
8814494	8815515	I get what you're saying.
8815615	8820858	I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I feel like they didn't really think about this before they implemented this.
8820878	8822759	I don't think they informed the stores either that they have this problem.
8822779	8824380	And I kind of think the stores don't know either.
8824421	8825921	I think people just kind of didn't know.
8825941	8827983	They told Evil G. You know what Evil G is.
8828363	8829984	They would just pretend like they didn't know.
8830444	8831325	Sell it to you anyway.
8831425	8831945	I don't care.
8832706	8833787	So they're all in cahoots?
8834847	8835788	I don't think they're in cahoots.
8835808	8837509	I think Evil G is just doing it anyway.
8837909	8838790	EA probably told...
8839789	8860588	Evil G, yo give us those games back if you don't sell them Evil G's like whatever we can sell anything I would honestly think though that Evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe like an independent ma and pa shop who you know only rarely gets a lot of people that come through there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time and
8863390	8878859	I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their shelf and I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't control that no one wants the goddamn game I don't know
8879161	8881362	Well, either way, it ain't EBA's fault.
8881382	8883063	How long are they supposed to keep these codes active for?
8883463	8884224	And it's a service.
8884264	8885824	There's no monetary value to it.
8885844	8886144	Right.
8886164	8887125	Because it's a service.
8887525	8888586	It's not like a gift card.
8889106	8894489	A gift card is an account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency.
8894889	8896550	I realize the gift card thing is a stretch.
8896570	8899231	It is a service being provided later.
8900452	8909642	It is a little bit like you can't, it's not apples to apples comparison, but my point with that was that it's still, it would be $10 to replace that pass.
8910503	8915208	So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly you're losing.
8916169	8917870	You know, it's not a gift card per se.
8917910	8918131	Yeah.
8921502	8930626	Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year.
8930806	8931546	And here's the other thing too.
8931566	8932406	Look at Blizzard games.
8932587	8938529	If they're saying that, oh, by the way, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st.
8939289	8940650	Okay, well then I'm going to buy used.
8941210	8944671	Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive to do so?
8944691	8945772	That's not the way to do it.
8946826	8947907	Really, it's not a way to do it?
8948127	8952550	We shouldn't punish the publishers for doing this kind of bullshit?
8952650	8955251	How am I supposed to keep the stuff all open for?
8955512	8957233	I don't even think it's a punishment thing.
8957273	8961115	It's just any shopper is going to find the best value they can.
8961916	8962556	Yeah, man.
8964057	8964657	It's up to you.
8965118	8967019	When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up.
8967717	8969197	to the dealership down the street.
8969237	8971618	You shop around a little bit before you buy it.
8972298	8975119	You have to educate yourself a little bit before you buy it.
8975139	8976539	Yeah, and play the game with people.
8976559	8977619	Everyone's got a different deal.
8978399	8985721	But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that.
8985861	8994403	If there's nothing there, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game and someone hasn't played this copy of the game.
8995163	9002771	Then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new, I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap.
9002811	9008676	Now going back to the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore?
9009017	9012420	Because they know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day.
9012540	9015303	EA has already made their money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf.
9015343	9018586	They don't care at this point if the game is sold new or used because they already sold the game.
9018666	9023850	They're probably not buying new copies of that game anyway, so they probably have a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyway.
9024550	9031114	And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, say I want to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that.
9031174	9039120	Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies that are used that are in good quality that you can get for $5, $10 cheaper or whatever.
9039760	9041982	And most people are like, okay, sure, I'll do that.
9042942	9044804	Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that.
9044924	9045064	But
9045784	9055669	You can probably guess that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run of Mass Effect 2.
9055809	9062071	Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, well not a Game of the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.
9062752	9065753	That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.
9067403	9068043	I mean, I don't know.
9068504	9071125	I haven't really looked at it, but they may have.
9071705	9071945	All right.
9072266	9075587	Well, Jim, Sally, I've got to wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets.
9075607	9079009	Do you have any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter?
9079650	9080950	South Park Games is going to be a great game.
9080970	9081631	Obsidian is doing it.
9081651	9083031	They're the best developers ever in the world.
9083092	9086713	Obsidian, thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 New Vegas.
9088178	9103449	Knights of the Republic 2 I love you everybody and don't forget if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed you're picking it too much or not enough thank you for that sage advice Jim Sally appreciate it
9104660	9106762	I have high hopes for the South Park game too, I will say.
9107062	9108142	So I hope they don't let me down.
9108743	9110363	Back to the Twitters.
9110383	9112445	1877GameOLR, username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
9112465	9113945	We can probably squeeze in like one more call.
9114806	9120749	DarkTetsuyo tweeted us and said, Hey, OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One.
9121009	9122550	I don't think I've ever loved a book this much.
9122870	9123230	P.S.
9123291	9124111	Fuck the Sixers.
9124231	9125313	I'm assuming that's something from the book?
9125633	9125973	Yes, it is.
9141208	9146270	saying the Day One Studios who developed Fear 3 and Mecha Salt, they laid off 95%.
9147691	9152713	That's an entire development team because they lost a publishing deal with Konami.
9153373	9156834	Apparently, they were working on a reboot of Silent Scope.
9157855	9158375	Interesting.
9158975	9164117	But I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they pulled it.
9164677	9165218	I guess.
9165938	9168719	Yeah, Silent Scope's kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go...
9170251	9174237	Maybe with all the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off.
9174938	9175239	Maybe.
9175459	9176701	Well, they didn't have to do it that way.
9176721	9179485	I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now.
9179505	9184232	They have Sniper Elite, and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior or something like that.
9184753	9185354	That was...
9187089	9216729	um actually pretty well liked and they have sequels coming out I mean there's not a lot of sniper games but I think something like Silent Scope would have stood out I would have guessed that they were working on was it that I remember the fuck the series is called now the one that was on the PSP and then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3 it was like a sci-fi shooter or something like that I don't even remember that's how wonderful that game was um but there was it was supposed to be like a launch title for the PS3 but I guess that would have been a little late
9217069	9217990	Alright, let me go to the phones.
9218010	9218750	We've got one more call.
9218790	9219651	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9219671	9219991	Who's this?
9221553	9222613	Hi, this is Kokomo.
9223054	9223974	I just have a question.
9224034	9229298	When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3?
9230439	9232040	That's a lot of Mass Effect.
9232100	9241127	I've got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me, but here's the thing.
9241267	9244890	What I really like about what they're doing with Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea.
9244950	9246211	I mean, I guess this is from that
9246311	9270831	Demo that leaked out before and all that remember how they had the demo up early is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode that focuses more on the battle it's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end of the game you like more and the RPG mode to me sounds really really interesting because I do think Bioware can tell some good stories so but as far as like do I have enough time to freaking play Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably not
9271971	9294885	but if Mass Effect 2 or if they do with 3 what they do with 2 didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect 1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game sort of yeah on the PS3 they did so maybe there'll be something like that so at least the rest of us can get caught up what's your opinion on it are you a Mass Effect fan
9296320	9298081	I really do enjoy Mass Effect.
9298101	9304305	I'm probably going to have to take a whole week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3.
9304345	9308207	Then you have all the different things.
9308388	9311169	You can be evil, and that's another play around.
9311590	9313591	It's just so much time.
9314537	9315298	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9333653	9335193	based on how he was playing the story.
9335213	9350437	And this is one thing that Bioware is really good at, and it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about the Old Republic, because love or hate Star Wars, they're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect-style storytelling in Dragon Age into an MMO, and for some people, that's very, very exciting.
9352178	9352838	Absolutely.
9353638	9354818	All right, that's all my questions.
9354838	9355898	You guys have a great night.
9356018	9357339	That's it, all right.
9357379	9358179	Thanks for your station.
9358502	9358822	I won't, bye
9382065	9395775	TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here, and that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to Astoria1up.com.
9397736	9424465	where apparently the Digital Millennium Copyright Act the DMCA a few exemptions were granted about a year ago which had to do with the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use now the EFF is saying shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well if you want to mod your video game consoles what do you think I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if you can jailbreak your phone why can't you jailbreak your video game console
9425307	9428050	I was going to say, is it really illegal to do that right now?
9450669	9454050	Uh, technically, I mean, sort of it is.
9454150	9455991	I mean, but they're just not going to come after the user.
9456431	9469295	Especially now that, you know, they have, in fact, ironically enough, I'm looking at something right now about reset glitch hacking on, well, you can do it on any Xbox 360 regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now.
9469915	9472956	And looking at, you know, slim modding and stuff like that.
9472996	9475337	Just curious to see what's required for that stuff.
9477238	9477658	Interesting.
9478474	9482877	I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem.
9482937	9490901	It's that they don't want you playing pirated games on it for one and using exploits and all that stuff as well.
9490981	9495804	So that's why usually these companies will kick you off the network, which they can do because it's their network.
9496104	9496464	Exactly.
9496725	9501187	But for instance, didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation 3s because they were supercomputers?
9501467	9501687	Uh-huh.
9501888	9502348	They probably...
9503088	9505230	Never upgraded them, or who knows?
9505310	9509893	Maybe they even found a workaround so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.
9509913	9510913	Is that illegal?
9511133	9513175	I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation Network.
9513415	9516757	They're just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter.
9519235	9519535	All right.
9520455	9523997	Well, that's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight, and that's also going to do it for the Skype line.
9524017	9532340	Big apologies to those who didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+.
9532440	9536081	We'll take your comments there, too, and we can read some of those on the show.
9536141	9537762	But for now, that's it.
9537842	9538522	We're wrapping up.
9538542	9539202	We're getting out of here.
9539242	9540843	You were done with last-minute stories, right, Loki?
9541223	9541743	Yeah.
9541823	9542023	Okay.
9542703	9543764	I didn't have anything.
9544628	9547129	I figured, because you would have spoke up if you did.
9548049	9548309	Hey!
9549690	9552291	So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio.
9552891	9557012	It's almost 9 o'clock or midnight on the East Coast, so I think it's about time to wrap up.
9558032	9560373	First off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show.
9560473	9563134	Thank you for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9563254	9568576	It's been kind of a poopy past couple weeks with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us.
9569336	9571737	and those of you that are listening live or still showing up and listening live.
9571757	9572897	We have a lot of people in chat tonight.
9572917	9573697	So thank you guys so much.
9573757	9577238	And podcasties, you've stuck by us and here you are downloading another show.
9577258	9578399	So I really appreciate it.
9578759	9579639	Thanks for the support.
9580379	9583540	Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money.
9583920	9586521	Although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.
9586961	9587782	Yes.
9587822	9588702	That will be an exception.
9589322	9605256	uh but you know here on this program we don't ask for your money all we ask help spread the word tell somebody about the program and uh you know help the OL Army grow so on that note let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can get out of here tonight Loki I'll start with you your final thought tonight
9605812	9609155	My final thought is I'm picking a really weird song for Cage Match.
9609575	9609855	Awesome.
9611377	9621444	My final thought is now that Loki's Lamey Borrows Saints Row the Third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the character that Travis Donovan made?
9621464	9625067	Online pass is only for playing co-op or system link.
9625627	9626288	All right.
9626488	9627869	I'm going to have to figure out how to do that.
9627929	9631271	I want Travis Donovan's little character of me.
9631331	9634873	You need to create a profile on the Saints Row website.
9635033	9647360	Once you do that, you go browse to his character and you add it as a bookmark or something like that and you go into your game and you log in with your account from the Saints Row website and then you can download it.
9647700	9648120	I can do that.
9648741	9648901	Yes.
9649181	9649421	Awesome.
9650662	9652383	Alright, and DarkSakura, your final thought.
9652708	9653329	Thanks for watching!
9674683	9674924	All right.
9674944	9677847	Well, thank you guys again for tuning in and downloading the show.
9678088	9685777	And one more time, awesome event happening this Thursday, December 8th, 630 Pacific, 930 Eastern, umlaut.org.
9686378	9687239	I'll be there live.
9687299	9688701	DarkSakura will be there in-house.
9688741	9691284	If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you better be at the DNA Lounge.
9691364	9692265	Bring 10 bucks.
9692366	9693207	Bring a little more.
9693727	9697489	to donate for some raffle tickets and stuff to a great cause, Umlaut.
