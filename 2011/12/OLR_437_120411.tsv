103600	104600	Weh.
104600	105600	Weh.
105600	106600	Weh.
106600	112880	has been down due to some stuff and things. We'll leave it at that. And out of our control.
112880	115520	And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes. Namely, and I want to give
115520	120640	a shout out to, Jason and Dekeman, behind the scenes, have ensured that it will be back
120640	124280	up. Now here's the thing. I could flip the switch right now and some people would see
124280	128160	it, but it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out. The way DNS works out,
128160	133480	it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours. But exactly. So that
133480	139240	also keep, you know, keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you
139240	143240	have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.
143240	147920	Stop. All right. But, uh, anyhow, the, and, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.
147920	151240	We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site, so everybody will get the
151240	154600	show and we'll have a website again. Yay. You better watch out though. If they catch
154600	158400	you, um, pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison
158400	164800	for no reason. Why are we talking about this? I'm trying to be happy about the show. Coming
164800	170940	back for the show. Yay. Ah, party. All right. Anyhow, orange launch radio.com by the time
170940	175460	the podcast, the people download this in here, it's probably back up and running live listeners.
175460	178240	You're finding out about two minutes after I did. I said, I said you all would be the
178240	182800	first to know. So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, cause right
182800	186760	now try to do a show. Why are you showing me up your sleeve? I'm, I'm looking at my
186760	191320	fake watch. Even though we are not televised, I'm still going through the motions and looking
191320	198440	at my fake watch. Anyhow. Um, what else was I going to say? Damn you woman, you threw
198440	205240	me off. Um, chat.orangelaungeradio.com. It does work. It's up right now. Even on the
205240	208520	backup site for the folks listening live, we do encourage you to join our chat room
208520	214500	at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want,
214500	222120	such as, uh, Jim Sally in our chat room says 24 hour pirate special at olr.com. You can
222120	228520	get lots of booty at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. Um, yes. What? You get that look
228520	231740	on your face. Like I have something smart assed. I'm going to say, yes, but it doesn't
231740	235360	fit into the conversation that we're having right now. I'll save it. Does it ever fit
235360	239640	into the conversation we're having right now? It's unfortunately a week too late. So a week
239640	244280	too late. Yes, it is a week too late. All right, now I have to know what's your week
244280	253400	old joke. Say it. Well, the Xbox luba has a slick interface. No, that's still funny.
253400	257320	Xbox lube jokes are still funny. It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't
257320	260560	been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website, but there will be
260560	268520	anyhow. All right, look, I want to talk about other exciting things. Not only is our website
268520	272160	coming back up, but um, there's an awesome charity event. We've pimped this on the show
272160	278120	for years. There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday in San
278120	281880	Francisco. So if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, you need to go to this event because
281880	286360	I'm going to be there. Dark soccer is going to be there. Loki, not going to be there,
286360	290520	but he'll be thinking about it. I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part
290520	294940	of it. I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim. The moment I said that
294940	299140	Shermie looked up at me like the hell you will. But here's the thing, dark soccer and
299140	304320	I are going to San Francisco and um, salacious doesn't call. We don't honestly just pop anymore,
304320	309500	but Alan is going to be very honest, you know, had, you know, had I not been locked into
309500	314880	the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have been one that, uh, the
314880	318900	be on the stage thing, you know? Oh yeah, I know. Be true to the rock band cause I like
318900	322060	winning eBay auctions. So you know, well let me, let me back up for those that don't know
322060	325500	what Loom loud is cause I know we've talked about this for years on the show. We're very
325500	328840	grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like some people in chat room mentioning
328840	332000	early. I've been listening for five years. I've been listening since it was single digits
332000	336020	in the show. Um, we've been pivoting this for a long time. It's a great charity event.
336020	339520	It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA lounge, which is an actual venue and
339520	343240	there's, there's a lot of famous stuff that happens to DNA lounge. Um, club booty is one
343240	346840	of the biggest examples of that. That's the mashup club night where they actually like
346840	351720	mash songs together and some of those huge mashups song things that you hear out there
351720	357200	have come out of that club. By the way, on Thursday before Loom load, uh, club booty
357200	360160	is going to be spinning for an hour. So that's kind of cool. So that's, that'll be a part
360160	365200	of it. Um, but anyhow, what happens to Loom loud is people pay money, they get on stage,
365200	370100	they play rock band in front of a crowd full of nerds and people have like minded mindset.
370100	373980	So everybody gets into it. Everybody's drinking, everybody's having a great time and it's all
373980	378060	for a great cause. They collect money at the door. It's 10 bucks to get in. Um, and that
378060	382340	money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event, which is really worth it alone,
382340	387440	but you get to pick a prize off the swag table. And I'm not allowed to say what I know about
387440	392520	the swag table this year, but there's like really good stuff that people are going to
392520	396440	walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event.
396440	399520	And they're going to be doing a raffle. They're going to be doing these silent auctions. I
399520	402160	don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction. I don't know what I can and
402160	405080	can't say, so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty, but
405080	409760	I will say, but I will say this, this, the silent auction stuff is amazing too. Like
409760	416520	one of the items in particular. Oh my God. Oh my God. Anybody that like grew up on an
416520	420640	NES is going to lose their shit over this. It's amazing. So, and I, I can't remember
420640	423600	if that's one of the eBay ones or not, because yes, you're going to be able to participate
423600	428000	online as well. And you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and, and, and the so-called
428000	433520	you're going to get to watch it online. It's all streaming at umlaut.org. And why am I
433520	439200	pimping this so bad? I'd be pimping it anyway, but I'm especially pimping it because there's
439200	445400	a live pre-show for the first time ever. That's going to be happening video from it. And they
445400	451080	asked me to co-host. So I'm going to be doing it with, um, uh, some other friends in the
451080	454760	gaming community, including carnage, who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff, uh, which
454760	458440	would be very cool. Some other folks from other websites are involved too. So it's no
458440	463680	like singular website doing it. This is not an OLR show. It's just, we're helping. We're
463680	467440	one of the cooks in the kitchen with this. So, and it's going to be great. Um, met a
467440	472360	lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place. And, um, yeah, it's, it's
472360	478120	going to be a kick ass show. So make plans to be here Thursday, six 30 Pacific nine 30
478120	483800	Eastern. Um, loud. That's U M L O U D.org. Now you have no excuse not to be there. It's
483800	487860	going to be delivered to your house. I'm also selling autographs on people's foreheads for
487860	493560	10 bucks. Don't spend dollar donations. Why not put it in the donation box? I'll sign
493560	497480	your forehead. You know what? If you're, if you will donate $20 to the cause, I'll make
497480	501880	out with you. No, I'm just kidding. Video camera. Only if you're hot. No, I'm just,
501880	506760	I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But we will, I, we are going to lend our full support and
506760	511520	if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what? We'll have
511520	514560	a drink together. I can say at least that much. Yeah. We're not really going to make
514560	521000	out with you. No. Okay. And dark soccer will not show you her boots. No, but, but I am,
521000	527080	um, the designer this year. Um, I will not say much more than that, but you get to see
527080	536440	my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall and other things. Good stuff. So yeah.
536440	539240	And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little
539240	544240	creepy because I don't do video. Like I've done, you can see my work on that too. I've
544240	550640	done, uh, audio stuff since 97. So this is one of the first, I mean, besides back when
550640	555000	we were doing the Justin TV, like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show, which I
555000	558280	don't think makes her exciting video, but some people miss it. Maybe it'll come back
558280	564920	someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it. Um, but uh, yeah, I, I, I'm excited.
564920	571080	I'm into it. I'm, I'm, I'm happy. You look perky. Yeah. It's been, it's been a busy week
571080	575200	and I've just had that coffee right over there. That coffee right over there that no one can
575200	579040	see, but us and websites coming back. I don't know if you heard, but it's very exciting.
579040	585440	I was going to get some red bull before the show, but I have a Pepsi and as of at night,
585440	588960	my night couldn't get any better. Look at this. Look at this. My buddy, my pal Loki
588960	594080	tech master Loki brought me saints row the third on Xbox three 60 granted to borrow,
594080	599000	not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months. So
599000	603840	you completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister from the dollar
603840	613780	store. I got Robin snow globe. It was the thought that counts. I waited in line twice
613780	620080	as long as I spent shopping. All right. I hate the dollar store this time of year. All
620080	625160	right. Uh, going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge, radio.com salacious pop
625160	630780	in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler. At least he's a little
630780	640000	balder than me, which isn't saying much. Anyhow. All right. Uh, look, it's not, it's not about
640000	644320	that. It's about getting you guys to show up. They, they know this is the thing. They
644320	648920	know that the OLR and that the all games people are rabid people and they will wear when we
648920	653780	will do this stuff, they're, they're more likely to show up. So you guys have to represent
653780	658960	not just OLR, but all games and show up and cheer loudly and be excited about them loud.
658960	663800	And most of all, please donate. I know, I know it's a tough time of year, but, uh, keep
663800	667760	in mind the charity. There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher and we're
667760	671640	going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity. So again,
671640	678920	um, loud.org on Thursday. Alrighty. How about video games? Let's get back into how our gaming
678920	681920	weeks were and all that good stuff. We always like to kick off the show a little bit. How
681920	685320	was your gaming week? Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? I played stuff that wasn't
685320	691680	well. That made me played well too. But last night started the family tradition. We broke
691680	697760	out the Saturn and played Christmas nights. Oh, it must be the holidays. And then we realized
697760	702200	that our battery wasn't working so we couldn't save anything. But Dan decided that he was
702200	707500	going to play Ray Earth anyway, so he started playing Ray Earth. I finally played my copy
707500	712720	of P.O.P.O. 2 on the Sega Saturn. And you know what? That game sucks. Not that it sucks
712720	718180	that it's a bad game because P.O.P.O. is awesome. It kicked my ass. I am that out of practice
718180	726440	on P.O.P.O. And we played through, um, Parodius Da. We played through, um, G.K.O. Parodius.
726440	734640	Um, sorry. Sorry. Gokugio Parodius. Um, we played through, um, a little bit of, uh, Oceberry
734640	741320	Parodius. A lot of Parodius. Um, Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized
741320	747560	that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn. Um, and then he beat, uh, Thunder
747560	752760	Force 3 on Saturn. Like, just sat down and played. There's apparently something called
752760	757560	kids mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields. So he
757560	763700	was just doing stress relief mode pretty much. Um, we played, I played actually, um, some
763700	770240	of the Blue Seed RPG until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG
770240	775880	because I read, like, a retarded five-year-old in Japanese. You had quite the Sega-filled
775880	781040	retro week. There's more. Oh my. I found my Utena game. I didn't play it. Was that the
781040	786000	Dish game? No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura. I can never remember
786000	790800	these things. But there was Clamp involved because it played Rayearth. And, um, I was
790800	794040	gonna play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or
794040	802560	anything, so. And, um, also, um, I bought Dan's present. Don't tell him anybody. It's
802560	810520	b-b-b-b-b-b. That's what Dan got. I'm not gonna repeat that. No, I'm not gonna tell
810520	813840	anybody what I got, Dan, because they'll tell him because of freaking internet. People can't
813840	824200	keep a secret. What's up with that? Um, and then, um, I bathed the cat. That's a game
824200	830840	all in itself. Uh, that's just, see what offended faces Shermie can make at you. She's asleep
830840	834160	in her bed now, but she doesn't- She does look cleaner. She's a lot cleaner. She doesn't
834160	837680	smell like her ass anymore. That's a good thing when she's right underneath me. She
837680	842980	doesn't smell like Old Lady anymore. Alright. I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like Cat Old
842980	848760	Lady. Uh, comments from chat.orangelandtrady.com. ActDeft in our chat room says, it's officially
848760	853440	the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights. That is true.
853440	859520	Uh, let's see. Misty says, woo, kid mode. Sounds good for me. Right? Preach it. I also
859520	863200	have to say, I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate
863200	870700	last night, that Dan was, um, the, the little night song was playing and I remembered the
870700	875080	whole thing. I was singing along with it. The other thing I remembered the whole thing
875080	879040	of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese. You know why
879040	884320	that is? What? Because you're a nerd. So, I love this song. It's a cute song. Alright.
884320	888840	Loki, how was your gaming week? Did you play any, uh, old school Sega? I too broke out
888840	894920	the Sega, uh, Saturn to, uh, to play Hanukkah Nights. It's not quite as popular as Christmas
894920	899080	Nights, but, uh, but there's eight stages, eight stages since a little longer. Um, so
899080	908480	it was, it was pretty good. Um, no, actually I, I played, uh, lots of Skyrim and, uh, ran
908480	915200	across my, uh, fair share of glitches. Um, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity
915200	922760	on, uh, Facebook. This, uh, I fought a dragon and all of a sudden it froze for a second.
922760	929480	And then this giant, like, dirt thing was in front of me. I mean, we'll have to post
929480	933880	it to the, uh, Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing
933880	937760	down here. Just to give you an idea how tall this thing is. It's just ridiculous. It's
937760	944760	like an old faithful made out of dirt. Yeah, pretty much. And, and it is completely non-solid.
944760	948360	You can just run right through it. Cause it's like, ooh, big mountain that it created. And,
948360	955520	uh, it's weird. That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, um, today I was playing,
955520	960040	all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like,
960040	965880	wait, this is that same dragon I just killed like hours ago, days ago. It just fell from
965880	971520	the sky again. Uh, it's so glitchy. I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple of weeks just because
971520	975380	of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but, um, I really need to play
975380	981840	it more. God fucking chat. What, what did Chad do now? They're making assumptions. So
981840	986640	I just said it. You're dirty. So, um, yeah, I mean, I've been, and I haven't really been
986640	992120	doing anything. I actually had to force myself to go to the next like actual quest or the
992120	997640	storyline quest. And, um, but along the way, of course, I had to like waste a bunch of
997640	1004320	time and went back to Helgen and picked up everything that wasn't attached to the ground
1004320	1009840	and stored it into a, you know, a night table. Apparently those night tables have, uh, some
1009840	1015400	sort of magical properties that you can store just everything in them. Like, you know, eight,
1015400	1020520	you know, great swords. Yeah, sure. Why not? You know, armor, tons of it. Comment from
1020520	1025320	Kaijuto in our chat room. Is he playing Skyrim on 360? I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.
1025320	1030800	I got a dragon flying backwards today. That's about it. Uh, yeah, 360. I was playing on
1030800	1036000	PS3. I didn't notice any bugs really. I'm playing, um, still on the last patch, the
1036000	1041960	one one because I'm not dumb enough to download one two. I'm just like, nope, I'm not going
1041960	1047840	to download that. I, I like having magical resistance and stuff like that and my dragons
1047840	1055360	flying forward. Um, so I've been playing, um, that and then actually I'm setting up
1055360	1060760	my J tag to play once I'm done, how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything.
1060760	1067520	Go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can, uh, port over
1067520	1073360	the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a J tag, which is fantastic. And so you can
1073360	1077480	do a bunch of cool things with that. Um, of course I'm not doing that right now. I'm actually
1077480	1082180	just playing legitimately. Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations
1082180	1087040	where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their
1087040	1092120	belongings, which is never a good idea because I, I started selling some firewood back to
1092120	1097720	one of the ends or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel
1097720	1102840	were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place of everything that was not
1102840	1108000	steel. And so now they, you know, people eating, I'm taking your food, you know, and just all
1108000	1113160	sorts of fun stuff like that. Awesome. Um, Hey, you helped him out. What's theirs is
1113160	1119880	yours. Exactly. And then I sold it back to them, which is great. Um, you can do some
1119880	1124000	mean things in Skyrim. There's some like really funny stuff. Like I went to this one Fort
1124000	1127600	and all these bandits are running around. There's this old woman and she's like, I come
1127600	1132320	with the Fort and you know, there's people coming and going. I don't know who's taking
1132320	1136520	over one side wins, the other side comes back and blah, blah, blah. So meanwhile, all these
1136520	1141840	bandits are attacking it and I'm attacking them. And she's like, I think you should leave.
1141840	1149880	And it was hilarious. I'm like, I'm going to kill you bitch. Keep like fucking talking
1149880	1154920	to me. And then she finally, she's still there, but you know, now the Imperial forces are
1154920	1159600	there. And this is hilarious because she's like, yeah, these people that have captured
1159600	1166840	her, she's just like, I think you should go like, well, no, I'm not going to. You know,
1166840	1172600	the thing Skyrim obviously is, is doing amazingly well, you know, and it's a single player game
1172600	1176960	and everything. And I noticed a lot of what makes single player games really transcend
1176960	1180480	into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like
1180480	1184300	grand theft auto four or grand theft auto three, which while granted they do have their
1184300	1187520	multiplayer modes, they're probably more known for their single player. I think these games
1187520	1193400	that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable
1193400	1198200	stuff that the people create in the environments. Part of the reason why you really love saints
1198200	1203360	row too is that, you know, it's, it's a very absurd sandbox. It's somebody pooped in the
1203360	1212080	sandbox and it's, it's still has its own microcosm. Yeah, I really do. I'm probably going to go
1212080	1216720	back to saying it's row again cause I was looking at Tim. I, I don't have all the achievements
1216720	1222200	yet. I'm almost there, but I just haven't, I really hated doing the, um, car theft missions
1222200	1228280	and so I didn't. And then I also have to replay the game as a, you know, a female character
1228280	1232760	for at least two hours and get that achievement. Um, and then I have to finish some of the
1232760	1237520	other story missions in a different way than I did before. But you know, it's almost at
1237520	1240680	the end. Uh, the other thing I played this week also was called duty, modern warfare
1240680	1245600	one, you know, call duty four. Uh, we went, now we're in sibling, just regular free for
1245600	1249360	all death matches. We're going old school free for all death matches, which is kind
1249360	1252320	of a little bit like grand theft auto death matches where you start off with the same
1252320	1256200	weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along. So it's kind of fun just
1256200	1260360	mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game. Uh, eventually the problem
1260360	1265000	is so it's like every time I'm like, can I go work on the mod game or I can play Skyrim
1265000	1269960	and usually Skyrim where it wins out, you know? Yeah, I know how it goes. That game
1269960	1276360	literally it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it. I collect shit. I hoard
1276360	1282760	it all. Your wife pretty much hates reading books. She doesn't care. The only thing I
1282760	1287040	heard out of her like yesterday was, Oh, that's pretty, you know, cause you know, it's the
1287040	1291080	environment and stuff. It is pretty, but like, you know, I, I attacked a mammoth the other
1291080	1296920	day and stuff. I killed a couple of bears today. Yeah, they're pissing me off. Did you
1296920	1301760	find the cave of bears? Yes, they did find the cave of bears. Yes. I don't know if it
1301760	1304440	was, it's right outside one of the quest towns. There's actually, it's a place, it's called
1304440	1310120	like the bear cave or something like that. It's nothing but bears. There was two bears
1310120	1314200	in a cave that I found. I don't think it was that. It was on my way to, I don't remember
1314200	1318600	the damn town names. It's been a while. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anything else for your week
1318600	1322560	you want to share? Uh, that's it. All right. Um, my gaming week, actually not quite as
1322560	1327240	exciting as my co-host this week. I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week. Um, uh,
1327240	1332440	I wanted to get Mario Kart seven today, but I neglected to order online and now that I'm
1332440	1335720	trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it till after Christmas. I'm
1335720	1340920	like, screw you. Um, I want it now. I was literally next door to an evil G today and
1340920	1344360	I still didn't want to go in. I'm like, I'll wait till I'll go to target later in the week.
1344360	1349080	So yeah. Uh, no Mario Kart seven for me today, but um, I will get it this week. Just things
1349080	1351960	are a little bit crazy right now. As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier,
1351960	1356240	prepping for Thursday and, and just everything else going on with my day job is nuts right
1356240	1360700	now. Um, there hasn't been a whole lot of time. I will tell you what little time there
1360700	1365140	has been. I honestly truly have been spending on world of Warcraft because with good reason,
1365140	1369100	a huge content patch hit this week. The dark moon fair. Yeah. The four, three patch hit
1369100	1374180	this week, not just dark moon fair that started the other night, but the five man instances.
1374180	1378180	There's a new raid and now they have this whole new looking for Ray tool. So if you're
1378180	1382820	not even in a guild that raids regularly like mine kind of raids like half the time, um,
1382820	1386260	you can do this whole thing where you can raid now. So it's, it's great. There's a lot
1386260	1390000	of stuff you can do there. So my time has been kind of sucked away into world of Warcraft
1390000	1396460	and I talk more about it on this week's Horde house. That's the other show I do. www.hordehouse.com
1396460	1403100	check it out. Just posted earlier today. Um, so yeah, uh, other than that, I bought some
1403100	1407620	other games this week. I just haven't played them yet. I bought another one of those bundles.
1407620	1410960	It's not the humble indie bundle cause it wasn't really for charity, but it was another
1410960	1414940	bundle and uh, you'll have to forgive me. I forgot the name. Somebody in chat, I'm sure
1414940	1418680	will yell it out, but it's the bundle that had Cthulhu saves the world. It's like a big
1418680	1423260	something. Yeah. And then it had, it had a really big world bundle maybe. Yeah. It had
1423260	1428100	a really neat sounding game in it, which between that and the Xbox live indie games that I'd
1428100	1435200	played before, I knew it would be worth it. Um, it was, um, like poker mixed with puzzle
1435200	1439340	game mixed with RPG. It sounded really cool. So I wanted to play that. I just didn't get
1439340	1444440	around to it this week because again, new wow patch, busy day life. So it'd be awesome
1444440	1449860	if it's swords and poker for the PC, but they didn't. It is not swords and poker PC. So
1449860	1454440	that was another game took over my life. Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't
1454440	1459840	even get the answer for them. So we'll see. It'll come up in a little while I'm sure.
1459840	1465240	So the problem with those indie bundles, it's like I'm not buying anymore until I play the
1465240	1472060	one that I have and I've only played one game out of it. You know, VVVV. Um, I still haven't
1472060	1477400	played all the other ones out of that Humble Any Bundle. Um, so yeah, it probably will
1477400	1481580	be a while before I buy any more of those. Actually it was looking a little bit on Xbox
1481580	1486620	indie games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet and I thought
1486620	1491240	about buying some stuff. I almost bought DLC quest, but then I was like, how often would
1491240	1497240	I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff? So it'll be something I purchase
1497240	1501760	later on. All right, thank you guys. Thank you chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
1501760	1506560	It was, uh, Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle.
1506560	1510880	It's done. That was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it. I don't
1510880	1517480	know, but it's done. So unfortunately you can't buy this now, but um, let's see. Unless
1517480	1522160	maybe you can. Now the current minimum is done. It says or beat the minimum. I don't
1522160	1526520	know what the minimum is. I don't know if you can still buy it, but again, you look
1526520	1529960	down here and it says one minute, five seconds ago they were still selling it. So I don't
1529960	1535960	think you can. Well, let me try for dollars. Go see if it'll work. But anyway, the, uh,
1535960	1540040	it had, um, breath of death. Cthulhu saves the world. The game I was trying to think
1540040	1546100	of rune spell overture. That's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out.
1546100	1549600	So there you go. And sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore. I think
1549600	1557780	it's done so can't get it now. All right. Um, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you want
1557780	1564800	to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.
1564800	1569840	Awesome. Some other things we want to plug. You're old, right? I was talking about this
1569840	1573120	earlier and you were like, no, you're not old. It's like, no, I'm forgetting things
1573120	1578760	left and right. All right. Um, couple other things we wanted to mention before we get
1578760	1584600	into tonight's news. I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet. Twitter.com
1584600	1588400	slash O L R. If you want to follow us on Twitter, you can also send in your questions for tonight
1588400	1591680	because we'll get into Twitter topics a little later in the show. We get into part B. Our
1591680	1597080	Facebook is there as well. Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And now we are also on
1597080	1601580	Google plus so you can reach out and plus one us, uh, just search for orange lounge
1601580	1607000	radio on Google plus because I can't, there's no URLs on Google plus right now. So there
1607000	1612000	you go. Many ways you can interact with the show and talk to us and say hello and thank
1612000	1616040	God there will be a mailbag again next week. Um, hopefully as well if we're getting the
1616040	1620840	old website back, so that should be up midweek or so. All right, let's get into some gaming
1620840	1626840	news. Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight. Yes. Um, so lots of stuff
1626840	1631840	coming out about the PlayStation Vita. And of course one of the things that people are
1631840	1637520	wondering is how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us? Of course it's
1637520	1644520	going to be something reasonable, right? Right. Right. No. Um, actually no, they're, they're
1644640	1651640	pretty, pretty, um, high priced. Uh, let's see here. Or as you might say, not reasonable.
1652040	1658480	Yes. Not reasonable at all. Um, apparently they're saying that the according to GameStop
1658480	1663980	or the evil G if you will, uh, they have it listed on their website that the four gigabyte
1663980	1670520	card is going to be $29.99. Although they have, um, I guess Sony has told some websites
1670520	1675640	that the four gigabyte cards that actually retail for $24.99, uh, eight gigabyte cards
1675640	1681680	for $39.99. But, but I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell
1681680	1686120	stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it
1686120	1694120	listed for. Um, so beyond the four and eight gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will
1694120	1703640	run you $69.99 and 32 will be $119.99. Um, why is this important? Because they're required.
1703640	1709300	You need to have a memory card to play your games for the most part. Most games require
1709300	1714480	the memory card and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory
1714480	1719640	card in order to do that. And it's proprietary so you can't just, you know, get an SD card
1719640	1724480	or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper. But you know,
1724480	1729120	hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right? That's what their
1729120	1733720	fear is. Or they're going to hack the system somehow. I tell you this much, Sony, they're
1733720	1739480	going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have. It's
1739480	1745720	just going to happen. So I have to have a memory card and is Sony selling a bundle that
1745720	1750280	includes a memory card? They launched, they're going to have an launch bundles or whatever
1750280	1756040	that come with like a two gigabyte one I think. Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price
1756040	1761080	point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, Oh my God, I can't believe they're
1761080	1767540	releasing the Vita for 250. That is in fact a lie because 250 doesn't get you a memory
1767540	1772200	card. Am I correct? Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah. But some games do not require
1772200	1777560	it. Okay. Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves and they
1777560	1782400	also have storage for download content and stuff like that. Some other games require
1782400	1788040	memory cards for that storage as well. I was going to say, if these stupid things are required,
1788040	1792680	then the system's not really $250, is it? But because there is that little, you know,
1792680	1797560	we call that a new poll where it's like, okay, well really you can play some games without
1797560	1801560	one. Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360. Remember when they first released? You don't
1801560	1806840	have to get a hard drive, but you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever. But
1806840	1811960	they're a little ridiculous. And I mean, I understand the price of memory. I'm sorry,
1811960	1816960	that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards. Especially when everything else is
1816960	1821800	way cheaper. I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive
1821800	1829080	prices. I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120? I'm sorry, you can get a 250
1829080	1834520	gigabyte hard drive for probably about 30 bucks, if not cheaper than that. And it's
1834520	1838560	just such a high markup. And it's not anything really special either. It's just a laptop
1838560	1843840	hard drive formatted a special way, which you can get any laptop drive and format it
1843840	1847800	that special way if you have the right software to do that. Now, some of our folks in the
1847800	1851840	chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing. And so like
1851840	1856600	SSJ100 Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now about upwards from $350. And Alpha
1856600	1861920	Kinanagram is like, no, it's 250 plus 25. You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is
1861920	1866440	nice. Tiger Claw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video
1866440	1872740	player. And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD passport thing?
1872740	1878940	So if I let me get this right. If I want to play Luminous Old School all over again, assuming
1878940	1884320	it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is. I need to buy the right to
1884320	1889080	get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some
1889080	1893360	of these games on. Yes. Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game
1893360	1899560	would just cost me used anyway to just play on my old PSP. Yes. Logic doesn't apply and
1899560	1905860	when it comes to new video games, Rob, I know it's just, it's, it's so interesting to me
1905860	1911400	because what got everybody excited about the Vita? What truly got everybody like, fuck
1911400	1916040	yeah, Sony Vita. What got everybody really excited about it? The price, the back. It
1916040	1921160	was that price. No, it was not the back touch. It was not the reach around. It was that $250
1921160	1928320	price and now it's kind of like, oh, but it's, yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know,
1928320	1932880	oh, by the way, uh, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how
1932880	1938000	we were talking last week about Ridge Racer and there's, there's another thing to lose
1938000	1942320	a little excitement about the Vita over Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little
1942320	1950320	bit cheaper than your average average PlayStation game. It's $29.99 whereas your average going
1950320	1960960	costs for a Vita game is going to be $39.99. So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the
1960960	1967720	game. Fantastic. It's awesome. You know what? I'm going to save myself $30. I'm just not
1967720	1973920	going to buy that game. You know, I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am
1973920	1978840	a consumer whore and I want all the new toys, but I'm finding myself a little less excited
1978840	1982720	than I was a few months ago. I mean, at the end of the day, it's all about games. It is
1982720	1988660	all about the game. And if there is a truly like kick ass, oh my God, blow my mind game
1988660	1994520	on this thing. Like, you know, I got to say luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic.
1994520	1999600	There's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita, then you know, all this stuff seems
1999600	2004600	a little less worth waiting. Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that. You know,
2004600	2012480	being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything. It nets you a bunch of problems
2012480	2018080	and more expensive price point. That is it. What are you going to net? Oh, I get to play
2018080	2022280	some of these games early. Well, it's all generation one stuff. I mean, is there really
2022280	2026640	anything super fantastic? I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then a Uncharted
2026640	2031320	game might be worth it to you. I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan,
2031320	2037000	but I'm not buying Ridge Racer and I don't really care about a new, um, you know, Little
2037000	2041640	Big Planet game or ports of a bunch of older games, you know, like ultimate, you know,
2041640	2049840	Marvel versus Capcom three or, um, you know, UFC game, MMA stuff. Uh, I just don't care
2049840	2053880	that they're porting that stuff over right now. Our chat room is on fire. It is literally
2053880	2058420	burning with conversation on this whole thing. Uh, Alf Kananagram is talking about the bundle,
2058420	2063680	the PlayStation Vita first edition bundle, PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, four
2063680	2069440	gigabyte card and little deviance $349. God, I sound like a PR dude. I got to admit, not
2069440	2073400	all that stuff interests me. I'm, I'm probably going to want a card more than four gigabits
2073400	2077620	and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3g like I don't need it. I think they have
2077620	2081360	one that's without the 3g as well, but I'm not sure if that's available over here. I
2081360	2086840	think that's only in Canada. Go Canada. Tiger class says, what boggles me? Why only up to
2086840	2091400	32 gigabytes? We got memory sticks that go up to 64 gigabytes. I wish my phone had a
2091400	2096240	64 gig micro SD card. Then I could put all my music on it and use it as my primary music
2096240	2100800	player. Here's the problem though. If you're selling a memory stick or a memory card or
2100800	2104360	whatever you want to call it, that's the same price as the goddamn system. No one's going
2104360	2108440	to fucking there. Wait a second. I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised. All right,
2108440	2111640	one more comment. I'm going to get to hear from a private message. Usually I don't read
2111640	2116140	private messages cause I'm like talk in the main room, but I'll let me Klotov have this
2116140	2120440	one because he did guest on a whorehouse earlier today. So he did me a favor. But anyway, uh,
2120440	2123960	even though he only did a mediocre job, no, just kidding. Just kidding. I just want to
2123960	2127760	give him to all tab and say something angry. Uh, me. Klotov says rumor has it that the
2127760	2134160	memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus
2134160	2140440	retail box. Yeah, but here's the thing about that. That's all rumor and I don't know if
2140440	2145660	that's actually true or not. And on top of that, that all that is is just incentivize
2145660	2152600	you to buy the more expensive, you know, memory card because at the end of the day, you say
2152600	2157320	you buy like a four gig stick. What's that going to hold one or two games? I mean, that's
2157320	2163840	not going to offset the price of that memory card. All I have to say is the more and more
2163840	2169020	we talk about all this and oh, let, please let that 40% thing be true because once that
2169020	2184760	news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react.
2184760	2189600	The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen. Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy
2189600	2193960	GameStop included. Well, here's the thing is, well, how long is it until the Vita comes
2193960	2199320	out in Japan? I mean, isn't that like right around the corner? Yeah, it's like the 17th.
2199320	2203600	I thought the prices, the price points that they had for games on, I don't know if that's
2203600	2209760	just been announced yet, but I don't think it's going to be 40%. I think it's going to
2209760	2217520	be either the same price or just slightly under, not 40%. If it is 40% cool, you know,
2217520	2221480	then that way maybe it gets more people to buy this, you know, their games or whatever
2221480	2228400	or people just be more selective in what they buy. Alright, let's move on with another story.
2228400	2232360	This is also about Sony and this, I don't know what to think of this news and I think
2232360	2235920	a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either. There are
2235920	2243580	rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony. Ueda. Ueda, excuse me. He's quit Sony
2243580	2248560	and why is this important? Oh, he's the creative lead behind a Team Ico, which is creating
2248560	2253480	The Last Guardian. Remember The Last Guardian? Remember that? That was that game that showed
2253480	2258360	up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good
2258360	2265520	and then it was suddenly absent this year. And yeah, apparently he is left. The game
2265520	2269720	hasn't come out yet and it's like 2012 at this point. Maybe that explains why it was
2269720	2275440	supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not. Supposedly he is working on the
2275440	2281760	project still. He's freelancing. But yeah, interesting. Sony was asked to comment on
2281760	2290660	the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation. Right. Okay. Be interesting
2290660	2294320	to see how that impacts that game. I know, right? Especially if they announce it now
2294320	2300400	for the 360 and the Wii U. It's not. Maybe that's the surprise. It's not going to be
2300400	2308920	on the 360. It's on the Wii U! What about the Wii U, Loki? What about it? We haven't
2308920	2313760	seen anything that it actually does. Maybe that's the joke! If I take a big cardboard
2313760	2319440	box and write Wii U on it and then play a video next to it of all this amazing shit,
2319440	2325080	are people like, oh my god, I need to buy the Wii U! Look at all the shit it can do!
2325080	2330440	It doesn't do anything yet! It's just a video with some tech demos and shit. They don't
2330440	2335000	actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that
2335000	2338720	does something, but at E3 that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware. All I'm saying is that
2338720	2342720	if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you
2342720	2349360	Shadow of the Colossus and Aiko, comes the last guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just
2349360	2360720	be like, I don't give a fuck. This is what you're going to hear in the audience. It's
2360720	2365520	not going to go to any other platform other than Sony. I guarantee it. It's not going
2365520	2369320	to happen. He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit. It's
2369320	2376600	not fun to fantasize about. Who cares? I mean, yeah, people will be excited that it's coming
2376600	2382480	to another platform. He'll probably do something amazing later on. It'll be separate from all
2382480	2389440	this. Form his own game studio, and so on. Alright, let me reset Yackety Sax for the
2389440	2396320	next story, Dark Sakura. Xenoblade. Which, you know, they said, oh, no plans, no plans,
2396320	2406560	blah blah, it's getting released in the US. As a GameStop exclusive. Retail exclusive.
2406560	2418240	It's not just a GameStop. I know, but... Um, they said, Nintendo of America has said that
2418240	2427400	it's going to be out in April 2012. But I mean, why, why, why not have just already
2427400	2436200	put it out? It's in English. It's there. Why wait? Because, Dark Sakura, they have to
2436200	2447720	remove the Us and put the Zs back in. So what? So what? Okay, so... Excuse me, the Zeds.
2447720	2454280	And all the Zeds are now Zs. So Maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look
2454280	2461960	nonsensical. Americans won't understand it. So Yogurt has an H in it. Is there yogurt
2461960	2465760	in the Xenoblade Chronicles? I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.
2465760	2475480	There probably is yogurt. Just, you know what? Just for that, I'm still going to get the
2475480	2482640	British one. Look, I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this. No, I haven't
2482640	2487640	pre-ordered it. I haven't until April. Why, why pre-order it today? I am, I don't need
2487640	2491340	to pre-order this. Rob's got a little steam-plot over his head. I just, I do because I really
2491340	2497240	feel like, I feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to
2497240	2502880	fail? Yes. Have you ever heard that before? You're setting me up to fail. At work all
2502880	2507320	the time. I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying. It's a very, very thing
2507320	2510480	you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail. Yes, they do. We're not
2510480	2516920	a company that sets people up to fail. Yes, they do. Okay. I feel like this game is being
2516920	2528980	set up to fail. Yeah. And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic. I mean, for
2528980	2536240	a Wii game. It's, at the end of the day, a game is a game. And even though it's a really,
2536240	2542000	really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game, it's still a really good RPG that any
2542000	2546000	RPG fan needs to experience. For real. I mean, for real. I mean, so what if it doesn't have
2546000	2549800	the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff? We pimp classic games here on the show all
2549800	2553880	the time. It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games
2553880	2558320	in the slightest because this game does a lot. And like seriously, when you do play
2558320	2563460	it, you're like, this is a Wii game? Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.
2563460	2571120	And they should! But the problem is, I think we're, like, A, this game is coming out now.
2571120	2576640	It's like, the joke's over. And everybody's left the building. Like, like, a Loki said
2576640	2580760	earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox lube joke because it was a week old. Well, this
2580760	2585260	game is coming out, like, years after it came out in Japan at this point, right? It's gotta
2585260	2591040	be at least a year since it's out in Japan. At least six months from Europe, for sure.
2591040	2594240	And for what reason, we don't know. After everyone who already really wanted it has
2594240	2599200	pirated it at it. Pirated it at it. Let me put it this way. If you're translating from
2599200	2605440	English to English, English English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week
2605440	2613280	to finish that. I mean... It's called, um, Find and Replace. Yeah. I mean, I don't see
2613280	2617800	how that would be that difficult to go through there. And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the
2617800	2623120	words that's spelled in English English. Who cares? People are gonna be able to read it.
2623120	2626580	And you know what? Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was
2626580	2630780	misspelled in the first place. Or it's spelled correctly but just not in the way that we
2630780	2636400	may spell it correctly. Who gives a shit? You can understand it. So, so for one, it's
2636400	2641920	coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it. So
2641920	2645720	now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's gonna be honest about it and actually buy
2645720	2649640	the game if they pirated it. Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that
2649640	2653640	imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever. At least
2653640	2658720	they haven't said. I, I can't believe I came on this show and said, Nintendo's, they're
2658720	2662120	not gonna wait this long and then just re-release the same game. You'll get like Xenoblade Chronicles
2662120	2667360	Master Edition or International Edition. I'll have some extra stuff. Oops. Boy, did I give
2667360	2671760	somebody too much credit. Come on, Rob. I mean, this, this is a company that innovates
2671760	2676000	in every turn possible. I mean, they wouldn't, this isn't a company that would, I don't know,
2676000	2680480	take a Super NES ROM and put it on a CD and call it an anniversary edition or something
2680480	2684960	like that and sell it for $30 instead of putting it on the Virtual Console. No, they would
2684960	2688880	never do that. Ever. I mean, this isn't a company that tries to cash in. I really wanna
2688880	2693440	look at this translation. You know, you know what I mean. I bet it comes out and all that
2693440	2698880	shit is still in there. I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all. Yeah. So, what
2698880	2703720	do you wanna bet? We'll see, we'll see. But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release
2703720	2707800	thing. What does this tell you? If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only
2707800	2713080	get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really gonna do a lot of marketing behind
2713080	2716820	this. You're not gonna see Xenoblade TV commercials. You're not gonna see magazine ads really a
2716820	2720960	whole lot. Maybe onesie twosie here and there. GameStop might promote it a little bit. GameInformer
2720960	2723480	will probably have an ad for it. Oh, that's true. GameInformer will probably have it.
2723480	2728440	And they are a big magazine. But it's not gonna be quite that campaign you would see
2728440	2733160	behind old, say, Mario Kart 3DS or, you know, some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going
2733160	2738840	on right now. Which, it just seems like they're just gonna, ugh, hear. Well, it's all about,
2738840	2746960	you know, exposing themselves to loss. And they stay, I mean, history has shown with
2746960	2751400	games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's
2751400	2755120	not gonna sell very well. I mean, look at Mad World, look at, you know, even some of
2755120	2760480	the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff. It just, it, it
2760480	2764600	looks good. It could be really cutting edge as far as, you know, the technology behind
2764600	2768840	it or something like that. Or it can be really edgy, it's like a violent game and stuff.
2768840	2773800	But people, and hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell. And unfortunately, you know,
2773800	2780640	for Nintendo to publish this, and, you know, to bring it over here, I mean that, it's a
2780640	2785140	risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing, or, well, they're
2785140	2789400	not doing any marketing, but spend some money on, you know, another Mario Kart game or another
2789400	2794680	Mario game that they know they're gonna sell millions of copies of. But, at the same time,
2794680	2800840	you know, cause they kinda, they wanna not lose all their cred with, you know, hardcore
2800840	2805560	gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer. I mean, at least
2805560	2809560	that's what they're trying to, you know, this is how they're skewing it right now with saying,
2809560	2813840	look, Ninja Gaiden, or Ninja Gaiden's gonna be on. Look, hey, there's a Ghost Recon game
2813840	2817600	that's gonna be on. Hey, look, it's gonna have, you know, all these publishers backing
2817600	2821120	it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want, you know, the hardcore gamers to come
2821120	2827240	back. But, I think this game would have been better off having, like, an Atlus or an Ignition
2827240	2831860	or Exceed or something like that bring, this is a perfect game for something like Exceed
2831860	2835960	to bring over because this is the type of games they bring up. They bring over niche
2835960	2836960	RPGs.
2836960	2841680	Yeah, problem. Problem. It was developed by a Nintendo second party. So, can't happen.
2841680	2843440	All this makes me miss working designs.
2843440	2847120	Sure it can. It can, it can definitely happen. If they don't wanna publish it over here,
2847120	2849360	they can sell the rights to somebody else to publish it.
2849360	2850360	True.
2850360	2853360	But, here's what I think happened, and the reason why it's a GameStop exclusive, because
2853360	2855560	they backed money to bring it over here.
2855560	2859400	Yeah, that's what our chat's saying too. GameGuru in our chatroom says, GameStop probably paid
2859400	2865360	for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive. I just, I don't
2865360	2870600	know. I just, I worry at the end of the day it's not gonna sell as much as it should,
2870600	2874720	and then Nintendo's gonna say, well, this is why you can't have nice things. We were
2874720	2880880	gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall, and it didn't sell, so no last story
2880880	2882160	for you. Goodbye.
2882160	2885080	Here's why I say that. Fuck em. Because, you know what? I don't need them to bring out
2885080	2888720	fucking RPGs. They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want. Because, guess what?
2888720	2893720	This world has multiple publishers. It's just full of publishers that bring out RPGs, like
2893720	2899520	Atlas, or Exceed, or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs. And guess what? I don't
2899520	2904680	need you to fucking bring over anything. You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports game
2904680	2909280	games, your stupid, if there's another goddamn game with WooHoo Island in it, I don't give
2909280	2913800	a fuck if WooHoo Island is in there. It's not a landmark, it's not something like, oh
2913800	2918080	my god, this island's in here, it's such a character, as they put it. I don't fucking
2918080	2922480	care. Hey, why don't you put WooHoo Island in fucking, you know, Xenoblade or whatever,
2922480	2926800	because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are gonna want to see that. And hell, Mario's
2926800	2930240	a playable character, since, you know, it's a Nintendo published game, it's gotta have
2930240	2931720	fucking Mario in it.
2931720	2932720	Mamma mia.
2932720	2937560	So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't bring it out of here. And if they're
2937560	2942640	like, we listen to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through, well, fuck you, you
2942640	2946520	know what, because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit,
2946520	2950480	and sure, people are gonna cream themselves over goddamn Zelda, and to be fair-
2950480	2956960	Well, I was gonna say, hold on, hold on, because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward
2956960	2961280	Sword? Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing, I haven't played it myself. But that
2961280	2966920	Mario 3DS game, I will tell you first hand, is that good.
2966920	2972880	Okay? To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy. It's not a
2972880	2976840	Xenoblade. It's a different type of game. It's an adventure game, if you will. It's
2976840	2982080	not an RPG. It's an adventure game. It's a different type of game altogether. See, this
2982080	2988280	is- if that was the case, if, you know, hey, we're looking for some adventure games to
2988280	2991640	satisfy our fans, then boom, there you go. You have your game right there. You have your
2991640	2993080	good Mario games.
2993080	2998240	But Nintendo does this stuff where they have brilliant ideas, and they implement them really
2998240	3003240	well once, and then they just forget that they ever did it again. Perfect example. Excite
3003240	3007560	Truck for the Wii when it first came out. Utilize the SC memory card slot, because everyone's
3007560	3012580	like, holy shit, you know, we can play our own music on there. And then they never did
3012580	3017240	it again. Oh, oh, I am sorry, they did it once in Endless Ocean, but who gives a fuck?
3017240	3022560	No one bought Endless Ocean. It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game. If I want to go snorkeling,
3022560	3027120	I will go outside and go snorkeling. I don't need to play a game to simulate that. But
3027120	3032600	that was, like, the two times that they ever used that stupid SC memory card slot for anything
3032600	3033960	other than, later on, game sets.
3033960	3036700	This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?
3036700	3041160	It's because they do stupid shit, because now everyone's like, oh, look, look, Project
3041160	3046680	Grainfall worked! No, no, they did it so they could save face, so they're like, see? We
3046680	3051200	care about the hardcore gamer. Buy the Wii U. We're gonna put out hardcore games for
3051200	3054920	it. Then you buy the Wii U, and you're gonna get fucking Mario games, and more fucking
3054920	3059040	Mario games, and more fucking Mario games, and more Mario games. Oh, and there's gonna
3059040	3062880	be a Zelda there, because, you know, that's a hardcore game now, and maybe a Metroid that's
3062880	3063880	gonna suck.
3063880	3069440	Can I go? I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting. And rdgsinge
3069440	3076420	in our chatroom says, the new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year. I'm not
3076420	3079760	sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you gotta read into it, and
3079760	3084280	it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games? And I think you can, but
3084280	3088640	certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about? And I gotta say,
3088640	3093600	I do hear probably as many people, if not more, talking about Skyrim than I am hearing
3093600	3097320	about Zelda. Just kind of like on the average, on my Facebook feed, in real life, people
3097320	3102600	I know that wouldn't go to the extent to read gaming news or download gaming podcasts but
3102600	3107820	still spend money on video games are playing a lot of Skyrim. But I am hearing some Zelda
3107820	3113840	2, but it seems like five years ago, when it was Twilight Princess, that was all anybody
3113840	3116120	could talk about. Nobody shared the stage.
3116120	3119480	That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good
3119480	3123060	games. And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever,
3123060	3128000	and some other good Wii games. But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or
3128000	3131580	sold their Wii, because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to
3131580	3132580	play anymore.
3132580	3133580	That's my Wii.
3133580	3139200	You know, so it's like, well, who cares? And also, Skyward Sword, one system. Skyrim on
3139200	3143680	a bunch of systems and PCs. So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking
3143680	3147320	about it. But once again, RPG adventure game. Different. Completely different.
3147320	3149440	Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.
3149440	3153480	It's definitely not for Grandma. I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal
3153480	3158040	to a lot of people. And to be honest, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind
3158040	3163780	of a risky move for them. I mean, if you think about it, their big thing was, let's get non-gamers
3163780	3169000	into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.
3169000	3174220	Yeah, but there's a problem. They were non-gamers for a reason. They don't play games. And yeah,
3174220	3180080	they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii party didn't sell
3180080	3185640	very well, because no one buys games that are non-gamers.
3185640	3188640	Xenoblade may have sold well for some of the stuff, because once again, you're convincing
3188640	3191960	them it's a party game. But Skyward Sword, not a party game. Not really anything that
3191960	3197000	non-gamers are going to be interested in. It is kind of, you know, hey, fans of the
3197000	3201240	series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey, we're still considering
3201240	3207720	you. And it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform.
3207720	3214560	But at the same time, I just, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever,
3214560	3218240	I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care. I'm not going to buy it. I mean, especially
3218240	3221320	when they said GameStop, I'm like, really not going to buy it.
3221320	3224640	I gotta be honest. Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on
3224640	3228480	Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April. I am leaning towards, I think I might
3228480	3236200	buy it. It's a good game at the end of the day, despite my displeasure of how they're
3236200	3241000	fucking this up. I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein
3241000	3246200	the Dark Sakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff
3246200	3249800	she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on. It's just kind of
3249800	3253000	one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a
3253000	3255160	piece of gaming history. Well, we have almost everything that Working
3255160	3258640	Designs put out. Same thing. It's kind of one of those things.
3258640	3262220	Let me word it in a different way then. I'm not fucking begging any goddamn publishers
3262220	3268080	for a fucking game. So you know what? You're here, publishers, to please me as a consumer.
3268080	3272880	And if you want me to fucking beg and plead to give you money, then you can go fuck yourself
3272880	3277360	because I'm not doing that. And hey, Nintendo, with your Wii U, if it sucks balls, I'm not
3277360	3281560	fucking buying it. Or in your goddamn Mario games that come out of there. And yeah, I'll
3281560	3286260	give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. It'll use probably the touch pad for some other
3286260	3291000	goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for. Whatever. I don't care. Yeah, I may get
3291000	3295160	in on 3DS. But I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that
3295160	3300420	has all these classic tracks. What if the Mario game is really good? Like
3300420	3304640	Mario 3DS Land. Or whatever the hell it's called. Super Mario 3D Land.
3304640	3309480	One game on a console does not warrant me buying that console. If it's good. It has
3309480	3312980	to be the majority of the games on the console being good. And I'm sorry if there's other
3312980	3317120	things on other consoles, especially cross console stuff, I'm gonna get it on a console
3317120	3321280	that, you know, I don't have to pay extra money for to get some... I mean, like, come
3321280	3326080	on. Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo. And a lot of games have sold me the systems. You
3326080	3331660	know, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation. It's true, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation.
3331660	3335480	There was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii. But you know what? I bought the
3335480	3342880	Wii and I played some of those games and... haven't really touched it since. Played a
3342880	3350040	little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back, but... I mean, I kinda was like, eh.
3350040	3353080	It's kind of a waste of my money. And I don't wanna make that mistake again.
3353080	3356320	Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on, but I'm sure we'll get lots of emails
3356320	3359840	on it this week. Oh wait, you can't email us. Actually, no. The email should be fixed
3359840	3365840	mid-week. So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again. Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.
3365840	3369720	Meanwhile, we got more news to cover, so I'm gonna go back to Loki.
3369720	3376760	Alright. So let's see here. Let's talk a little bit about... this is kinda cool. And I actually
3376760	3382960	had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind
3382960	3389120	of reinviged it. There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind
3389120	3397600	some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which
3397600	3400080	I'm not too familiar with those games, but...
3400080	3402880	Cause they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.
3402880	3407680	Yes, and it was funny, cause it was one of my co-workers, who's a friend of one of the
3407680	3414000	guys at the company, which I gotta talk to that co-worker later on this week. He's like
3414000	3420040	saying, hey, have you heard these guys? I saw them. They're just down the street from
3420040	3426520	my house. I wonder if you've heard of any of these games or whatever. And I was like,
3426520	3433480	I haven't heard anything. But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware
3433480	3441840	and EA. I guess they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high-quality
3441840	3450280	RPG titles to a fast-growing, highly-engaged, core gamer crowd. And they're also planning
3450280	3456200	on bringing stuff to social platforms like Facebook and stuff. So maybe seeing Bioware
3456200	3460840	games on Facebook. Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there on, well
3460840	3464760	I haven't seen it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook too. Yeah, so more like that
3464760	3471200	type of game on, you know, cause that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.
3471200	3475040	And so it's Bioware Sacramento now, that's kind of cool. Yeah, cause that's where we,
3475040	3478560	if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered, is in Sacramento.
3478560	3481560	I did a little investigative journalism, if you will. I just wanted to figure out where
3481560	3484760	these guys were located. I wanted to know if they were downtown or if they were in the
3484760	3489360	suburb. Well, do you know where they are downtown? I found this fascinating. I actually, because
3489360	3494000	their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is. So I
3494000	3503920	Googled it and put it in the maps. Guess what they are next door to? The Depot. Oh, fun.
3503920	3510160	Do you know what the Depot is, our international audience? It's the Gay Bar downtown. The Gay
3510160	3515480	Bar. No, there's well that it's, it's right at the corner of the kind of where all the
3515480	3521280	gay bars are down there. So, uh, I think it's hilarious. Bioware Sacramento, Bioware is
3521280	3526760	now officially next door to a gay bar, which, you know, it's just whatever, but it's, it's
3526760	3530060	just kind of funny because, you know, especially Bioware has also been kind of one of the leading
3530060	3536200	companies in kind of breaking down that barrier and a lot of their storytelling too, you know,
3536200	3540960	obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff. Um, Alan's tried and they've got positions
3540960	3544740	on the website and I think a lot of it's like design stuff too. So you really should. Yeah,
3544740	3550080	you should look into that. So in fact, we should, gosh, now there's like gaming companies
3550080	3555520	starting to pop up here. There's, there's us, there's Bioware Sacramento, there's the
3555520	3559560	Prima Games. People are actually here too. The strategy guys that come out of there.
3559560	3567640	We need to like have a, have a luncheon. I have a short luncheon. Hi two people. We need
3567640	3571800	to rent out the back room at the spaghetti factory, which is across the street from Bioware
3571800	3578440	Sacramento. Sacramento's not on the website yet. No, but they go to their old name, the
3578440	3582480	click nation or whatever it's on there. But a lot of that's probably changed. Oh yeah,
3582480	3589280	I applied with them before as click nation. Yeah. So there you go. A little more gaming
3589280	3593000	movie and moving into our backyard. That's pretty cool. Anyone all said and done? Yeah.
3593000	3598320	So good luck to them. I mean, I, I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but you
3598320	3602240	know, especially with, here's where I could see kind of this going. You know, a lot of
3602240	3607440	people very excited about the old Republic, which Bioware is a part of. If they can find
3607440	3612080	the way to the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think there'll
3612080	3615860	be a step ahead of Warcraft because World of Warcraft, you know, yeah, they've kind
3615860	3620440	of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great. They just kind of published like, Hey,
3620440	3623520	my character got this achievement and Hey, look at this 3d model of my character. And
3623520	3628640	it always seems to break whenever there's new patch. So, you know, Blizzard has not
3628640	3632820	been interfacing with Facebook very well. So this is a chance where Bioware could maybe
3632820	3638920	get a step up. So who knows that these will be the guys to do it or not. So pretty cool.
3638920	3644440	Fun stuff going on in the backyard. All right. Um, moving on. Lots of reports coming out
3644440	3649200	of black Friday sales. Of course, black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving
3649200	3653800	here in the U S because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day. And
3653800	3659680	now some of the sales numbers are in apparently and Loki will love this. Uh, following up
3659680	3663960	with the rants, he was just saying there, Nintendo of America in an interview with USA
3663960	3669400	today mentioned that super Mario 3d land has become the fastest selling portable Mario
3669400	3674320	game ever. Wait a minute. How many portable Mario games have there been? There was Mario
3674320	3680600	land on the game boy. There was, yeah, but those are all rehashes. They never really
3680600	3685240	did a proper Mario game on the advance specifically made for the advance. Did they, they don't
3685240	3689960	think they're going to count that anyway. Yeah. Mario Kart. Yeah. So I don't know. Anyway,
3689960	3694960	so whatever it is, the fastest selling game ever. It moved half a million copies since
3694960	3702520	November 13th. 3ds system sales are, are up way up to system sales up 325% for the week
3702520	3708740	of November 20th. Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.
3708740	3714880	The we had its biggest black Friday ever. Half a million systems sold on black Friday
3714880	3721080	alone. They needed that cause they were not selling well at all. The legend is Zelda skyward
3721080	3729860	sword 535,000 copies. Fastest selling Zelda in history. There you go. Lots of stuff coming
3729860	3735760	out of Nintendo, Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too. They moved almost a million
3735760	3740760	Xbox three sixties on the week of black Friday. They don't say specifically back Friday, but
3740760	3749000	like just under a million three sixties, 750,000 connects that same week. I I'm kind of surprised
3749000	3752520	that the connect had such a huge year. There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on the
3752520	3756280	connect right now except maybe like Dan central twos. There's a lot of games out for the connect
3756280	3761920	though. A lot of games out. A lot of, not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are
3761920	3765480	out, but there's some good stuff. I had to giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox
3765480	3771200	website because they're like connect for core like as in hardcore gamers and they have like
3771200	3775840	a picture of four zone there. I'm like because it is head tracking has some voice commands
3775840	3781240	that's hardly connect game and just dance three, which is a connect game, but this is
3781240	3786120	a franchise that was really popular on the we between November 20th and 26 just dance
3786120	3797560	three sold 700,000 copies. Lots Abba. You can dance. No, uh, no, uh, sales figures on that
3797560	3803680	just right now, but I'm telling you, I didn't talk about that game the other week. Oh, it's
3803680	3809760	fabulous. Oh, Rob, dark soccer. Watched me play Abba. You can dance on the way and I
3809760	3816280	got to say the gayest thing I've ever seen. There was a song. It's really something. There
3816280	3820400	was a song. You got it. You got to see it. You got to have a ballerina. Yeah. And Rob
3820400	3825200	was trying to go in point. You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs and he
3825200	3828040	has like a little ballerina on the screen. So you have to kind of do a little ballerina
3828040	3833360	dance. Hilarious. Um, I think it was the winner takes it all or something. It was Fernando.
3833360	3838140	Maybe I don't know. Whatever. Yeah, no, it was the winner takes it all. I think cause
3838140	3847320	it's a slow song. You know, I had to do the hand sweepy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Anyhow. Oh
3847320	3852840	God. That was, I have, why isn't Abba you can dance on connect? Anyway, blurry photos
3852840	3857640	of Rob that better not end up on the internet. I will destroy you. I'm going to call you
3857640	3863000	dance. Squatch. All right. You know, cause every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.
3863000	3866400	Shush. All right. Uh, let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel around
3866400	3870240	the world and check out games coming out soon. Although it's probably dried up quite a bit
3870240	3876280	moving past black Friday now. Uh, yeah, it's usually, uh, December is quite a dead month.
3876280	3880280	In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are
3880280	3885400	probably going to be just a couple titles. But this week we had a Mario Kart seven. Well
3885400	3890720	today that's on the three DS fortune street coming out on the Wii this week. Uh, Jaws
3890720	3897600	ultimate predator on the Wii and three DS face racers photo finish on the three DS nano
3897600	3904440	assault on the three DS. Uh, Ubisoft is releasing their own tablet thing to compete with you.
3904440	3913760	Draw the draw some tablet that's coming out. Yeah, it's, it's awesome. Um, outdoors unleashed
3913760	3921600	Africa and Alaska coming out on three DS, uh, just dance three on the PlayStation three
3921600	3926760	finally coming out for the PlayStation move. The adventures of Tintin the game on Xbox
3926760	3932880	three 60 PlayStation three we and the three DS. No one Kirk her. I care about 10, 10 bar.
3932880	3936980	Just know the game will be garbage. It's the game doesn't look like garbage. It's actually
3936980	3941160	kind of a neat little adventure game. Just not talking about what a, whoa, whoa, whoa,
3941160	3946120	wait, wait. Interruption. Amiga seven seven seven says it's been reported that for me
3946120	3956760	to confirm to connect, we make a blue stinger formula one 2011 for the three DS, the Oregon
3956760	3965240	trail for the Wii and three DS this week. Hell yeah. And, uh, I think my we died of
3965240	3971640	dysentery actually. I believe that is it. All right, then let's move on to Japan and
3971640	3976000	talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there
3976000	3981200	this week on December the eighth on the Xbox three 60 Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast connect
3981200	3985320	Disneyland adventures. Michael Jackson, the experience, boy, that game has been out here
3985320	3988620	a while, but you're finally getting in Japan this week in regular and limited editions
3988620	3996120	and the elder scrolls. Skyrim comes out in Japan this week. I can't imagine they've localized
3996120	4000840	everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the, uh, you know, menus and things.
4000840	4005840	I don't know, but that's, um, interesting. They are bringing that out in Japan. Um, by
4005840	4010760	the way, next week, huge release final fantasy 13 to this is Japan again. I know we're getting
4010760	4015960	it early next year. PlayStation three on December the eighth beyond the future fix the time
4015960	4021060	arrow in regular limited edition Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast. Michael Jackson, the experience
4021060	4025560	need for speed, the run Japan's edition as well as the elder scrolls Skyrim there as
4025560	4030280	well. I actually did all the voice acting stuff in Japanese. Did they really? Yeah,
4030280	4034280	they have a lot. They have a trailer that shows it there. It was one, I think it was
4034280	4038840	on Kotaku. They were saying, which trailer is most or which language trailer is the most
4038840	4048680	epic? And they had a Japanese and German and French and whole bunch of stuff. Um, I'm just
4048680	4053040	trying, I'm searching the YouTube's right now. Let's see the elder scrolls five Skyrim
4053040	4057480	Japan trailer. I better not get trolled with this YouTube link. Let's see. We are live
4057480	4077080	folks. Let's see. I'm feeling moved already. I don't know about you guys. There's not a
4077080	4097840	lot of talking.
4097840	4114160	God, this game is really good. I actually do have to say that that's an example of the
4114160	4117960	Japanese voice acting. It sounds really good. They could be reading this in pig Latin and
4117960	4122800	I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic. Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire
4122800	4126640	thing, but there you go. Wow. I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.
4126640	4131120	So props to them. That's really something else. All right. Also on the PlayStation three
4131120	4136600	this week, wizardry perfect pack comes out this week. That's a role playing game. I wonder
4136600	4141560	if that ties into the old ass wizardry series for back in the day. It probably does. Um,
4141560	4147280	let's see on other systems, the PlayStation Vita not out just yet. That is December 17th,
4147280	4151820	but otherwise anything on the Wii this week, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic
4151820	4155320	games and Michael Jackson, the experience and need for speed. The run, all the versions
4155320	4159720	on the Wii are out this week as well. Let me check the 3ds lastly real quick. Ah, world
4159720	4164120	soccer winning 11 2012 soccer games are usually pretty big over there and looks like on a
4164120	4169640	special release day, the 10th of December, this might be slightly a big G big deal. Monster
4169640	4174380	Hunter 3g. That's right. The Monster Hunter 3ds game is out. People are going to be piled
4174380	4180720	outside waiting for it. That's slightly a big deal who will be in line. Yeah. Freaking
4180720	4187320	Monster Hunter. All right. Two games in the UK. All right. What on the ninth dizzy Prince
4187320	4192760	of yolk folk on the iPhone and Android and just dance three for PlayStation three. There
4192760	4200700	you go. All right. Dark soccer. More gaming news please. Well, um, I don't know if Alan
4200700	4206680	knows about this. He does. I trolled him with it already. Well, a valve employee was spotted
4206680	4215480	wearing a half-life three shirt and the person that took the picture, um, John Donna, I think
4215480	4220560	is how it's pronounced. Um, took, asked permission to take the picture too and put it on his
4220560	4228520	Twitter. So, um, it's a big half-life logo with the three. Yeah. I want to create an
4228520	4236240	actual shirt that has half-life four on it. Just saying that, you know, um, here's the
4236240	4239840	thing is that a lot of people are going like, OMG and rightfully so like this game needs
4239840	4244160	to just fucking happen already. But at the same time, valve is totally not above trolling
4244160	4249460	people and like this whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling. But, um, I hope
4249460	4253880	it's true. I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true.
4253880	4260800	Um, but, uh, the problem is it could also be a joke. So I mean, is this something that
4260800	4264440	valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce or they probably would want to
4264440	4269620	show off the new engine obviously because it would, it would be a new engine. So I imagine
4269620	4273000	I guess if it's real, maybe, maybe something early next year. Cause you know, what else
4273000	4277520	is valve working on right now that we know of the dota game? That's about whatever. Yeah.
4277520	4282600	I'm going to put a picture up on our tumbler. All right. And a salacious pop or Alan is
4282600	4287800	in our chat right now saying shaking and crying, shaking and crying. I'm there with, I hope
4287800	4294480	it's true. I, I, a lot of people, if it's true, then I'll need new underwear. All right.
4294480	4301840	Valve tried to give us all a little bit of warning. All right. Uh, Loki. All right. Um,
4301840	4310260	so let's see here. This is a kind of a annoying, I guess. You remember how some of these publishers
4310260	4315680	are doing online passes? Well, EA being the first out of the gate with the whole online
4315680	4320300	passing as part of their project. $10. Well, there's a little something, something that
4320300	4326800	they forgot to mention to you that's in the end user license agreements. You may not have
4326800	4332920	seen those online passes can expire. That's right. Um, apparently there is a guy that
4332920	4340280	was, um, part of the, uh, new, uh, games are fun, uh, forum. And he posted that his copy
4340280	4345000	of EA's, uh, need for speed hot pursuit contained the online pass that was expired blocking
4345000	4350400	him from accessing, or accessing online content. And, uh, I guess there's a bunch of the people
4350400	4357520	that were saying that they ran into the same problem. And, uh, EA, uh, actually came out
4357520	4363040	and said EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of
4363040	4370640	online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly. Um, and it
4370640	4375760	apparently is as a rule, no online pass should expire, but a few titles will have a time
4375760	4381880	limit on their use, even new purchases. Um, and dragon H2 for example, has an online pass
4381880	4390440	that expires March 31st, 2012. Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement,
4390440	4396200	it's actually listed in there and says redownloading or getting a new pass is free. EA said, I'm
4396200	4400760	not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the
4400760	4407720	old pass and it somehow changes the date or something. Um, and it's weird though that
4407720	4414240	they have, you know, they have this in the first place. Why, why even make these expired
4414240	4430080	to begin with? I don't understand why they would do that. Wait for it. Wait for it. Do
4430080	4440440	I really need to say anything else? I mean, yeah, I just, I just don't understand why,
4440440	4445280	why they would do that in the first place. I mean, that would be like, for example, if
4445280	4448940	you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically
4448940	4455000	these passes act like download content and it expires. Hey, hey, you know, you like playing
4455000	4463920	that Skyrim DLC. Hope you finished all your quests in it because it's expired. Unfortunately,
4463920	4472600	we made it out of meat. It's no good anymore. You can't consume this download content. You
4472600	4486080	will get sick. I mean, it's just it. I know. I know. I, what else needs to be said? It's
4486080	4490840	just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting
4490840	4497040	punished over and over again. And it's like, when is this shit going to stop? Oh, and they
4497040	4502800	even said that apparently, uh, Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and even says on the
4502800	4510680	actual card, it says, uh, the, was it the service network, whatever, um, activation.
4510680	4518560	And it says it's code expires January 1st, 2012. So if you're planning on buying Mass
4518560	4527720	Effect 2, I hope you use that code already. SMH. That's all I have to say. SMH. Moving
4527720	4533280	on. You know, wait, no, not moving on. You know, in California we have this law and I
4533280	4536520	think some other states have it too. And so federal has certain protections about it.
4536520	4542800	But like, like if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate
4542800	4549620	to the movie theater for his birthday. Okay. And he never uses it, but like three years
4549620	4556140	later he finds it. It's still worth $25. They can't deduct fees. They, if he wants to take
4556140	4560400	it in for certain amounts, I think it's like up to 10 or $25. He can actually go in and
4560400	4563960	say, I want the cash back. Then they have to give him the money for it. Like they have
4563960	4571920	to do that. So, um, it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole
4571920	4576720	kind of around this where things can't, that are worth money like this can expire. I'm
4576720	4580440	going to tell you something else though. In the state of California, gift cards don't
4580440	4587920	expire. Oh yeah, yeah. So why is this stuff expire? I don't think it actually legally
4587920	4592000	would be able to in the state. They're not, see, but there's, it's not real money, quote
4592000	4596320	unquote. The online pass technically has no value. It does and it doesn't. It's, it's,
4596320	4601000	to me it seems like a legal loophole. The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it,
4601000	4606600	but you've still bought the pass. You've still bought the card, but you didn't really buy
4606600	4612640	the pass. It was included with your new game. It still has a monetary value attached to
4612640	4616040	it. They're not, it's nothing that's going to be a game has a monetary value. The past
4616040	4622080	actually does have a monetary value. You didn't buy the game. Let's, I don't agree. I don't
4622080	4627560	agree with what I'm saying. I'm just being there. No, but it's nothing that would stand.
4627560	4631040	Let's just look at it this way. Okay. What is, what are these passes trying to prevent
4631040	4636200	anyways? Piracy and use game sales. Okay. That's what they're, they're trying to prevent
4636200	4641840	with these things. What are they encouraging with all this stuff expiring piracy and use
4641840	4646640	game piracy? No. Well, here's the thing though. Pirates, I'm telling you pirates, it's not
4646640	4652500	a big deal because guess what? Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these
4652500	4656480	online passes that you happen to throw in their way. Guess what? You can download any
4656480	4663680	DLC for free. Now granted, if, you know, Mass Effect 2 or whatever, that's not a big deal.
4663680	4667680	And you can't play online with, you know, a JTAG system or something like that, but
4667680	4671660	you can download all the download content. For example, Saints Row the Third. If you're
4671660	4676400	ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend
4676400	4681980	that may have, you know, a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version
4681980	4686200	of that online pass download content that works just fine. Of course, legitimate consumers
4686200	4691640	that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what? THQ wants
4691640	4697280	to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares. Or they
4697280	4702680	can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle. It's just
4702680	4708560	a little minor inconvenience, I guess. I mean, and does it stop some use game sales? Maybe
4708560	4712800	it does. I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in
4712800	4717920	tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like
4717920	4726600	that. It's not the way to go about it. I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone
4726600	4733680	decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January. Let's say they go and buy it in January and
4733680	4737320	they got this code, hey, sweet, I can get this free download content. And you go put
4737320	4742840	it in, code invalid, it's expired. I mean, when they kind of leave a little sour taste
4742840	4747160	in your mouth, wouldn't you think twice before buying a EA product again? And let's just
4747160	4751360	say they bought it. Brand new, because I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.
4751360	4757760	Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.
4757760	4764360	I mean, that would kind of annoy me. That would be like, maybe, what? Well, you should
4764360	4772560	have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier. I mean, thanks. What I think it
4772560	4778560	comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of
4778560	4781540	when they're going to drop prices of these things and you see they work in the price
4781540	4785520	of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60. Oh, now we're going
4785520	4788400	to drop it down to $20 and we're going to take the download vote.
4788400	4791520	No, not, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually. I think you're giving them
4791520	4794720	too much credit to plan ahead. I think that's exactly what happened here is that people
4794720	4798640	didn't plan ahead. And I think that's what's really happening here is somebody put the
4798640	4801840	cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well,
4801840	4805000	what about when these things expire? And then when that point came up, somebody just said,
4805000	4815440	ah, fuck them. So that's what happens in boardrooms across America. Fuck them. Moving on, Verizon.
4815440	4821320	I wanted to say fuck them too. Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon,
4821320	4824140	but if not, well, fuck them too. But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about
4824140	4827360	Verizon because this sounds like it could be interesting. You know that whole streaming
4827360	4832200	TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360. Well, Verizon FiOS, I don't know what that is because
4832200	4835040	we don't have this here. I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse.
4835040	4846040	It's FiOS. It's fiber optic. Okay. Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels
4846040	4852560	from this to your Xbox 360. If you are an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get
4852560	4858520	the FiOS TV and internet service. So in other words, as long as you could just turn on your
4858520	4863120	TV and get these channels, now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have
4863120	4872480	gold as well. And you'll get 26 of the channels. I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome,
4872480	4880040	but everybody's reporting on it anyway. No, I'm with you because I, as far as, you know,
4880040	4883720	you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect. I don't care. That's something
4883720	4893880	your TV can't do. Once again, Xbox P break. Once again, why do I need to do that? Okay.
4893880	4900080	I'm telling you in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote
4900080	4905080	faster than someone can say pause. I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference
4905080	4916520	there. Xbox pause. Did you ask for a puppy? No. Xbox pause. You want to watch jaws? Xbox
4916520	4930320	pause. It's just cannot identify you. Please face sensor. You're not old enough to watch
4930320	4940400	this programming. Here's the thing. I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for
4940400	4946880	stuff in addition to my cable company. Or like, for example, say if I'm ever so inclined
4946880	4953800	to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point? If
4953800	4959520	I have to have cable to watch TV, I'm going to do it without an Xbox. I don't need to
4959520	4965920	buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV. Chat room to the rescue. The show where every gamer
4965920	4970780	has a voice. Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this. Alpha Kinetogram in the chat.
4970780	4978500	If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one. Something
4978500	4987440	for the kids room. Loki, would he retort? I can just get another box and okay, that's
4987440	4995240	great. That's great. We can do that, I suppose. Um, but at the same time, I mean, I only watch
4995240	5002960	TV in one room. I don't need that. What about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV
5002960	5008760	in his room? Then he can watch TV in his room because by then I'm sure we'll have something
5008760	5014280	better than the Xbox streaming. Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream
5014280	5020600	cable, we got a problem. I mean, hell, you can, you can get like dish installed like
5020600	5025680	four receivers or whatever. I'm not going to do that. Like they always say, but we could
5025680	5029920	install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms. Like I'm only
5029920	5035000	one person. I can watch TV in one room at a time. I don't need four receivers. Why am
5035000	5040800	I going to want, Hey wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.
5040800	5048020	Yeah. You know what? I have the internet. Fuck receivers. I'm already paying for a high
5048020	5053920	speed internet. That's my DVR. I can watch shit whenever I want on any system. And I
5053920	5058200	like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your like iPod and stuff like, well,
5058200	5061400	first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small till then you'll watch TV show
5061400	5067680	on my iPod. But um, yeah, it's kind of cool that they have it. Now if I could use my Xbox
5067680	5072280	360 as a DVR to DVR those programs and watch them later on, then yes, that would be an
5072280	5076040	added value. That would be fucking awesome. But they're not going to do that because then
5076040	5081560	that means cable company doesn't get money. Um, so they're of course not going to do that.
5081560	5086680	So watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal. Now here's the
5086680	5090600	thing though that would interest me is if they're in HD because I currently don't pay
5090600	5095640	for the HD package because I chose to go the route. I was actually going to go the route
5095640	5100800	of no cable, but they said, Hey, for $2 extra, we can give you cable. And I'm like, okay,
5100800	5109400	two bucks. I can do that. $2. But it's actually, it's the additional stuff on top of like channels
5109400	5113760	that are not on my TV that I'm interested in. Like if they have like gaming channels
5113760	5119480	or something like ESPN Ocho, the Ocho. Now if they have additional stuff, that's kind
5119480	5124800	of what I'm interested in as far as like the stuff that's offered from Verizon or dish
5124800	5130680	or direct TV or whatever. Maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently
5130680	5138360	powered on. How about that? Wouldn't that be something? You know what? JD Ross major
5138360	5143700	now Ross is not working. Major. Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.
5143700	5151840	Think about it. Could be the major Nelson hour majors could be the major Nelson channel.
5151840	5158960	Just camera fixed on major Nelson all day long majors mini series. Maybe dark Sakura.
5158960	5165960	We need another news story please. Um, animal crossing. This one's actually kind of different.
5165960	5173040	Yeah, they say that now, but um, you actually play as the mayor and you can customize your
5173040	5177240	town and you have a secretary. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Now I'm the mayor. Now you're
5177240	5182280	the mayor. Do people have to do what I say? Probably. You also have a secretary named
5182280	5190360	Shizu and uh, the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike
5190360	5194720	so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently
5194720	5201120	too. And your clothes, you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts. So now that I'm
5201120	5207280	the mayor, will I be able to evict Tom Nook? I wish. Well you have to deal with problems.
5207280	5213440	Like will all the animals like start occupying on your front lawn happen? We've got, am I
5213440	5220440	going to have to send out, um, Rossetti to mace the villagers of the town? Can I finish
5220440	5227200	my story? Hands on mayor. I'm going to take this shit in my own hand. Grab a shovel. Well,
5227200	5240120	hit the bug net. It's time to discipline people. Can I finish reading my story, Rob? No. Okay.
5240120	5244420	Rob shaking and crying. He's looking forward to this so much. I just wish somebody other
5244420	5249960	than Nintendo would make these games cause then they might be really funny. Well, you've
5249960	5255280	got a furniture shop where you can design your own cushions for your furniture. Uh,
5255280	5260360	you can make changes to your home exterior. You have fence posts, mailbox, basically
5260360	5266600	it's like the Sims with animals, but different. Uh, and the, the town's also bigger and has
5266600	5275800	a shopping mall and you have a huge beach and you can swim in the ocean. Ooh. And uh,
5275800	5282880	you can actually exchange house designs with people, um, through street pass, like a model
5282880	5291400	home. Look, you know what this means? And draw Cox on him. Uh, Oh, uh, Oh. These street
5291400	5301720	paths has left his store. He has a new job. He's the town's real estate agent. Oh, great.
5301720	5309960	Tom Nook's a little asshole, but no wonder the housing market's screwed. I just want
5309960	5315240	to the KK to be awesome in it forever. Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over animal
5315240	5327560	crossing. Occupy Nooks. I'm just like, really? I'm switching to a really design your own
5327560	5333400	couch cushions. I don't fucking care. Well, I'm looking, Oh wow. You actually, your, your
5333400	5339160	little character looks a lot different. I thought those real people were like, Oh, that's
5339160	5346080	realistic. Some Japanese dude know what sad is they're trapped in your little town and
5346080	5350200	they have to sing and dance for you to get out. I'm looking at this little thing, which
5350200	5353600	I really shouldn't be, but I'm looking at it. Oh wait. Hey, I can look at it and then
5353600	5359560	the audio will play all over the feed for everybody to hear. That'll be fun. Let's see.
5359560	5366400	Pull up the link here. Oh, it's all in Japanese. That's okay. We had a Japanese trailer earlier.
5366400	5372000	Oh wow. The people actually do look quite a bit different. The little, the little characters.
5372000	5386880	I mean the animals. This is kind of boring. When do we see the people? It's like peppered
5386880	5397640	throughout the video. All right. That video is about as exciting as animal crossing is
5397640	5408200	on the second day. Hey. All right. I'm probably going to get it in a 3DS. Let's move on. Loki.
5408200	5416180	Um, well unfortunately it is the end of game pro. Um, they're going to cease publication
5416180	5421520	altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly. It will be their last issue
5421520	5429200	and uh, basically the website is shutting down tomorrow on the fifth and um, they're
5429200	5436000	done. So, uh, can I say something about that real quick? Yeah. Now I saw a lot of people
5436000	5440560	on Twitter kind of eulogizing this, which I completely understand you. I remember reading
5440560	5444380	game pro magazine when I was younger and it was, you know, one of the ways to get gaming
5444380	5448320	news and so forth. And I do kind of feel bad for the people that lost their jobs and so
5448320	5451860	forth through this because, you know, I bet a lot of these people probably read those
5451860	5456120	magazines growing up and really had a dream of working at game pro or working at a game
5456120	5461140	magazine and they got that and then, oh shit, it all changed. And now, you know, the job's
5461140	5465240	not there anymore that they wanted. I can see that's gotta be really depressing and
5465240	5469680	so forth. And there's a lot of people online kind of eulogizing game pro saying, can't
5469680	5473640	believe this happened. It's, it's sad that this happened. And I'm just thinking if everybody
5473640	5479120	that was eulogizing game pro actually bought the magazine or went to the website, it's
5479120	5483360	probably wouldn't have happened. You know, that make me a bitch for thinking that I was
5483360	5488240	in the store today. Oh, you're a bitch anyway. I was in the store today and I was walking
5488240	5492620	down the magazine aisle and I saw PC gamers sitting there. PC gamer. I used to buy it
5492620	5499000	all the time cause they'd have CDs full of demos and all this shit. PC gamer. I, as far
5499000	5506480	as I could tell, flipping through the magazine, no CD or DVD to be had whatsoever. $8.99 for
5506480	5511480	that fucking magazine. Fuck that. That's why I'm not buying magazines because they're too
5511480	5517320	goddamn expensive. And game pro, yeah, you know, um, it was great back in the day when
5517320	5521000	the internet wasn't around. Unfortunately now everything is digital and print magazines
5521000	5528800	unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store. Um, then you're not going to
5528800	5536080	do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives, you really have to buy them or somehow leverage
5536080	5540600	them out of these companies. And most of the stuff, you know, that may be in your magazines
5540600	5547120	already a month old by the time, you know, everything goes around. It's tough. You gotta
5547120	5554020	figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time sensitive material. And that's
5554020	5557480	tough because that's what people want. That's why retro gamers are great magazine cause
5557480	5564640	you're not expecting to see new stuff in there. So anyhow, um, interesting comment from Game
5564640	5567960	Guru in the chat room. I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no
5567960	5576680	gaming magazine besides PC gamer. See my favorite magazine right now is actually, um, retro
5576680	5585240	gamer. It's a British magazine. That's all old video games. The one I just mentioned.
5585240	5591000	Retro gamer is a very, okay. And keep in mind my, my career, what I'm going to make a career
5591000	5596200	of is print publication. And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort
5596200	5602640	into it printed on nice glossy stock. Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should
5602640	5609640	warn you it's going to be rough. I know. I got to tell you guys about this gaming magazine
5609640	5614600	that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games
5614600	5621960	in there. It's a magazine called retro gamer. I don't know if you've heard of it. Shut up.
5621960	5626760	All right. All right. Um, another thing that unfortunately went by the wayside as well.
5626760	5634240	Um, the website game set watch is ending its six year run. Um, basically what's going on
5634240	5640680	there is, um, they're basically stopping because they're having a lot of overlap with their
5640680	5646240	sister site, indie games.com. And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of
5646240	5650480	the best material out there is being indie related. Uh, they're just going to kind of
5650480	5657000	focus mainly on indie games.com. Also mainstream game blogs are doing much better job nowadays,
5657000	5662420	including the weirder and alt links and among the other gaming news. Yeah, I think a lot
5662420	5667000	of these gaming websites, to be honest nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.
5667000	5674760	Oh, hey, one game blog covered it. Let me cover it as well. And I mean, Kotaku, I read
5674760	5681760	you daily and joystick, you know, um, Kotaku. I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I
5681760	5686600	don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny. Uh, you know, how
5686600	5690160	many videos can I watch? Someone's spawning cheese and having to roll it down a Hill.
5690160	5694320	I mean, yeah, it's funny. The first time it's funny, but I don't, I don't need to see that
5694320	5700520	every single time. But, um, you know, I, I, I don't know. Yeah, there's a lot of, a lot
5700520	5706000	of sites out there for getting your news kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know,
5706000	5708920	why we don't really cover a lot of the news because I mean, really do you need another
5708920	5714960	source for, you know, website? No, we do talk about news, but just what we do is to have
5714960	5719540	some play. I have some walls. I mean, it once again, it's, it's all about, you know, hey,
5719540	5726320	we all have day jobs, um, it in our own lives and stuff. I mean, it's, once again, it's,
5726320	5730380	we're not going to be there, you know, right away unless we have some sort of scoop on
5730380	5736600	something, which is not very often cause we're not doing this professionally. Um, that it's
5736600	5741600	impossible for, you know, anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites
5741600	5745900	are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that. And we're
5745900	5756700	just a few people and we just can't do it. So we concede. All right. Uh, moving on. Since
5756700	5761700	Loki talked about, uh, how much he, uh, it gets sees a Skyrim information over saturating
5761700	5766580	the internet. Let's talk about Skyrim and a Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out
5766580	5772260	this week. A PlayStation three, X-Box three 60 and PC. And apparently, Oh, not doing too
5772260	5776800	good. It's, it's kind of buggy. A lot of users are reporting. Various issues are going on
5776800	5780680	with the game. Uh, apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance. That could
5780680	5785500	be an issue. Think about it. Yeah. The bug list is quite funny actually down the bottom
5785500	5790700	there. Uh, this, this here unofficial bug list. Oh, let me look at that. Just mentioning
5790700	5794800	some of the things. All right, let's look at this. Oh, is this like, Oh, something.
5794800	5797780	Somebody actually posted this on their own forums. Good Lord. Well, it's actually the
5797780	5802340	Bethesda forums. Yes. Yeah. But this isn't Bethesda that posted this. It's an unofficial
5802340	5808300	list. Yikes. Let's see. The dark brotherhood. Cal does not show a face mask. Only seems
5808300	5814460	to work for females, but doesn't show up for males. Hmm. Um, Oh, what, where's the funny
5814460	5821180	stuff? Well, character's getting stuck running. Um, you know, well obviously the, uh, resistance
5821180	5828440	is not being there. Uh, dragons flame backwards or erratic destruction. Trainers are not letting
5828440	5836140	me train. Markarth guards always try to arrest the player. Invisibility is being undone by
5836140	5842420	the shadow warrior perk for sworn conspiracy when going back to meet L tree players sometimes
5842420	5849980	finds him dead. Oh, uh, this is a funny one. Uh, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers was telling
5849980	5854980	me about, uh, he was playing and I guess one of his followers died. I think it might've
5854980	5860540	been Lydia. Um, cause she's the first, like, well, not really the first floor, but the,
5860540	5866900	the one you get appointed to by the URL. And, um, so apparently she got smashed by a troll
5866900	5872600	or a giant. She got smashed by a giant. Well, she didn't die. She kind of resurrected herself,
5872600	5876700	but she was still flat. And so she slipped around like a snake for about eight hours
5876700	5883680	in game. And then he was telling me also later on the game, like another person had died.
5883680	5888300	And so he's getting married or whatever. And like everybody keeps like walking in there.
5888300	5892460	This is just an outrage. This is disgusting. This bride keeps like storming off and stuff
5892460	5895620	like that. He's kept reloading and seems like, what the hell is going on? I can't fucking
5895620	5900220	understand what's going on. Looks down. There's the corpse of the person that died like days
5900220	5907860	ago and just like somehow teleported to your wedding. He wanted to come see it. But yeah,
5907860	5912100	I remember one of the patch bugs was like preventing people that have died from appearing
5912100	5919280	at your wedding dead. That's always a bummer. Um, I guess dragons are flying backwards.
5919280	5922720	That's another big thing that's going on right now. That's great. Well, Bethesda has come
5922720	5929560	out and said, you know, we, uh, promised to be more careful with patches in the future.
5929560	5935040	And my friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a monk, a dead monk in a jail cell,
5935040	5941900	except he looked like he was, uh, spasming all over the place. All right. LOL. Skyrim's
5941900	5946120	buggy. We get it. Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy. I mean, as great
5946120	5951980	as the game of Skyrim is, geez, it's kind of buggy. And, uh, you know, we didn't remember
5951980	5955900	when they couldn't patch games. Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?
5955900	5960060	Oh, you mean like on the Wii? And if you were gonna, if you were gonna patch him, you just
5960060	5966140	released a new game. We're going to take a step back to simpler times. Maybe it's a Wii
5966140	5970180	game this week, apparently, since now that's a classic gaming system. It's not a Wii game.
5970180	5979500	It's a classic game of the week. The classic game is a game that I've actually done the
5979500	5983500	full version of before, but I haven't done this specifically. So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas
5983500	5992980	Nights. It's my family tradition, dammit. So, um, basically, you, you know, fly around,
5992980	6001540	collect balls, put them in the idea cap, uh, machine, and go fight a boss. Yay. What? Nothing.
6001540	6005740	Just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees
6005740	6012140	that put the balls in for the, you know, the family guy jokes. I never saw it. Sorry. Anyway,
6012140	6017860	with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December, 1986
6017860	6023780	in Japan. It came with this Christmas Saturn bundle. And everywhere else, it was given
6023780	6028820	away with a purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and
6028820	6035580	was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Game Players, and Net Generation Magazine. Um,
6035580	6041340	it actually, though, um, if you got the magazine, the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't
6041340	6045780	have a slip cover. It just had a, a transparent one. Um, but it has its own, like, little
6045780	6049340	special cover. In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this. It got its
6049340	6055860	own jewel case and everything. Sucks. So with this one, um, it has the full version of,
6055860	6061420	um, one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley. Um, but both Claris and Elliot can play through
6061420	6066300	it. Um, Elliot couldn't in the full game. And he has a different layout than Claris'
6066300	6071420	one. This is actually a little harder. So basically, um, the way the story goes is that
6071420	6076220	they, uh, notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in
6076220	6082220	the center of town. So they go into Mytopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.
6082220	6092220	Um, at any rate, um, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it. Um, in November
6092220	6098380	and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition. Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition,
6098380	6105420	but it changed to Winter Nights. In December, it becomes Christmas Nights. Um, and then
6105420	6111580	the entire, uh, area that you go through instead of being all springtimey turns into wintry
6111580	6117900	places. And the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.
6117900	6124300	Um, you have, uh, presents everywhere. The music, as you can hear, is like a different
6124300	6127100	version of Jingle Bells. Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?
6137900	6144540	There's also, um, the other changes in the game. Um, well, you also do have to fight
6144540	6149900	the, um, the boss, which is Gilling from, of course, the last one, and save the star
6149900	6155260	from his lair, which is actually attached to his butt. And it's really fun and cool.
6155260	6160140	Now, the other neat stuff that happens is that, um, the weather in Spring Valley will
6160140	6165020	change depending on the hour. And then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's
6165020	6169740	Day, where instead of playing Nights, you play as Diala, which is pretty cool. It also
6169740	6174460	has a ton of hidden goodies in it. Like, one of the things that we unlocked last night was,
6174460	6181580	um, the trailer from Tokyo Game Show in 1996 when the game came out. Um, they call it Christmas
6181580	6186460	presents mode. You get, like, a time attack. You can get a special Link challenge. And
6186460	6192300	you also get a special level called Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams. So, Sonic goes
6192300	6200860	through Spring Valley on foot. And, um, you fight, uh, a bouncy ball version of Robotnik
6200860	6206460	slash Eggman. And the music is a remixed version of Final Fever, which was the final boss music
6206460	6210620	from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD. As I'm sure I've mentioned before,
6210620	6216300	they changed the US music. So, it's really neat. It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.
6216300	6221660	You know, there's even a karaoke mode, which you can sing the little theme song. And it's
6221660	6228620	really fun. So, it was a freebie, which was even better. So, this is back in the day when,
6228620	6235660	you know, they would do nice shit for us. Don't you remember? I do. So, that's your classic game,
6235660	6242300	Mr. Christmas Nights. Ho, ho, ho. There it is. Yeah, I love also children's books.
6242300	6251580	There you go. Yeah. Christmas Nights.
6251580	6256220	There it is, your classic game of the week. So, so time appropriate. I appreciate that.
6256220	6259340	We're going to take a quick break, guys. But when we come back, there's plenty more Orange
6259340	6263180	Laundry to come. We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced
6263180	6268540	this past week. That's going to be, uh, Lolsy. Uh, a special email bag. Somebody managed to get
6268540	6271820	an email in anyway, even though the email's down. We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.
6271820	6276300	And another game going free to play. We're going to talk about all that when we come back with
6276300	6287740	more of Orange Lounge Radio. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on
6287740	6295100	this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show. This show's been
6295100	6300700	going on a long time. I just want to point out. Every time you say the 37, I want to go in a row.
6300700	6305180	Right. Yeah. So during the break, uh, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about
6305180	6309180	Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays and some folks
6309180	6313420	were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas? And so we were sitting here thinking
6313420	6320300	like, well, Dark Sakura doesn't really do Christmas now. I mean, you do, but you don't. Well, it's kind
6320300	6326540	of like a non-issue thing, right? Dan and I do Christmas Eve. Okay. And, and then we'd go to
6326540	6332380	family stuff to eat free food. And we're doing stuff with, um, now Alan and I are doing stuff
6332380	6337660	with Alan's side of the family, but I don't know when that'll be done. We might be done by, I seem
6337660	6340700	to remember last year, we were kind of out of there about like four or five. So we'll see,
6340700	6344300	but I don't want to rush it. So I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not.
6344300	6350300	Probably not, but never say never. Right. So I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and
6350300	6354700	eat it live on air. It would be fun to do a Chinese food Christmas special, but you know,
6354700	6360620	we'll see. Um, anyhow, uh, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not you
6360620	6365500	guys. Um, the good news is the next week, uh, should be easy. So we'll have one week off for
6365500	6370300	the holidays and that should be it. Um, we'll let you know more about that in the next couple of
6370300	6374060	weeks. Cause believe it or not what Christmas is only about what three weeks away from today.
6374060	6380460	So yikes. All right. Jester Scott in our chat room says, take a day off peeps.
6380460	6384780	That's true. We deserve a day off. That's what we're getting for the holidays. A day off.
6384780	6391180	Let's go to Disneyland. Don't even tempt me. All right. We're going to get back into some more
6391180	6395340	gaming news. Uh, your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets. Make sure you
6395340	6398940	get your tweets in because especially since the email bag has been down this week, we're really
6398940	6403020	relying on your tweets. So get those into twitter.com slash O L R. We don't have quite as
6403020	6408220	much news this half of the show as we did in the first half of the show. So we definitely need your
6408220	6413820	calls and tweets tonight. So do we have a, do we have a work injury? What's going on? Dark Sockar
6413820	6418540	says she has a splinter. I have a splinter. All right, go do what you need to do. All right.
6418540	6422620	Loki will read some news. We'll take care of it. Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.
6422620	6426780	I'll do the news, I guess. Uh, so let's talk a little bit about
6428460	6435180	Zynga and apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of
6435180	6443260	a franchise with angry birds in it. Um, they were, apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for
6443260	6451500	2.25 billion dollar acquisition from Zynga. So that's, that's a lot of pride right there.
6452860	6459100	Good for them. That's what I have to say. Good, good for them that they rejected that offer from
6459100	6465260	Zynga because, you know, Zynga is kind of not the, um, I don't know, Zynga is kind of like,
6465260	6471260	you know how Google says do no evil? Well, Zynga does evil. That's kind of what they do. And that's
6471260	6479820	what they do best is evil stuff like Facebook and all that stuff. So, so Loki, why don't you do one
6479820	6486220	more story since Dark Sockar's out of the room. Why don't you, um, tell us about that role playing
6486220	6496060	game that's coming out very soon. If you can load up the story here if it, if it'll work.
6497260	6504540	All right. Sweet. Um, let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is great. South Park, you know,
6504540	6514060	they've had a lot of, eh, okay games and then of course they have to go and, and Dark Sockar is
6514060	6521340	bleeding apparently. No, um, and now it's come out to say something nasty, but I didn't. Thank God.
6521340	6526300	I, I appreciate that you did not say I was going to take it there. And then I said, you know what,
6526300	6530460	I'm not going to take it there. Um, you know, that would explain a lot about why she's so upset.
6531900	6536860	Uh, yeah. You know what? I know that Alan would really like for you to come home. Eventually
6536860	6541100	South Park. You were saying South Park. Uh, they have a, well, they have an Xbox live arcade game.
6541100	6546860	The, uh, the kind of side scroller co-op game, the South Park's Tenorman's Revenge, which is coming
6546860	6550060	out a little bit later on, but this isn't what we're talking about. We're talking about what was
6550060	6555340	revealed from the new cover of Game Informer. Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company
6555340	6562140	that can get exclusives when no one else can. Um, they have a new South Park game. Get the covers
6562140	6565820	already on the internet before it's in your mailbox. Well, they, they pimp that out usually
6565820	6573340	early on the Game Informer site. Um, they have a new RPG coming from Obsidian, the folks behind
6573340	6580140	the latest, uh, Fallout New Vegas. And, uh, it is going to be an RPG. And, uh, of course,
6580140	6586940	all 2D and everything. Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360,
6586940	6593260	PlayStation 3, and PC. And, uh, what's kind of cool about it though is they also have, uh,
6593260	6598620	some details out about it. Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about
6599740	6604300	you fitting in, I guess. And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be
6604300	6609580	completely customizable. Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff
6609580	6616860	like that. Um, and, uh, I think it's pretty awesome looking. They're saying it's gonna
6616860	6621180	combine, like, a bunch of different things. The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.
6621180	6627180	Uh, the weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from
6627740	6635340	7. Um, also they're saying that, of course, the entire game's gonna be 2D. Um, or at least look
6635340	6640060	hand drawn, I guess. I gotta say I'm a little worried though because the other South Park games
6640060	6644460	that have come out today have been kind of crappy. Granted, this is a new company doing this. Like,
6644460	6648380	who did the Nintendo 64 one? That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it? And that one,
6648380	6652380	that was that first person shooter. It really wasn't that good. So, I mean, you know, there's
6652380	6656940	been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live arcade games, like, you know, there was the Let's Play
6656940	6661020	Tower Defense and all this. But there haven't been a lot of, like, really good South Park games. But
6661020	6664940	I think a lot of that is because Matt and Trey haven't really been involved. But it sounds like
6664940	6667980	they're involving themselves in this. Like, you know, some of the stuff I was reading about,
6667980	6673100	like, how they actually designed what the town square would look like. They gave feedback to the
6673100	6678700	designers. Like, the designers wanted to do, like, Ike got kidnapped as a wolf as, like,
6678700	6685020	a story in the game or something. And the creators are like, no. So, it's good that it has their
6685020	6693020	input. Yes. I don't know. I'm excited. I'd buy it. Yeah. I'll definitely check that out. I mean,
6693020	6699500	you know, the demo and so forth is very important. But it's so funny that South Park is still going
6699500	6702780	after all these years. I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons too. God, The Simpsons has been on
6702780	6708380	forever. The Simpsons is still going. But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of
6708380	6715660	college. I was, what, 97 and it's still on the air. And people talk about, boy, South Park is so
6715660	6722540	old. Which means I'm so old. All right. Rob. What? I'm older than you. Oh, yeah, that's true.
6722540	6730940	All right. Moving on. There's always rumors about what is coming next on Microsoft's front. And this
6730940	6737500	isn't specifically about the Xbox loop. But this is about the Kinect 2. Which I could have sworn
6737500	6741420	we were talking about some of this last week. But for whatever reason... How are we talking about
6741420	6746860	Kinect for PC? I think so. But I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week.
6746860	6752540	So, here's the deal. Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect. And Kinect
6752540	6757180	2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected,
6757180	6761340	right? A more high def camera is all you really need. And maybe a better microphone in there. I
6761340	6765740	don't know. Or a higher sound sampling. But apparently, it's gonna have some other technical
6765740	6770860	stuff in it as well. It's going to be able to read lips. It will be able to detect the direction
6770860	6778060	that you're facing and recognize your emotional state. It's a little bit creepy. Why are you so
6778060	6783660	sad? I'm not sad. Why are you sad? Yeah, that's what I need. My Xbox. Because I don't hear it
6783660	6789740	enough on Xbox Live, I now need the Xbox device itself to sit there and go, you mad? You mad? And
6789740	6796140	start teabagging me. That's exactly what I want my Xbox to do, IRL. Well, look, a lot of this is just
6796140	6800540	what? A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device. The fact that it would
6800540	6804460	be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising. It was stuff
6804460	6807420	that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough
6807420	6811820	camera resolution. It didn't have the power! But now it will have the power, I'm assuming,
6811820	6816140	if there's going to be a Kinect 2 or whatever with the Xbox lube whenever it comes out.
6816700	6822700	So apparently one of the reasons why it's going to be more powerful, it will not utilize USB,
6822700	6826220	and therefore it's not going to be hampered by the USB speeds.
6826220	6831100	This is why the Kinect right now is somewhat limited. So there you go.
6835740	6839580	You know, the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing. I mean, especially for
6839580	6845500	what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth, or folks, you know. It's going to be
6845500	6850460	really neat, I think. It's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now, like when they showed
6850460	6854700	FaceTime for the first time and how deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of have phone calls.
6854700	6858300	So it's pretty awesome. So it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up
6859180	6860860	in that regard. That's cool.
6860860	6864620	Yeah, very cool. It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like,
6864620	6867500	the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.
6867500	6874060	So there you go. All right, we're going to go to our email bag. Now, here's the thing.
6874060	6879500	We don't really have like a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week. I would
6879500	6885500	say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6885500	6890060	However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in
6890060	6894620	Azeroth, hoardhouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning. And one of our special
6894620	6899420	guests all the way from the other side of the pond, Sill, beat me on Skype and said,
6899420	6903100	I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. And I said, well, we don't have an email right
6903100	6906860	now. She said, but I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. I said, okay, send it to me
6907660	6913100	and I'll have Jamie read it. And yeah, I know the topic she's talking about tonight is one that we
6913100	6917260	kind of tried to avoid, but that's all right. It's where every gamer has a voice. Let's,
6917260	6919580	let's talk about it. It's Dark Soccer. Would you read the email please?
6920700	6922700	Hello guys. Where's my music?
6922700	6927180	We also, oh shit. That's right. You need mailbag music. We also love Sill and we'll do whatever
6927180	6929340	she wants. I mean, really at the end of the day, right?
6929980	6931100	Sill is my hero.
6931100	6931580	That's right.
6937260	6937740	Email.
6938860	6943740	Hello guys. I'm so sorry for what happened to the website and I hope it will be,
6943740	6947740	I'll be resolved quickly. Now I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet,
6947740	6952380	but it seriously made me facepalm and I'm not even giving anybody the address because
6952380	6957180	it's retarded. It's called Mario Kills Tanuki. It's on the PETA website. If you really want to
6957180	6958540	find it, find it. But I don't care.
6958540	6962780	It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving. So
6963580	6965100	I think a lot of people heard of this.
6966380	6971660	I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end,
6971660	6976300	points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our
6976300	6980540	inner beings and morals. I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never
6980540	6985500	felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat. What is your feeling about what PETA did
6985500	6989980	here? I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing
6989980	6994380	up Shermie now and taking measurements. Then I haven't said anything. Love the show.
6994380	6997020	So first of all, Shermie.
6999340	7001260	Oh, the hell is that ringtone?
7002220	7006220	My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is bitches by mindless self-indulgence.
7006220	7011500	Okay. Um, apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now. So, um,
7013420	7019420	what I, what the fuck was I saying? Oh yeah. First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.
7019420	7023100	It's a bullshit organization. They put more animals to sleep,
7024060	7031180	or I should just say they murder more animals than they help. They're second in command.
7031180	7037180	Um, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, um,
7037900	7044300	they're, uh, second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal derived insulin.
7044940	7053660	Just saying. Their main leader is a sociopath who, um, basically has stated that she would rather
7053660	7061260	all humanity die than have and have the world ruled by animals. So just throw that out there.
7061260	7064540	She's crazy. Oh, but animals are so fuzzy wuzzy.
7065420	7069100	No, she says that she wants all humans to die. Okay.
7070060	7076700	So, um, Ingrid Newman, I think is her name. So anyway, we've got this organization
7076700	7084140	that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that are
7084140	7090140	we surprised at all that they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at,
7091020	7094300	you know, basically their target age group, which is gamer age. You know,
7094300	7098060	they're trying to get, get them young, get them in our, our little bracket.
7098060	7101420	Cause we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.
7101420	7107020	PETA makes so much money. PETA is smart. They are very smart
7107020	7112140	because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community. This isn't the first
7112140	7117340	time they've done something like this and they know that they will get completely free
7117340	7121820	advertising for a very long time from doing something like this. I like how they kind of
7121820	7126860	went back on it and said, Oh, it's just a joke, but whatever they're like weird ass reasoning
7126860	7132300	was or whatever, an audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought,
7132300	7134860	the majority of which probably this already wouldn't give him a second thought,
7135740	7139900	couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.
7139900	7143100	It was the week. We didn't, I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have
7143100	7148460	a show unexpectedly. Remember? So that's when this all kind of came up. So, you know,
7148460	7153580	PETA is very smart at what they're doing. And this is all part of a calculated plan to drive
7153580	7160220	more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer. It's like you sit there in your inbox
7160220	7165420	and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or the, you won the lottery
7165420	7169020	or congratulations, you're really the million- Make it Asian boobs! You're really the millionth
7169020	7174620	visitor to this website and you really did win this. But if one person falls for it, then-
7175980	7181020	I wish I had not clicked the link because I hate, I delete every PETA link that's in my
7181020	7187500	every PETA link that's in my viewing history. No, seriously. They don't get, I do not give them
7187500	7195100	attention. Let me, what I think is interesting about Sil's email is what she's really framing
7195100	7202140	it as in that paragraph there is she says, I really hate how an organization can tell us that
7202140	7209100	we are being influenced by games. Yeah. I thought that was really important because that is not
7209100	7214700	unique to PETA. That is absolutely not unique to this organization. This is just the most recent
7214700	7222460	example of this is that there's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for
7222460	7228140	political office, mind you. This is far and above any organization. People that actually wield
7228140	7236060	actual power that think gamers are stupid. Gamers are easily influenced. Gamers care nothing about
7236060	7241340	more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.
7241340	7247500	You know, like there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when
7247500	7252940	the reality is, especially now, thanks to Facebook, guess what? We're all gamers.
7254540	7259580	And I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing
7259580	7264380	as opposed to what they were doing before. When PETA made fun of what was it? Super Meat Boy was
7264380	7268380	one of the games they did before. They did a Cooking Mama one too. Most people don't know
7268380	7275340	Super Meat Boy. Most people don't know Cooking Mama. Everybody fucking knows Mario and especially
7275340	7281420	Mario 3. What person in their 20s or 30s or hell, even most teens that weren't born when this game
7281420	7289580	came out, what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3? Or older. I mean,
7289580	7294460	really. My mother played the game with me. Sure. Sure. You don't have to. But I'm just saying,
7294460	7298220	once you get above a certain age, you find more people that may truly not have known it because,
7298220	7302620	you know, video games, that's what the crazy kids are into. But if they're older and had kids,
7302620	7309020	they know it through their kids. You know? Because I knew plenty of my friends, their parents played
7309020	7316220	Mario with them. And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling
7316220	7321500	because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no. I know this Mario game and
7321500	7327340	you're being stupid. Yeah. People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like
7327340	7332780	that that they didn't know. But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki
7332780	7337900	suit, like, here's the thing. And it still goes on in the email to say something like,
7337900	7342700	I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat
7342700	7347180	and wear him like a hat. But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is,
7347180	7351580	I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch six and seven-year-olds when they
7351580	7355820	play. A lot of them are little freaks. And I mean that in a good way. But a lot of them will pretend
7355820	7361020	to be Tanooki Mario, like, oh, I'm flying or I'm a Tanooki statue. You know, they'll stay. I mean,
7361020	7364700	and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb. But guess what? When you were six or
7364700	7370540	seven, you were that dumb. Yeah. So you didn't want to skin your cat. You just wanted to be
7370540	7375420	Tanooki Mario. Mario was your freaking hero. Sure me, baby. I'm not going to skin you,
7375420	7380300	but I will use you as socks. All I have to do is have her sit on my feet. Anyway. But anyway,
7380300	7385580	my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that I didn't
7385580	7390620	want to skin the cat. I wanted to be, I wanted to be a statue. I wanted the freaking Hammer
7390620	7395100	Brothers suit. I wanted to save the princess. You know, that's because we were six, seven,
7395100	7399340	whatever age when this game came out. I wanted to throw hammers at people. PETA, you're being dumb.
7399340	7404540	I wanted to throw hammers at people. So yeah, no, seriously. That was my point. Yeah. Well,
7404540	7411100	I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once, but, but I mean, now this could still
7411100	7416380	happen. We could still make that dream come true. By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point
7416380	7421420	that I would like to, um, to bring up to our listeners of voting age. Sure. And then I want
7421420	7427900	to go to the chat room. Okay. Um, the people with power are trying to make these decisions for us
7427900	7436860	and your, basically every time that you say, fuck it. Every time you say, I don't, I can't make a
7436860	7448220	difference or I don't feel like it. Every time you display, um, apathy, you're basically saying,
7448220	7454380	do whatever you want to. I don't care. That means the shit that's going on in the world right now,
7454380	7460700	right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault because you didn't
7460700	7465580	vote for the people who need to make, who need to be the ones to make the change. You get enough
7465580	7470540	people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their
7470540	7475020	money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.
7477660	7482220	We'll see change then. Very serious point and very much needed. And I think everybody better
7482220	7486140	make sure they vote or you can't complain about these like things like SOPA and things like that
7486140	7489660	because you elected these people. My third catch phrase then, because you know, my first one is
7489660	7493500	welcome to the fantasy zone and get ready. The system is only as good as the games that are on
7493500	7497580	it. And number three change doesn't happen until you make it happen. Well, I thought it was going
7497580	7502300	to be reject false icons, but that works. I stole from gorillas. All right. Fair enough. Um, I want
7502300	7505980	to technically, I stole the first one from space Harrier. Let me go to some lols from our chat room
7505980	7509900	because the chat room is bringing the lols and it's talking about Tanuki Mario. Uh, Kaijuto in
7509900	7514700	chat says I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario. Uh, DDR dollar bill says the only
7514700	7520060	time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned. Um, let's see. Um, Tiger claw in our
7520060	7524540	chat says these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.
7525180	7531420	Um, and also says PETA never complained about angry birds, a game where you slingshot birds
7531420	7539820	into buildings. All I have to say, wait. Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote,
7541180	7546620	including my husband. Well, unless you're, you know, 17. Well, if you're a voting age,
7548380	7555180	and if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house and then you mail it back in.
7555180	7562540	You know what that requires? Walking to the mailbox. All right. Act F says, sadly,
7562540	7567980	I don't live in the US. Well, I meant for people who live here, people who can vote,
7567980	7571500	people who have the, in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote,
7572940	7577420	your votes matter in your country, in your community, you make the difference in your own
7577420	7582860	damn community. Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life. The end. All right.
7582860	7588780	I think Dark Sakura is ready for the FUs of the week, or maybe she already did it. Let's use it
7588780	7614460	anyway. My FU goes to bones006 today. Um, who, uh, can't spell. What has an H in it. The word is
7614460	7621900	about, about, B-O-U-T is like a battle or a match. People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E,
7621900	7625500	can't has an apostrophe in it and appeared. You are part of what is wrong with the country
7626140	7633500	and everybody else fucking vote. All right. Okay. Um, oh boy.
7635260	7639340	I guess I'd just say, uh, F-U-2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.
7639340	7648060	There's only so much time in the day. Uh, my FU of the week just goes to like being like
7648780	7653740	really, really busy and just, there is so much going on right now. And like, you know,
7653740	7657340	like somebody said to me last night, like, oh, boo, boo, you have the biggest problem that you
7657340	7663020	have too much on your social calendar to do, but I just, it can be exhausting and just, you know,
7663660	7666780	sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't
7666780	7672860	want to piss people off. It's just, uh, it's just rough. So F-U all that.
7674460	7681020	The holidays are about loving, damn it. I actually do have a little tiny one.
7681020	7688540	All right. People, um, F-U to everybody who says that Christmas isn't, is becoming less Christian
7689340	7696220	because it wasn't Christian to begin with. It was very, very, very, very pagan. The end.
7696220	7700220	Can't we all just get along? Oh, come on. It was about burning trees.
7701500	7705340	How is that not pagan? Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?
7706140	7709260	No, cause fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth. No, but he could make water into wine.
7710060	7716940	He also wasn't, nevermind. Oh, so I have to, I have to say this. My mom, my mom tried to have
7716940	7720060	this argument with me and you were there for that. That's where the gay pie party came from.
7720940	7724860	She says, well, what would, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?
7724860	7733580	Um, Hanukkah was always Jewish. Um, yeah, that made no sense, mom.
7734140	7740380	Well, also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah. No, it's actually a menorah is a Hebrew word for
7740380	7747500	a candelabra. The technical term is a Hanukiah. So it is. How about some rapid fire gaming news?
7747500	7752780	Loki, you have a lot of news to talk to us about. We're going to quickly go through some stories.
7752780	7759180	Let's talk about Rhythm Heaven. It's coming to, uh, the Wii in the North America in February,
7759180	7765660	uh, Rhythm Heaven Fever. And, um, this was announced via Nintendo Power. So I would say
7765660	7773820	that's pretty legitimate. And, um, I hate the game to be honest. I played it on the DS, did not care
7773820	7778140	for Rhythm Heaven. Just not my thing. Some people are really into it though. Yeah. If you like
7778140	7783340	rhythm, I haven't played it enough. You like rhythm games and, um, by all means, uh, go ahead and check
7783340	7789420	it out. Of course, there was supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow
7789420	7796620	you to shoot some 3D video. Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time. It is scheduled though for
7796620	7802940	this week on December 8th. So you can look forward to that. And of course that will give you, uh, the
7802940	7809980	3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service
7809980	7817980	and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on. So more Mario
7817980	7825580	Kart tracks we can only hope. Um, Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight. It is going
7825580	7833500	to be a brand new, um, Microsoft Flight sim. And, uh, of course, they haven't really unveiled too
7833500	7838700	many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that
7838700	7846780	series. It's definitely popular. So, yeah, it'd be cool. And then of course, um, last but not least,
7846780	7852060	um, or actually this isn't even close to last year. I kind of thought that they already had something
7852060	7858780	like this, but it's still neat to see anyways. There's a new device out called the Supaboy. And
7858780	7864780	what the Supaboy does is allows you to play, uh, Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo
7864780	7871020	cartridges, on the go. It's one of those devices that you can play, um, it's like a handheld system
7871020	7875820	and also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make
7875820	7883580	like a mini console of sorts. And so that's available for purchase as well. And, uh, actually,
7883580	7889340	I believe it's on Amazon. Let's see what this thing goes for here. Uh, 80 bucks. That's almost
7889340	7894300	cheaper. I think the buying Super Nintendo, but if you want to play, you know, something portable
7895340	7901740	without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go. That's the way to go about
7901740	7910140	it. Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched
7910140	7918380	Tetris on the iOS, uh, system or platform if you will, but there is a little issue with it. Um,
7919020	7927100	it's $30 a year and, um, you can basically, uh, thanks Apple for opening up the subscription
7927100	7931660	thing to everybody. Really appreciate that. Cause EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?
7931660	7937020	Um, it does have some new features including, uh, galaxy mode and marathon one touch mode,
7937660	7943820	whatever that means. And also, um, it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay.
7944460	7950540	And of course, um, you can subscribe to the Teak Club, which offers exclusive access to new mobile
7950540	7960540	challenges. Um, you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you could drop $30 for a full year.
7960540	7968780	And of course the game costs you money anyways. It's 99 cents. I'll pass. Thank you very much.
7969340	7976060	Ditto. And then of course, uh, last but not least Lego Batman 2, um, it's going to be coming out
7976060	7981020	at some point. And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other
7981020	7986300	superheroes involved with it as well. Not just Batman. In fact, there's a little teaser showing,
7986300	7992460	um, Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as, um, you know,
7992460	7998620	some other characters. So, uh, Batman, Lego Batman 2 super DC superheroes will be the new title,
7998620	8004780	I believe. And, uh, that'd be kind of neat. And also they're saying that they're expecting
8004780	8012620	that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well. Looks cool. It's going to be hard
8012620	8016300	to compete with Arkham City though, even when you're Legos. Well, I understand that. And the Lego
8016300	8024060	games are pretty fun. Lego Batman wasn't bad. So, um, it'll be cool. All right. Um, another game is
8024060	8028780	going free to play. Another MMO has announced that they're going free to play, which usually means
8028780	8035020	it just didn't work with the subscription model. Um, EverQuest 2 is now gone for going free to
8035020	8040380	play, but here's the weird thing. Okay. EverQuest 2 kind of did a free to play thing already last
8040380	8046620	year. It was a browser based game called EverQuest 2 extended, but the rest of the game is now going
8046620	8052140	free to play on December 6th. Um, the offerings of, um, ever, excuse me, I'm going to sneeze in
8052140	8057740	a minute. Bless you. Oh, rude. My body faked me out. Have you ever had that happen? It's like,
8057740	8063740	I'm going to sneeze. I'm going to sneeze psych. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Great radio. Uh,
8063740	8069420	EverQuest 2 extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2 and there will be
8069420	8075980	free. There will be silver and there will be gold free members get just a little bit silver members,
8075980	8081820	which paid $5 or 500, uh, space bucks station point things per month. They get a little more.
8081820	8086060	And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole 15 a month. Well, you get everything.
8086700	8091260	So there you go. EverQuest 2, you can now check out. I wonder if it'll get the same reception that,
8091260	8097420	um, uh, DC universe did. I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff
8097420	8102140	in it. You know, EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed
8102140	8105260	that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1. So people didn't want to leave
8105260	8112060	EverQuest 1, which is still going, still going dark soccer. What do you got for us?
8113340	8118860	Well, I have a little something for us, and that is something about a game that people have been
8118860	8122620	waiting for, except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting
8122620	8130460	for. It's, um, Kid Icarus, but it's the 3D classics. Kid Icarus is going to be given away for
8131020	8141340	free when, um, it launches on January 5th. And that's, um, you have to register two eligible
8141340	8149500	3DS titles online this Christmas. So that's kind of janky, but all right, whatever. It's a club
8149500	8154860	Nintendo thing. So you'd get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes
8154860	8163180	out next year. But where's the fun? Ugh. People. All right. But I mean, for the people that are
8163180	8167580	getting Mario Land 3D or whatever, and I guess I shouldn't say jank because, you know, free,
8167580	8173420	free is free. So, uh, and a lot of people are getting the Mario 3D Land and the Mario Kart 7,
8173420	8176780	so it's going to make sense that there'll be a lot of people that are getting this. I totally
8176780	8183020	won a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama. There you go. All right. Well,
8183020	8186380	believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight. So we're going
8186380	8192140	to actually open up the Skype line. It is open now 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is
8192140	8195980	OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call. There's a little bit of a delay tonight. So before
8195980	8200380	I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be
8200380	8203820	a few more in a minute here. We'll see. Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you
8203820	8207260	want to talk about, Loki, with, um, last minute stories before we get to the Twitters? Yeah,
8207260	8212940	let's talk about, uh, how the Vita will not support simultaneous, uh, web browsing and game
8212940	8218300	play. Can only do one or the other at the time. And, uh... Is that really that big of a deal,
8218300	8221340	though? Nah, I don't think so. I don't think so either. I mean, I know a lot of people are making
8221340	8223980	a big deal out of it, but I don't, I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like,
8223980	8230780	what system now lets you do that? Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that. Hello. But, you know,
8230780	8237820	I, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so. Yeah, um, also, of course,
8237820	8243580	there's, uh, that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be
8243580	8249420	discounted 40%. I don't know where that's, it's, apparently you said that a recent Vita event
8249420	8257900	is where they announced that. In my pants. I, I don't think so. I don't know. Even if they are,
8257900	8262940	that's still too damn much for those random cards. Yeah, and that's great. That, that's promoting
8262940	8266780	that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what? I wouldn't do that anyways,
8266780	8271180	because, guess what? I get tired of my games after a while, and I wanna sell them used.
8272700	8278300	So, meh. What's gonna be awesome is if they figure out a way to erase the game cards and
8278300	8284620	use them as memory cards. You buy, like, a cheap ass $10 game and it's like, hey,
8284620	8287980	I'm gonna erase this shit. That's what I think's gonna ultimately happen. I think the hackers are
8287980	8293020	gonna find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards. I, I could see that happening,
8293020	8299740	absolutely. Again, our Skype line 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8300300	8307900	Anything else? Um. I like fire. There was another, another, uh, story commenting on the whole FIFA
8307900	8313420	fishing thing. Apparently EA has put up some stuff on their website about how to spot fishing sites.
8313420	8317020	And they're still insisting that it's not a security breach, but yeah.
8317020	8322220	Yeah, there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name. I'm so sorry,
8322220	8326620	but the guy was writing about how he got hacked. And it's like kind of one of those things was
8326620	8331580	like, I just, I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked, to finally kind
8331580	8335020	of put it out there where it's like, well, wait a minute. I didn't get fished. And he even says
8335020	8340940	this in the story. Like, I don't think I got fished. You know, I'm, I'm not happy this is
8340940	8346140	happening to people, but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites. So let me
8346140	8348860	go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic. Remind me to come back to this.
8348860	8352940	Okay. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma
8352940	8358300	Sautome. Hey. Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy? Not much. A couple of things. I just got home,
8358300	8364780	so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds Cookbook. No, I didn't. The Angry Birds Cookbook.
8364780	8372380	Good God. Can this game get any more saturated? It's a cash cow. What can I tell you? Yeah, right.
8373660	8378860	So what is in the Angry Birds Cookbook? What will I learn how to cook? Birds? Actually, I don't know.
8378860	8382540	I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to
8382540	8391020	read into it. What's that? I'm sorry. Dark Cyrus phone went off. I said I just saw it online on
8391020	8396300	our friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered. Maybe it talks
8396300	8400860	about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.
8402540	8409020	Or pig-themed recipes. Seriously, an Angry Birds Cookbook? Like, how? I don't know. Forget it.
8410620	8415180	I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade. I think that's Loki's department.
8415180	8417980	Ah, Loki's all tiraded out tonight. I don't know if you heard Part A.
8417980	8425660	No, I was at a premiere tonight, so. That's alright. Let's just say that Xenoblade news
8425660	8433580	just kind of one thing led to another on that department. Oh god. I can't wait to listen to
8433580	8438140	tonight's episode. Oh, and our website's coming back. That's the big news you missed too. We'll
8438140	8442540	be back just depending on when DNS updates for people, so hopefully within 24 hours.
8442540	8448300	Wonderful. Yep. But, um, the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.
8448860	8454620	A game review? Alright. What do you want to review? Voltron, Defender of the Universe
8454620	8459340	for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Wha-wha-wha? Oh, you didn't-
8459980	8464940	No. You didn't know? No. Yes, it came out Wednesday. I'm in school. I have no life.
8466540	8469180	She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft. But anyway,
8469180	8472940	uh, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.
8474380	8478860	Long and short of it, you are control of any of the five lions and is up to you to protect
8478860	8485500	the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat on Lotor. Is it like a tower defense game?
8485500	8492060	Actually, no. The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars. Oh, that's kind of cool. I like
8492060	8499900	Geometry Wars. Now, take your typical treasure shooter. It's like that. You're pretty much
8500460	8506700	running around the plains just blasting everything with the- that you can- that the lasers can see.
8507820	8510540	Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up Dark Sakura's alley.
8511980	8517340	It's a cave shooter or treasure shooter mixed with- Want. Want. You should go download the demo
8517340	8523420	on Xbox. I think I will. Uh, Uchon, one more thing. Yes. If you like- if you like it,
8523420	8527900	depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.
8528700	8534540	Aww, what a nice boy. Aww, okay. That's the best part about doing this show. Once in a while,
8534540	8542380	free shit. Heck yeah. Thank you. Love you, Rama. Love you, Mina. So on a scale of, um,
8542380	8548140	one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?
8548140	8553820	Seven. That's a pretty good review. So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger? Hell yeah.
8553820	8557500	Now, what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?
8558060	8565820	Your butt's for babies. As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate. Hey, Rama, do you know what I
8565820	8573500	actually just watched all of last week? What? Go Lion. I have all of it and I watched all of it.
8574140	8578220	By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Bro is called Hate is Gonna Hate.
8578220	8581580	I heard about that. I saw somebody get that on Twitter. And, and Rama,
8584620	8588140	this is such a great story. You're going to hate it, but I don't care. Okay. So I thought
8588140	8594620	of you this week. Yeah. Okay. I was watching Wendy Williams. That's a man. I just want you to know
8594620	8602380	that's a man. Okay. But you know, I love Wendy Williams. Okay. How you doing? And she was talking
8602380	8606860	about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something. And at the end of it, she said,
8606860	8613260	and I kid you not, she said, stay black. And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?
8613260	8619580	Cause I thought that joke started here. Uh, wait, wait, wait, Rob, stop. You said you like
8619580	8624940	Wendy Williams? Haters gonna hate. 50 points from Gryffindor.
8627500	8631580	All right. Look, I'm trying, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of
8631580	8635980	listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them. In this case,
8635980	8640620	somebody say stay black. Cause that all started with you here on the show, you know.
8640620	8647740	It didn't actually, it's not just, uh, related to, it's, it's a phrase that's been out for a
8647740	8652860	long time. I know that, but I'm just saying, I heard it in mainstream press this week and it
8652860	8659020	made me think of our Rama. Stay black. Dan didn't bring me any high, I'm mad at him.
8660300	8663260	All right, Rama, we're gonna let you go to get more calls, but, um, go back to Voltron,
8663260	8668620	have fun. Will do. And of course, stay black. And you stay fabulous. I will. Oh, I will girl.
8668620	8675740	All right. Bye. One eight seven seven game O L R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
8675740	8680700	Cause you don't chat. So stay black is an old saying. I know that. Gosh, I'm just being silly.
8681900	8688140	All right. Orange lounge radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. O L R.
8689500	8690940	How about some tweets in the meantime?
8694460	8700540	O L R fan forever. Hey, I like that name. That's a great Twitter name. O L R fan forever. And it's,
8700540	8705740	it's, it's like, it's not my mom or something. Like it's an actual person. O L R fan forever
8705740	8711660	asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester? Was dark Sakura eliminated?
8712620	8717660	Actually, I believe dark Sakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention.
8717660	8724140	Correct? I just didn't bother promoting it. You just kind of after, I mean, that night it was
8724140	8728940	funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that? And
8728940	8735660	it was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland on the negative side. I would be
8735660	8743820	whoring myself out to Sony. I am no one's whore. Let's go to the phones higher on orange launch
8743820	8755500	radio. Who's this solid train pulling up to the station. By the way, can I just say though the,
8755500	8761420	I'm assuming this is your kid on the user pic. Adorable. Isn't she fresh and clean.
8761420	8767900	Absolutely adorable. Look at her little hoodie on it. I know it's precious. I love it. All right.
8767900	8771660	Sorry to derail. Try sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said,
8771660	8776620	what's on your mind, buddy? Jim Sally train's coming in today. We got to have some discussions
8776620	8783340	people. Okay. First off, we need to talk about evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers
8783340	8790540	issues with these game cards expiring. It's not, we really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their
8790540	8795980	game cards expire. It's evil G's fault. You know, if I went to the grocery store to buy some milk
8795980	8800140	and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer. I'd yell at the store that sold me
8800140	8804780	the expired milk. I think EB games should be taking these games off their shelves. Shouldn't
8804780	8810220	be EA's fault. You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it. I have to admit,
8810220	8815420	I didn't really think about it like that. I mean, I don't know. I kind of, I get what you're saying.
8815420	8819020	I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I'm kind of like, I feel like they
8819020	8822620	didn't really think about this. I don't think they informed the stores either. They have this problem.
8822620	8826380	And I kind of think the stores don't know either. I think people just told evil G,
8826380	8830860	the evil, you know, evil G is they would just pretend like they didn't know sell it to you
8830860	8835740	anyway. I don't care, but they're so they're all in cahoots. I don't think they're in cahoots. I
8835740	8841420	think evil G is just doing it anyway. Like EA probably told evil G, yo, give us those games
8841420	8845900	back if you don't sell them. Evil G is like, whatever, we can sell anything. I would honestly
8845900	8850300	think though that evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe
8850300	8856060	like an independent Ma and Pa shop who, you know, only rarely gets a lot of people to come through
8856060	8860620	there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time.
8860620	8864460	Because the Ma and Pa retailer is losing out to places like evil G. They're getting these
8864460	8869020	exclusives and so forth. I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their
8869020	8874140	shelf. And I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't
8874140	8881180	control that no one wants the goddamn game. I don't know. Well, either way, in EA's fault,
8881180	8884540	how long are you supposed to keep these codes active for? And it's a service. There's no
8884540	8889740	monetary value to it. Right? It's a service. It's not like a gift card. A gift card is an
8889740	8895580	account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency. I realize the gift
8895580	8901980	card thing is a stretch. It is a service being provided later. It is a little bit like you can't,
8901980	8905660	it's not apples to apples comparison. But my point with that was that it's still,
8906460	8914300	it would be $10 to replace that pass. So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly
8914300	8924860	you're losing. Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have
8924860	8930700	dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year. And
8930700	8934380	here's the other thing too. Look at Blizzard games. If they're saying that, oh, by the way,
8934380	8939340	you know, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st. Okay,
8939340	8944220	well then I'm gonna buy used. Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive
8944220	8948700	to do so? That's not the way to do it. Really? It's not the way to do it? We shouldn't punish
8948700	8954860	the publishers for doing this type of bullshit? Yeah. How are we supposed to keep the stuff open
8954860	8959980	for it? I don't even think it's a punishment thing. It's just a, any shoppers gonna find the
8959980	8967980	best value they can. Yeah, man. It's up to you. When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up to the
8967980	8973100	dealership down the street, you shop around a little bit before you buy it. You have to
8973100	8976780	educate yourself a little bit before you buy it. Yeah, and play the game with people. Everyone's
8976780	8982460	got a different deal. But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because
8982460	8988380	they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that. If there's nothing there that, you
8988380	8992620	know, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game, you know, and someone
8992620	8999260	hasn't played this copy of the game, then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new,
8999260	9003420	I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap. Now going back to
9003420	9009260	the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore because they
9009260	9013420	know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day? EA has already made their
9013420	9016860	money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf. They don't care at this point if the game is sold
9016860	9020140	new or used because they already sold the game. They're probably not buying new copies of that
9020140	9023820	game anyways because they probably have like a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyways.
9024380	9029340	And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, you know, say I want to buy
9029340	9032460	a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that. Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies
9032460	9037420	that are used, you know, that are in good, you know, good quality that you can get for, you know,
9037420	9041980	five, ten dollars cheaper or whatever. And most people will be like, okay, sure, I'll do that.
9042700	9046460	Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that. But, you know, you can probably guess
9046460	9054780	that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run
9054780	9058620	of Mass Effect 2. Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, or, well, not Game of
9058620	9061980	the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.
9062620	9065740	That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.
9067180	9072780	I mean, I don't know. I haven't really looked at it, but they may have. All right. Well, Jim Sally,
9072780	9076060	I gotta wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets. Do you have any
9076060	9080140	any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter? South Park Game is
9080140	9083340	going to be a great game of Obsidian. They're the best developers ever in the world of Obsidian.
9083340	9088380	Thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 and Vegas and Knights of the
9088380	9094860	Republic 2. I love you everybody, and don't forget, if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed,
9094860	9102540	you're picking it too much or not enough. Thank you for that sage advice, Jim Sally.
9102540	9107580	Appreciate it. I have high hopes for the South Park Game too, I will say, so I hope they don't
9107580	9112540	let me down. Back to the Twitters. 1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio. We can
9112540	9116540	probably squeeze in like one more call. Dark Tetsuya tweeted us and said, hey,
9116540	9121740	OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One. I don't think I've ever loved
9121740	9125180	a book this much. P.S. Fuck the Sixers. I'm assuming that's something from the book.
9127180	9130860	Tigerclaw sends us a few stories that slip through the cracks otherwise.
9130860	9136220	Some layoffs at Day One Studios because they lost a Konami publishing deal.
9137020	9142300	Tigerclaw links us to an article on Gamasutra via the Twitter saying that Day One Studios,
9142300	9149660	who developed F.E.A.R. 3 and Mech Assault, they laid off 95%. That's an entire development team
9149660	9155660	because they lost a publishing deal with Konami. Apparently, they were working on a reboot of
9155660	9163660	Silent Scope. Interesting, but I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they
9163660	9171260	pulled it. Yeah, Silent Scope is kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go, maybe with all
9171260	9175820	the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off. Maybe. Well, they didn't have
9175820	9179980	to do it that way. I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now. They have Sniper
9179980	9188220	Elite and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior, something like that, that was actually pretty well
9188220	9193740	liked and they have sequels coming out. I mean, there's not a lot of sniper games, but I think
9193740	9198780	something like Silent Scope would have stood out. I would have guessed that they were working on,
9198780	9202940	was it that, I don't remember the fuck the series is called now, the one that was on the PSP and
9202940	9206860	then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3. It was like a sci-fi shooter or something
9206860	9212860	like that. I don't remember. That's how wonderful that game was. But there was, it was supposed to
9212860	9217340	be like a launch title for the PS3, but I guess I would have been a little late. All right, let me
9217340	9221900	go to the phones. We got one more call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is
9221900	9228300	Kokomo. I just have a question. When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1,
9228300	9235020	2, and 3? That's a lot of Mass Effect. I got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I
9235020	9240780	really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me. But here's the
9240780	9245020	thing. What I really like about what they're doing in Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea. I mean,
9245020	9248700	I guess this is from that demo that leaked out before and all that. Remember how they had the
9248700	9254620	demo up early? Is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode
9254620	9259180	that focuses more on the battle. It's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end
9259180	9263980	of the game you like more. And the RPG mode to me sounds really, really interesting because I do
9263980	9268540	think BioWare can tell some good stories. But as far as like, do I have enough time to freaking
9268540	9275740	play Mass Effect 1 and 2? Probably not. But if Mass Effect 2, or if they do with 3, what they
9275740	9280700	do with 2, didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect
9280700	9287580	1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game? Sort of, yeah. On the PS3, they did.
9288620	9291980	So maybe there'll be something like that. So at least the rest of us can get caught up.
9291980	9294860	What's your opinion on it? Are you a Mass Effect fan?
9296140	9300300	I really do enjoy Mass Effect. I mean, I'm probably going to have to take like a whole
9300300	9307900	like week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3. I mean, then you have like all the different
9307900	9313500	things like you can be evil. And then that's another play around. It's just so much time.
9314380	9319660	This is the way of BioWare though. Like right now, Alan has been playing a lot of Dragon Age.
9319660	9324220	Like he just randomly like this month decided to start playing this game from 2009, but I've
9324220	9328780	watched him play through it once. It's kind of like a goody two shoes. Once it's a villain,
9328780	9332540	now he's working on the expansion. It's kind of like he got two completely different types of
9332540	9336780	games based on how he was playing the story. And this is one thing that BioWare is like really
9336780	9341740	good at. And it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about The Old Republic because
9341740	9347740	Lover hates Star Wars. They're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect style storytelling in Dragon Age
9347740	9354220	into an MMO. And for some people, that's very, very exciting. Absolutely. All right. That's all
9354220	9358620	my questions. You guys have a great night. That's all right. Thank you for your station. All right.
9358620	9362780	Well, thank you so much. Have a great night and try not to lose too much sleep when the game
9362780	9368140	comes out. Okay. I won't. All right. Later. I know a lot of people are very excited about
9369340	9372540	Mass Effect 3. You know, it's just one of those series where it's like, if there were more hours
9372540	9377900	in the day, I probably would have gotten into Mass Effect, but I just, you can't play everything,
9377900	9385340	especially when you have a day job. All right. TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here.
9385340	9390940	And that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking
9390940	9399820	deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to a story at 1UP.com, where apparently the Digital Millennium
9399820	9406860	Copyright Act, the DMCA, a few exemptions were granted about a year ago, which had to do with
9406860	9412620	the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use. Now the EFF is saying,
9412620	9416620	shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well? If you want to mod your video
9416620	9421660	game consoles, what do you think? I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if
9421660	9425740	you can jailbreak your phone, why can't you jailbreak your video game console? Loki, I'm
9425740	9430940	sure you're all for this. Well, just because it's legal to do that doesn't mean that it's
9430940	9435500	necessarily going to be any different than it is now, because basically they'll still ban your
9435500	9441340	console or whatever if you try to go online. All it means is that you can't have anything like,
9441340	9446300	you know, Sony coming after Geohot or something like that. They won't have that. And I was going
9446300	9454220	to say, is it really illegal to do that right now? Technically, I mean, sort of it is. I mean,
9454220	9458540	but they're just not going to come after the user, especially now that they have, in fact,
9458540	9465260	ironically enough, I'm looking at some right now about reset glitch hacking on. Well, you can do
9465260	9471900	it on any Xbox 360, regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now. And looking at slim
9471900	9477980	body and stuff like that. Just curious to see what's required for that stuff. Interesting.
9477980	9483500	You know, I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem. It's that they don't
9483500	9490460	want you playing pirated games on it for one and, you know, using exploits and all that stuff as
9490460	9494140	well. So that's why, you know, usually these companies will kick you off the network if they,
9494140	9497900	which they can do because it's their network. Exactly. But, you know, like for instance,
9497900	9501100	didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation threes because they were super computers?
9501740	9506700	They probably never upgraded them or, you know, who knows, maybe they even found a work around
9506700	9509740	so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.
9509740	9513500	I don't think those things even, I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation network. They're
9513500	9521340	just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter. All right. Well, that's going to do it for the
9521340	9525100	Twitter topics tonight. And that's also going to do it for the Skype line. Big apologies to those
9525100	9528940	didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us
9528940	9534060	tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+. We'll take your comments there too.
9534060	9538780	We can read some of those on the show, but for now, that's it. We're wrapping up. We're getting
9538780	9541740	out of here. You were done with last minute stories, right? Loki, do we finish everything?
9541740	9547020	Okay. Um, I didn't have anything. I figured because you would have spoke up if you did.
9547900	9552700	Hey. Hey. So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio. Um,
9552700	9557340	it's almost nine o'clock or midnight on the East coast. So I think it's about time to wrap up.
9557340	9561100	Um, first off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show. Thank you for downloading
9561100	9565260	and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. You know, it's been kind of a poopy past couple of weeks
9565260	9569740	with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us. Those of you that
9569740	9572300	are listening live are still showing up and listening live. We have a lot of people in
9572300	9576140	chat tonight. So thank you guys so much. And podcast ease, you've stuck by us and here you
9576140	9580140	are downloading another show. So I just, I really appreciate it. Thanks for the support. Um,
9580140	9583740	remember if you like Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money,
9583740	9586380	although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.
9587660	9591900	That will be an exception. Uh, but you know, here on this program, we don't ask for your money. All
9591900	9598540	we ask help spread the word, tell somebody about the program and, uh, you know, help the OL army
9598540	9603180	grow. So on that note, let's go around and get her base final thoughts so we can get out of here
9603180	9607180	tonight. Loki, I'll start with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I'm
9607180	9613980	picking a really weird song for cage match. Awesome. Um, my final thought is now, now that
9613980	9618700	Loki's lamey borrow saints road, the third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the
9618700	9625180	character that, um, uh, Travis Donovan pass is only for playing co-op or co-op or system link.
9625180	9629820	Um, all right. I'm going to have to figure out how to do that. I want Travis Donovan's little, um,
9629820	9635340	you need it. Okay. Well you need to create a profile on the saints row website. Once you do
9635340	9641500	that, you go browse to his character and you click it to you add it to as like a book market
9641500	9645500	or something like that. And you go into your game and you log in with your account from the saints
9645500	9651740	row website and then you can download it. I can do that. Yes. Awesome. All right. And a dark soccer,
9651740	9656380	your final thought. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the difference of one day
9656380	9662540	makes a hundred dollar price difference in plane to plane fare. Yes. And that was from a Tuesday
9662540	9666940	to a Wednesday. Oh, I was going to say Thursday to Friday or something on the weekend I get,
9666940	9673420	but that's boy, airline fees are interesting. That's uh, yeah, exactly a hundred dollars.
9673420	9678380	Wow. All right. Well thank you guys, uh, again for tuning in and downloading the show and one
9678380	9684380	more time. Awesome event happening this Thursday, December 8th, six 30 Pacific nine 30 Eastern
9684380	9689020	um, loud.org. I'll be there live. Dark soccer will be there in house. If you're in the San
9689020	9693580	Francisco Bay area, you better be at the DNA lounge. Bring 10 bucks, bring a little more
9693580	9698300	to donate for some raffle tickets and stuff to a great cause. Um, loud. We're going to rock out.
9698300	9702380	So I'll see you on Thursday and then we'll see you again back here Sunday night for another
