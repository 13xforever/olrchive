14093	24908	Tonight, December 18, 2011, Square Enix experiences a hack, Nintendo offers free games for loyalty points, and the PlayStation Vita appears to abandon the instruction manual.
31567	38389	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38469	44911	We are live with the 439th episode of our show on this December the 18th of 2011.
45071	55874	We're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
56474	57494	My name is Rob Roberts.
57534	66138	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gamer culture, gamer lifestyle, and so forth with my co-host, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
68679	71820	You're like that video of Rick Perry where they replaced him with a butt.
72320	73140	That one was great.
73841	74301	How are you?
75221	76222	I'm okay.
76922	77782	It's been a long day.
78202	79263	It's been a long day.
79723	80743	Been packing up stuff.
81844	82044	Been...
84265	87288	Prepare to abandon ship
102836	103937	Mario Kart Break Time!
127518	129159	and talk with us there.
129699	130039	All right.
131339	138421	In fact, Jim Sally is in our chat room tonight starting us off talking about the intro to the show saying, Jim Sally, OLR's intro is great.
138461	139442	It always pumps me up.
140442	141582	It is a great little song.
141602	142523	That was by MidiHead.
142823	144743	If you don't know who did our intro, his name is MidiHead.
144763	150845	He did some of the songs in DDR Beatmania kind of like around when the original Xbox versions were big.
151606	152206	He's a great guy.
152266	152826	We had him on the show.
153586	158108	and then Jim Sally says, then Rob's soothing voice brings me down and I get all snuggly in bed.
158448	160910	I'm not sure how to take that, but all right, sure.
160990	162490	Whatever floats your boat.
162750	165332	Whatever gets you to listen live with us.
167092	169974	Anyhow, so usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week?
170074	173475	So I think we'll get into that and then we'll come back to the housekeeping thing we want to talk about.
173515	174596	So let's talk about our gaming weeks.
175036	176597	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
176657	177277	I played shit.
177697	178357	Okay.
179998	180859	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
199462	200663	I played some P.O.P.O.
201744	207407	and I think Dan played some Metroid Fusion but I mean we're just you know bopping through a few games here and there.
207427	214571	It's like Game Boy Advance made a comeback this week between that and the 3DS news which I know is coming up later but everybody knows those games came out so.
215371	219674	Also we actually put the Saturn up because we're tired of Christmas nights.
220654	220914	Oh well.
222695	223736	Christmas is cancelled.
227266	230230	I don't care to play this anymore.
230730	232552	No other holiday games to get you in the mood?
233373	233573	No.
233693	235575	You don't want to dance to Silent Hill in the DR?
236096	236897	Wow, Winter Veil?
236917	238739	I've been doing this stupid Winter Veil shit.
239880	244906	No, finally, thank you Shane for making me an orc DK so I can throw snowflakes at you.
245953	273685	I don't even know if he's listening if you're listening, if you're not there's Rick Perry again he made a draenei priest for me to throw snowflakes at named For Jamie I think when I and just so people know there's certain achievements in WoW where you have to find characters around the holidays for instance the Easter one or whatever they call Easter in WoW, I can't remember Noble Garden Noble Garden, that's it
274185	294499	you have to find female characters of each race level 18 or over and it's called Shake Your Bunny Maker and you have to turn them into bunnies and they have to be level 18 or older I can tell you this because I'm a female dwarf which is like a freaking unicorn in WoW and I can't tell you how much I get turned into a freaking bunny when that holiday comes around
294993	297955	Freaking goats are easy to find.
298075	300796	So I made a rogue for whatever the last holiday was.
300836	302997	You had to do something with a blood elf rogue.
303037	304318	I don't remember why I did it, but I did.
304618	305799	And I named it Oops, I Pooped.
306159	306439	Yeah.
307720	308981	Yeah, I remember that one.
309001	309901	You made it for me to find.
309921	311062	Because I still haven't deleted it.
311262	312222	I thought you had a troll.
312883	314764	I did, but I deleted the troll so I could make the rogue.
314864	317505	No, that's right, because I had to go run to you.
317925	318746	Yeah.
319646	320567	Stupid silver moon.
321727	325728	But yeah, so I've actually been playing Peggle in WoW 2 now that it works again.
326188	326408	Nice.
326589	334551	But right now the thing that I'm trying to get is I have to kill 10 more people while dressed as a gnome in a Santa costume.
334791	335331	Oh yeah.
335891	338792	I don't like how it kind of forces you to do PvP if you want to get all the achievements.
338812	339212	I know.
339352	342733	And then like you get killed and you lose the disguise.
343133	348895	All I have to say, when that stupid kids holiday comes up, you are going to want to kill something.
349055	349755	I mean it's just.
350415	351616	Actually, I want to do BB King.
352956	354317	That's not too bad.
354597	360180	BB King is where you go to the major horde cities and you have to shoot the leaders with a BB gun.
361400	364021	Like I'm going to go shoot Sylvanas in the ass or something.
364261	367083	Anyway, should I save the WoW talk for the other show?
367963	369163	HordeHouse.com We'll have you back on.
370644	370944	We might.
371365	372786	Episode 50 is coming up very soon.
373626	373927	When?
373987	378370	I just have to convince Extifer we should tape more often than every other week, but that's another story.
378870	385395	Well, I also got some games on Steam because I got the Humble Indie Bundle thanks to Rob, and I started Cave Story.
385976	389639	And then Dan's like, I was like, I'm kind of tired of playing because we've had a busy day.
390179	391480	Dan's like, uh-uh, play more.
392241	393722	So he's watching me play Cave Story.
394192	394972	That doesn't usually happen.
395032	398034	Usually you're watching him play stuff, so that's cool.
398594	401516	Okay, check out this elder thing, Rob.
401876	402236	Nice.
402256	403857	It's like an old school gamepad.
403877	404557	My old controller.
405458	407119	You should put a picture of that on OLR.com.
407779	408199	I might.
408259	411081	It's actually not the one that I used when I played.
411101	412081	What brand is that?
412161	412821	It's a Gravis.
412982	413802	Gravis, ah, yeah.
414002	417543	It's not the one that I used when I played Final Fantasy XI.
417963	419023	This is the older one.
419083	423525	That kind of to me looks like what the PlayStation 3 controller was going to look like.
423545	426566	It kind of has that boomerang thing going on a little bit.
427066	427726	Just a little bit.
428486	431387	It's not quite as tacky as that other controller was.
431647	432928	It's actually fairly comfortable.
433609	435411	I mean, because, you know, my hand's all fucked up.
435831	436031	Yeah.
436572	438474	I'm sorry if I sound like I'm kind of high.
439315	440095	But you are!
440275	442157	No, I had half a beer.
443038	445901	And I've been allergies all day.
446281	448644	So, because of all the dust we've kicked up.
449424	453407	So yeah, I played Cave Story and then I got another game just randomly.
454107	459250	I happened to see it up on Steam and I was like, that was kind of pretty.
459631	460891	I'm going to get it because it's pretty.
461372	467356	It was a game called Fractal that you have these little hexagon shapes.
468957	473820	And for those who don't know their roots, hexagons are six-sided polyhedrons.
474960	476181	What's a polyhedron?
476401	477801	Your butt.
478361	486684	So you have to form, attach something of the same color to all sides of it and then it'll explode, but you have a push.
487624	493406	So say you have to push in the spaces around them and you get a certain color that you'll push with.
494026	501849	And like say that you're only on one side, well you only push in one side, but say that you push in the dead center of a circle of them, it'll push them all out, all in that color.
502789	520974	so you have to make the little all six sides of one touch and sometimes you can get multiple they're called blooms and you get point multipliers and you also get little ones that if you hit them they destroy everything around them and all this stuff but it's really hard like I'm only on the tenth stage and there's a bunch of them
521374	526257	and you have to get like 320 breaks done.
526838	528359	And like the most I can get is 240.
529660	530460	It's tough.
530480	532181	But you were telling me the music kind of adds to the game, right?
532201	533522	The music is very trancy.
533542	534843	It's very ambient trance.
535263	545230	And as you do better, as your score goes up in that level, it's like, for example, when you break one blossom, that's seven points.
546111	547471	If you get like a double, you get 14.
548012	551114	They call it an awesome blossom if you get a double.
553356	560962	Anyway, as you get more points, the music gets more complex.
561642	569829	But when you run out of pushes, like when you get down to like five pushes, the music starts going really slow.
569929	571170	And it doesn't change in pitch.
571851	572711	It just changes in tempo.
573872	578517	So, it's just like, you know, really slow.
578617	582881	And then you're on your last push and then it just stops.
583682	586825	And one thing that I really like about it is actually the type design in this game.
586905	588207	It's really pretty.
589068	589388	Of course.
589904	597350	Well, your levels come out on a diagonal when it gives you all your level information and your scores.
597490	606537	I'll try to go in and do a screen cap of a level so that I can show people what it looks like, but it's a really gorgeous game.
607318	614223	And when you choose your graphic settings, you have good, bad, but when you start going better, you have beautiful.
616025	616885	So it's pretty cool.
616945	619027	And it starts off asking you if you want to play it windowed.
621556	623921	It looked pretty from the two seconds I saw you playing it.
624141	624823	Yeah.
625023	625164	I'll...
627299	629220	I'll put some screencaps up.
629280	632621	It's like six bucks right now on Steam, so go get it.
633282	635083	All of you go get it so that they'll make more.
635803	638664	And maybe they'll make a tutorial so that it's not so freaking hard.
640545	643787	It's one of those games that's so hard that it pisses you off until you have to beat it.
645307	646688	I'm so mad I will conquer you.
648349	648929	You whore.
649249	650630	Going on to Loki.
650710	651370	How was your gaming week?
653059	653540	It was okay.
653800	656302	I played a lot of Skyrim.
658003	662786	Been exploiting the Dawnstar Hidden Khajiit treasure chest.
664648	666889	Actually did that for quite a bit last night.
667210	675596	It's very rewarding because you get a lot of loot and money and you get to kill somebody in their face over and over and over again.
675616	677877	I like that phrase.
678318	679879	Kill someone in their face.
681400	684461	You win the award of choice of words today.
684721	695207	And then, so I spent last night trying to take all the loot that I got from Dawnstar back to Winterhold.
696128	698989	And what else did I do?
699189	705653	Oh yeah, and then a little bit more in the quest of A Night to Remember, which is funny because it's like a
707577	713299	This big long chain of random things that you did while you were drunk one night because you blacked out and can't remember.
713319	715140	So that was kind of fun.
715900	722163	And then I got Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land for the 3DS this week.
722183	723283	So I played lots of Mario Kart 7.
723604	728265	I finished all the tracks, or all the circuits I guess, in 50cc.
729366	732107	And I started to play some 150cc stuff, but
733800	742767	Man, I mean, seriously, Nintendo, I understand you gotta ramp up the difficulty for 150cc, but the Rubber Band AI is just so retarded.
743467	752754	It's just ridiculous, the amount of... It's like, do I really need to be hit with, like, two blue shells, five red shells, and, you know, lightning all at the same time?
753035	756677	Oh, and thank you for doing lightning right as I'm jumping over a cliff.
756717	760580	It's like I'm playing with fucking assholes in, you know, Mario Kart 7.
760620	760860	I mean...
761781	763703	It's just, the computer's like, Ha!
763883	764663	Suck it, bitch!
764743	770508	You're over a... You're in the worst spot possible for a lightning bolt, and lightning bolt, that's what you're gonna get.
772249	772750	I hate that too.
772770	776913	They always seem to know right when you're going over a big jump and that's when they're going to hit the lightning bolt.
777054	778134	Or right before you get there.
778855	780356	That's irritating.
780416	783559	It's like I'm going to be way ahead of everybody and all of a sudden here comes Mario.
783579	785761	It's like, oh, I'm sorry.
785821	791706	Mario got like five superstars in Infinite Boost all at the same time.
791826	794369	Oh, and he's a dragon and it flies now for some reason.
795729	797010	But yeah, it's a fun game.
797030	797550	It's Mario Kart.
797570	798331	I mean, what do you expect?
798851	801872	I did like some of their choices, though, for the retro courses.
802252	808956	Although, like I say, my least favorite course in that game has to be probably the Neo Bowser City.
809016	810196	It's just such a waste.
810776	814758	I mean, it could have been cool, but it's just like, you know, I don't know.
815158	816059	It's such a waste of a course.
817240	825548	BlackWolf in our chatroom, of course the man, Bobby BlackWolf, who comes on before us here at All Games Radio, says Mario Kart is the original Asshole Mario.
826249	828351	You ever seen that mod for Super Mario World?
828551	829392	Asshole Mario?
830172	831574	That's a very good comparison.
831674	835558	I don't remember the AI being that bad in the original game and stuff.
835598	837079	I mean, One for the CC was pretty hard.
837119	837880	It was pretty bad.
838240	839360	I need a shell that kills first place
864122	864743	It's the ribbon.
865023	875373	But no, no, the lightning bolt was supposed to be your, that was in the original Mario Kart, and the lightning bolt was supposed to be the, like, fuck everybody up thing, you know, and that was like the, I am in control, I am powerful, you know, pass everybody.
875413	876374	Blue Shell, too much.
876874	882259	And I don't like that all the items aren't, I mean, it gives you better items, obviously, in the further back that you are.
882600	884361	Fuck that, it should be even all around.
884381	884461	Yeah.
885442	890483	Why should I be getting green shells and banana peels for being in first place?
890563	898225	I will say though, online, I got one of those seven power-ups that gives you just seven freaking items and bam, bam, bam, just firing them all.
898385	903346	That was pretty awesome and I made up a lot of space with that one and I know people didn't like me.
903806	906086	But here's the thing, I think that power-up sucks.
906427	907707	I think it's useless.
907787	908307	It's just like...
910002	910723	Are you kidding?
910903	912364	I fucked some people up with that.
913004	913504	It was awesome.
913884	915185	Alright.
916326	917546	So, yeah, Mario Kart.
917666	918287	It's pretty awesome.
918527	920708	Looking forward to playing it online.
921749	922069	What else?
922169	923189	Oh, Super Mario 3 Land.
923309	927672	I can't really say too much about it because I really didn't get a chance to play it much because I've been playing mostly Mario Kart.
928172	935236	I did try a little bit of it and I got through maybe a quarter of the first stage and the very first level and then I had to quit.
935316	938718	So, I mean, it looks pretty and it plays like a Mario game.
939738	942781	Um, I don't know, that's really all I can say right now.
942801	946044	I mean, it kind of reminds me a lot of, you know, Mario 64, I guess.
947686	953091	Um, but the setup's kind of a little bit like Mario Galaxy, but, I mean, that's it.
953171	954672	I mean, I'm looking forward to playing more of it.
955993	959877	Although, I'm looking forward to playing more Mario Kart than I am Mario 3D Land, so, eh.
962872	965255	And then, what else did I play?
965775	970421	Oh, I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 3, the 10th anniversary edition on my iPod.
972423	973625	And it looks nice.
975111	983033	But damn, I really wish there was Bluetooth support for some sort of controller because it sucks trying to control that on the... I knew the touchpad was going to be terrible for that.
983053	987754	Well, I mean, it's good for touch controls, I guess.
987894	992935	But there's not a lot you can really do with touch controls on a game like that.
992975	996216	I mean, they have it set up, it makes sense, but it's just...
997156	1000238	Touch controls suck all the time for a game like that.
1000298	1005921	I mean, I even tried playing some of the Gangstar stuff before, and it just doesn't work.
1006541	1008322	But it looks nice.
1008602	1015726	I just hope that someday Apple will wise up and actually have some sort of controller that would work with some of these games.
1015866	1021009	I know that some third-party companies have done that, but obviously most of the games don't support that.
1021089	1024531	Yeah, that thing for the iPad is pretty awesome, the little arcade machine that you can put
1025231	1035756	A co-worker of mine had this awesome keyboard looking thing that the iPad plugged into the top of the flat keyboard and it made it look like a laptop that you could touch the screen on.
1035776	1036697	It was nice.
1038298	1046922	It would be kind of neat if they did something like that because it really sucks that some of these games just the touch controls are not good.
1048923	1049743	Alright, anything else?
1051133	1068747	words of friends because my wife wants me to play her and so I'm playing a little bit of that and please I've been getting invites to SimSocial I am not fucking playing the SimSocial so you can just save yourself some time and do not send me any more invites for that game
1070208	1094055	I'm over it too Alright, quickly, getting into my gaming week Not a whole lot Oh, Call of Duty Shush, you're done Not a whole lot of new stuff in my week Still more WoW, still more Saints Row the 3rd Which is fun I'm loving all the little activities in that game It is so over the top I never thought I would enjoy this game as much as I do But Loki, I hate to say it, you were right You were so right, this game is great I love it
1094876	1097918	I played one of the Tron things, like the bike thing.
1098298	1101241	It's kind of like light bike mixed with the Sonic 2 bonus level.
1102442	1103103	Let me put it this way.
1103523	1110609	It's kind of basic, but it does Tron better than the Tron PS3 game did bike racing, which was awful.
1110969	1112951	The bike racing killed that Tron game.
1112991	1113652	It was so bad.
1114232	1114452	So...
1115553	1120958	I thought it was weak, but it's still better than Yaris.
1122159	1122660	But not by much.
1123721	1124061	Let's see.
1125102	1126823	Also, some new games I've been playing.
1127384	1133570	Not really a new game, but like DarkSakura, I bought the indie bundle, and I can't stop playing Cave Story, which is like a years-old game.
1134270	1141297	It came out in a new one on the 3DS, but Cave Story Plus, to be specific, is the one that you get with the bundle if you pay more than the average.
1142017	1142637	I love it!
1143037	1163522	Like, if you haven't played this game, you should definitely, I mean, for one, this indie bundle that's out right now is amazing, and I know there's a story coming up on the show later, we'll tell you all the games that are in it, but it's just such a great cause, great deal, great games, and especially the games you're getting this time around, like what, Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner?
1163743	1165343	Yeah, you convinced me of Bit.Trip Runner.
1165931	1167432	Bit.Trip Runner is a great game too.
1168513	1172897	But Cave Story, it reminds me of an old NES game, obviously, with the graphics and the music.
1172917	1176220	The music's great, and I guess now you get the soundtracks, which is awesome.
1177021	1181665	And it kind of reminded me, I wanted to say, I don't know why, but Fushanadu, you remember that game?
1182545	1209947	it kind of reminded me of that a little bit even though it wasn't really the swords but it was kind of like that exploring the different multiple screens and kind of the music reminded me of it a little bit so yeah, Cave Story's awesome I like that game and otherwise been playing some old school Game Boy Advance games as a 3DS ambassador namely WarioWare is the one that I can't stop playing the original WarioWare was so good and I'm so glad that that's a part of the ambassador package because that alone is worth it so
1210367	1212869	Yep, that's pretty much it for my gaming week, otherwise.
1215150	1216651	So we're going to move on into some housekeeping.
1216671	1219193	Before I get into housekeeping, I want to talk quickly.
1219593	1223696	We're going to have an interview in a little bit, and it's with my friend Justin.
1223736	1228099	He's going to call in in about five minutes or so after we get through some other announcements here.
1228700	1231902	And he's going to talk to us about his Xbox hack experience.
1232462	1246964	and I know you guys have heard about mine and I came on here and I bitched about it and how I couldn't play my Xbox for 20 days and it was pretty bad and all this but like my story has got nothing on what you're about to hear Justin talk about and I thought it was important
1247685	1255329	to get it out there that this is happening because when you guys hear the hoops he's jumping through and what's going on, your jaw will be on the floor.
1256210	1256970	He's not making it up.
1257010	1257571	It's all legit.
1257791	1258731	I trust Justin.
1259152	1266396	Justin met at E3 and we hung out and stuff, so I know it's all legit and you're going to be shocked.
1266836	1267797	So we'll get to that in a little bit.
1267857	1270378	But first, some important housekeeping we wanted to cover tonight.
1270918	1273600	There will be no show next week, most important.
1274220	1275901	Our show happens to be on December 25th, which...
1277242	1277402	Heathen
1293553	1300580	Also, I said on Twitter and I said on Facebook, and I wasn't lying, we have to say goodbye tonight.
1301361	1302983	And things change.
1303964	1308888	And DarkSakura, well, do you want to tell the listeners what's going on?
1309109	1310790	I don't know how much you don't want to say.
1311991	1312592	I'm leaving.
1314874	1315375	I'm moving.
1318183	1320466	It's been coming for a while and it's finally happened.
1320847	1323811	And I know I've brought it up before, but the move is actually happening.
1324893	1328318	We had Pack Up and Be Out and so we are moving...
1329881	1330842	Down the Street.
1332863	1336185	So we're saying goodbye to the Orange Lounge Radio studio.
1336305	1337465	Yeah, this one.
1338446	1339026	Bye.
1339166	1341168	But maybe you made someone's heart skip a beat there a little bit.
1341688	1343189	I'm so awesome.
1343349	1348772	It was looking pretty scary there for a minute that you might have to move further than a block.
1348792	1355656	Dan still wants us to go to Washington, but I'm like... So this is the fifth... You will still have a Shermie at your feet.
1356016	1356876	Yes, I will.
1356916	1357417	That'll be great.
1357937	1360638	This is the fifth studio that we've taped Orange Lounge Radio in.
1361498	1364679	The first was that house that I had with Brian back in the day.
1364719	1368220	I don't think it ever came on the show, but that house was the first studio.
1368260	1370361	The second studio was when Loki and I lived together.
1371582	1375783	The third studio was when Extifer and I lived together, and that was a lot of change for the station.
1375803	1379064	That was the studio where the news came out and filmed us.
1379104	1381665	That was the studio where we switched to All Games Radio.
1381685	1381965	What's that?
1384026	1385327	They also came to your guys' place.
1385727	1386347	To yours and Loki's.
1386507	1387367	Oh, that's right.
1387487	1388868	Oh, the paper did.
1388908	1389268	Yeah, yeah.
1389788	1390288	Thanks.
1390388	1391948	I got a foot on there.
1393369	1394189	Fantastic.
1395189	1396290	So, let's see.
1396370	1398730	And then the... The news did come here.
1399391	1402412	The fourth studio was when I was in the house in the garage.
1402692	1403132	In the garage.
1403212	1403712	The cold.
1403972	1405913	The one that's on Justin TV.
1405973	1407693	Super hot sometimes.
1408733	1410594	The garage with no steady temperature.
1410959	1414165	And then we've been in this studio for well over a year.
1414727	1416771	It's been at least, yeah, probably almost two years.
1417612	1419276	But my house is comfortable and has a heater.
1421059	1422963	And Shermie, you've got Shermie to keep your feet warm.
1423797	1427979	So, um, and by the way, there's a, our chat's finally catching up with the buffer and everything.
1428019	1431301	Just reading, uh, some from our chat room, chat.orange.com.
1431341	1432842	Red said, you guys had me for a sec.
1433402	1435503	Uh, Bochikawa says, OMGs, I was scurred.
1435523	1438945	Uh, CatastrophicMagi says, yeah, my heart did skip a beat, Rob.
1439205	1443928	And DarthSpazinator sums it up best, damn you, DarkSakura, making us think you're leaving OLR.
1445208	1445909	Orange Rice said, oh you trolls
1473884	1475805	The office is going to be a little smaller.
1475945	1477386	I can tell you that, but we should be fine.
1477506	1480909	We also don't exactly know where Studio 6 is going to be.
1480969	1482310	We think it's going to be at DarkSakura's.
1482350	1485032	We just have to make sure it's going to work because it might come back to where I'm at.
1485073	1490217	So from an undisclosed location is where the next Orange Lounge Radio will be.
1490377	1492739	So it's going to be a whole new year, a whole new OLR.
1493159	1499424	But what an appropriate way to kick off our 10th year of radio from 2002 to 2012 with a new studio.
1502099	1502619	You know what?
1503240	1504421	I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
1504681	1505101	What's that?
1505201	1506242	Fuck you, Wells Fargo.
1507803	1508543	What's that for?
1509024	1510264	Oh, I got it.
1510305	1511245	Yeah, yeah, why we're moving.
1511265	1511705	You know what?
1511826	1524874	Honestly, it's not even... It's a case of overextension combined with the housing market drop is what facilitated our situation.
1526355	1529577	But man, I tell you, apartments are freaking expensive.
1529597	1530498	Yeah.
1530738	1551733	and then like we got a house for what apartment rent for a smaller place would have been so it's really expensive where Dan works too but I mean so right now though and we got a good landlord who is really gonna work with us so and honestly we found his house called him the next day two days later we're in nice
1552213	1553394	So yeah, it worked out really well.
1553755	1558118	I'm sure people who followed me on my Facebook knew about the drama.
1558158	1562502	TigerClaw on chat says, I guess the studio where you and Travis did the shows was studio number one.
1562823	1565365	I didn't count that one because we didn't do Orange Lounge Radio from there.
1565385	1566866	That was Under Sedation Live, a different show.
1567186	1568908	And besides, he didn't really call that studio one.
1568928	1570710	I believe that was what, the Masturbation Station?
1570730	1571791	The Masturbation Center.
1571811	1572992	Inside the Pleasure Dome.
1573933	1575394	Beautiful, inbred Sacramento.
1575454	1576515	I don't know, whatever he called it.
1576935	1579678	So, no, that didn't have a number.
1579758	1580619	That was Studio Zero.
1582080	1582521	Let's see.
1583682	1586144	And Zether says, I knew you guys were joking.
1586204	1586885	We're not joking.
1587185	1588266	We are saying goodbye to the studio.
1588286	1588687	We are moving.
1588767	1589047	Yeah.
1589167	1590268	No, we were joking.
1592052	1593193	I am leaving this house.
1593213	1593994	DarkSakura is moving.
1595537	1599121	We have to be out of here by the third so that we get money.
1602786	1606091	Bobby, just to let you know, our next step is to buy a house.
1607152	1607493	Good luck.
1608877	1612623	Alright, so we'll be back in two weeks from somewhere.
1613264	1614987	Welcome to adult life, kids.
1615307	1616829	This is what you have to look forward to.
1616870	1617791	Growing up sucks.
1618132	1619594	Life's gonna suck when you grow up.
1619674	1621116	When you grow up, when you grow up.
1621336	1622679	Life's gonna suck when you grow up.
1622739	1623961	It sucks pretty bad right now.
1624822	1627344	Uh, okay, so I guess that's, what else can we say about that?
1627384	1628886	I don't think there is anything else to say about that.
1629046	1631869	So, goodbye Studio 5 after tonight.
1631909	1641379	Maybe, the good news is maybe we can get a webcam again, maybe we can be better wired to stream games, because this studio was really kind of supposed to be, well, wasn't it supposed to be temporary?
1641840	1642080	Yeah.
1643461	1644942	You're on my drawing table.
1645222	1646543	It just kind of lasted.
1646783	1649364	Although I got it at Ikea and it's not really a drawing table, so whatever.
1649584	1652866	I have to tell you, though, our new house is super cute.
1652926	1653966	You know what I just realized?
1654146	1654346	What?
1654486	1656487	This is one of my old roommate's folding chairs.
1656807	1659068	I totally jacked it from him for this studio.
1659088	1659329	Yes, it is.
1659369	1659789	Oops.
1661309	1663030	So we can bring a piece of the old studio with us.
1663050	1663791	That's right, we can.
1663951	1666052	But man, this house, though, is super cute.
1666812	1668793	And we'll get to keep the pinball tables in the living room.
1669266	1679829	that's good, pinball tables are important our landlord walked in today because he came in to sign the papers with us and he looked in the pinball room and was like, what is this?
1681330	1687832	we were like, this is our coolness, sir he was like, I haven't seen pinball in years I was like, that's super cool
1689372	1690012	I'm a designer, damn it.
1690032	1691012	Give me design stuff to do.
1709901	1726620	Alright, I think we're going to move into some of tonight's news, but we need to be a little bit flexible because the interview should be calling in any minute, so we might have to kind of like, because this is a live interview tonight, so if you want to ask questions you can in chat.orangelandre.com So Loki, I guess go ahead and try to start us off here, we might have to kind of cut in in the middle here
1727080	1728140	Sure, why not?
1728541	1751370	If there's a report coming from Bloomberg saying, and this is basically saying something that they've already kind of rumored to before, Microsoft is going to create its own TV programming for Xbox Live, which is great, because I was hoping they would kind of do that, because as much as I like to see on-demand stuff for Comcast, which I can get by an on-demand, well, I used to be able to get via on-demand, but unfortunately now we have a...
1752330	1753590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1781215	1800096	I feel like if I want to watch something what I really need to do to make it work is to go queue it up on my computer in my playlist and then go to my Xbox and watch it on the Xbox I mean if you want to watch like popular YouTubes and things like that like that's really easy to find because it shows you the most popular what about like a stuff you're subscribing to is it easy to find that
1800823	1802926	Yeah, that does all kind of pop up.
1802986	1803727	It's not bad.
1803768	1805730	You can link it to your YouTube.
1805770	1814723	Basically, you say link to my YouTube account and it'll show you a code on the screen and you go run to your computer and type that code in while you're signed into Google and then it links the two together.
1814743	1815704	Kind of like how Netflix works.
1816885	1817326	But it works.
1817386	1820008	I mean, it's... Fantastic.
1820148	1820408	Why?
1820428	1821369	I don't know.
1821409	1822470	This sounds stupid.
1822550	1824412	Here's the thing, and I don't know if you know this, Loki.
1825212	1831177	You can't watch any clip that's been flagged for copyright content.
1831197	1837643	You know how YouTube will keep some of the copyright content stuff up, but it'll just have a link to whatever song is being used in it at the bottom?
1838404	1842787	Say, this has stuff from UMG Music Group, and click here to buy the song.
1842907	1844649	All of those are pulled from Xbox Live.
1845249	1870983	which I actually I get why because you know there's all the jukebox usage rights and all that stuff and they don't want to pay it but it does put a damper on some of the things that you want to really watch on YouTube but like I would think like okay like the way that Jamie and Dan have it set up they watch YouTube's a lot on their TV of like game playthroughs and stuff yeah but I don't think they should have to change that but not everybody sets up a rig like that
1871563	1872223	Here's the thing, though.
1872243	1876985	I understand that it's kind of cool that they have that and stuff, but I'll tell you this much.
1877025	1883406	To get a rig to actually watch YouTube videos on a TV is fucking dirt cheap.
1883626	1885627	I mean, so dirt cheap, it's ridiculous.
1885927	1889708	I remember actually one time, well, it was last year, actually.
1890688	1891308	No, actually this year.
1891829	1896550	I was doing that Project Under $100 thing where I was going to create a main cabinet under $100.
1898932	1901074	I didn't want to build a MAME cabinet out of cardboard boxes.
1901154	1903737	You came out with $101 and you were like, shit!
1904298	1906400	No, I was able to do it under $100.
1907361	1907961	I just didn't want to.
1908162	1909863	I still have the computer and stuff in my garage.
1910424	1911165	I bought the computer for $30.
1911305	1913547	It's a Pentium 4 for $30.
1913788	1917672	It's capable of running MAME and most of the games for it.
1918012	1922374	But a Pentium 4 computer can also run YouTube, I mean, I think for the most part.
1922494	1927376	And hell, you can even get like, you know, mini ITX computers or Atom computers or whatever.
1928697	1932919	Very, very dirt cheap if you want to set up something that's mainly for watching YouTube videos.
1933039	1939342	Or fuck, any other, if you have a computer at home, just move it next to the computer, you know, to your TV and you can watch...
1940462	1940622	Hello?
1940642	1940762	Hello?
1965162	1966183	What is up, Justin?
1966263	1968305	First off, thank you so much for calling in tonight.
1968905	1970646	You're on vacation or something right now, right?
1971807	1972127	I am.
1972187	1974589	I'm halfway home from Disneyland.
1974649	1979012	Me and the lady drove out there, hung out a couple days, and we're heading back to Vegas now.
1979381	1979781	Nice.
1979802	1982864	I saw you did my tip at Haunted Mansion on Foursquare.
1982984	1983305	Yeah.
1983805	1984065	Yeah.
1984125	1987729	I think you left a couple tips throughout Disneyland and I did whatever I found.
1987829	1988750	I probably did.
1988770	1989370	Well, that's awesome.
1989390	1992093	Well, anyway, Justin, thanks for calling in tonight.
1992333	1999340	I tried to give a little bit of background before you called in tonight, but everybody knows you're calling in to talk about Xbox hacks tonight.
1999360	2004184	And I got to say, I've been following your updates through Twitter because you and I got hacked squarely.
2004224	2004664	Okay, sure.
2031508	2034590	First time you ever found out your Xbox got hacked, what happened?
2034610	2035591	How did you find out you were hacked?
2036712	2041515	Alright, let me start by saying I am on the road, and if signal cuts out, you know, I'll call back.
2041535	2044678	But just let me know if the signal starts cutting out, we'll make it work.
2044918	2045979	No worries.
2046559	2052804	So, day one, back in August, it was like August, mid-August, say the 13th, 14th, something like that.
2053464	2058768	I get an email saying that my, what was it?
2059235	2065416	I got a purchase confirmation for altogether $125 worth of Microsoft points.
2065896	2067157	Was it all that FIFA stuff?
2067957	2068837	Was it the FIFA stuff?
2070337	2070658	What's that?
2070818	2073258	Was it the FIFA 12 stuff that it seems like?
2073438	2078079	No, actually, the FIFA stuff, mine had nothing to do with any of the FIFA stuff.
2078099	2081640	I've heard a ton of people getting screwed over by the FIFA thing.
2082845	2087847	and apparently that was because there's something you can do on FIFA where it equates to real money.
2087887	2094169	I guess that people are building these super teams in FIFA by purchasing players.
2094629	2100831	They have booster packs basically and then they're selling the killer teams on eBay or what have you.
2101351	2103692	So that's why people are getting screwed over with the FIFA stuff.
2103712	2105892	But mine was not related to that at all.
2106312	2109974	I got one confirmation for $75 and then another one for $50.
2112361	2116403	I found it probably a couple hours after it happened.
2117363	2121844	So I went in, I checked all my stuff, I had to reset my password to get in there.
2122345	2138310	Saw that they had bought a bunch of, I think they bought Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, some DLC for both of those, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, DLC for that, some themes, and then just some other mislaying and stuff.
2139025	2142488	but it was all just kind of random stuff and I thought that they had played a little bit of them.
2143589	2145990	So I called Microsoft, well first I called the bank.
2146571	2149893	I called Bank of America and I said, hey, fraudulent charges, yada yada.
2149913	2151855	They said, okay, we'll just take care of it.
2151875	2154197	The next day they had my money back so no problems there.
2154917	2159561	I called Microsoft right after I called the bank and I told them what had happened and they said, okay, well,
2160519	2161399	We're sorry this happened.
2161419	2169621	We're going to close your account down while we look into it, and we'll have this taken care of within 25 business days or something like that.
2169641	2171961	It will be no longer than 25 or 30 days.
2172401	2178923	One thing I want to jump in here and point out real quick, just one small difference between what you did and what I did, is that you called your bank first, and I didn't do that.
2179883	2181783	I called Microsoft first.
2182163	2182964	Oh, okay.
2183384	2189205	Yeah, I find that kind of interesting because I wonder if that's part of the reason why your story is going to take a different turn here in a minute, but...
2189685	2191466	Anyway, sorry, I just wanted to point that out.
2191486	2191766	Go ahead.
2192927	2203813	Okay, so yeah, I waited a little while, probably three or four weeks, and then I called back and said, hey, just checking in, just want to see what's going on, and they said, well, you know, we're still working on it.
2203873	2204613	I said, okay, cool.
2205234	2210657	So I waited a little bit longer, a couple weeks passed, and at this point, we're past the 25 days they had voted me.
2211117	2216860	So I called back and I said, hey, you know, you guys missed your deadline, I just wanted to get a status update, find out what's going on, and
2217366	2220128	You know, same as before, they were apologetic.
2220228	2221989	They didn't have any news for me.
2222029	2227912	They told me there's nothing they can do to figure out with any more detail what's actually going on.
2229053	2230274	And that I just had to stick it out.
2230794	2234196	So at that point, I said, well, can you guys hook me up with anything to make stuff for it?
2234216	2236917	They said, sure, here's the code for a free month of Xbox Live.
2237698	2243141	And they assured me that that would be on top of whatever time I get reimbursed at the end of the whole fiasco.
2243701	2246183	So I said, all right, well, free month of Live, whatever.
2247182	2248923	Hung up, went about my business.
2249324	2254087	A few more weeks passed, and I called back, and they said the same thing.
2254448	2256089	I whined about it a little more.
2256129	2259752	They gave me another coat for a month of live, and that was that.
2260728	2270310	A few more weeks passed, and this is the point where I start making angry Facebook posts and Twitter posts and Google Plus posts and just trying to let everyone know that, hey, I'm getting screwed over here.
2270410	2275351	At this point, you've said a few weeks, a few weeks, a few weeks, so you're talking like you're at 10, 12 weeks at this point, right?
2276091	2279712	Yeah, this is probably somewhere between two and three months.
2280212	2282653	Around two months is when I started getting really upset because
2283055	2284596	I wasn't playing my Xbox a whole lot.
2284636	2292418	I figured at least I'll have this all sorted by the time all the good games start coming out and I'll be able to play Modern Warfare 3 and all that stuff.
2292538	2298220	So what I really got upset was the day Modern Warfare 3 came out.
2298280	2306102	Now I'm not a fan of the Modern Warfare series, but I figured this was going to be the year I was going to get it and start playing with all my friends and get into all that stuff.
2306643	2310764	Well, I bought Modern Warfare 3 and then remembered, oh wait, I can't play online, so...
2311798	2318984	I called again that night, and I said, look, this wasn't a problem before, but games are starting to come out that I want to play, so I need to have this fixed.
2319304	2327030	And same thing, just, I'm sorry, but I can't help you, I don't have any more information, we're very sorry this happened, but there's nothing we can do.
2327590	2330532	So, what else can I do, you know?
2330612	2332534	I was starting to feel pretty hopeless at this point.
2332574	2334055	I said, okay, well, deal with it.
2334725	2339148	and I started playing something on my Wii, I think.
2339288	2341609	I went back and started playing Mario Galaxy or something.
2342210	2353697	So, a couple more weeks passed and I'm at the point where I'm telling them every time I call, like, look, I'm going to call every week now and keep on doing this until I get a result.
2354598	2356079	And I did so.
2356139	2361382	I kept on calling and every time they just would give me the runaround and say, no, there's nothing we can do.
2362623	2362843	So...
2363675	2376085	About a week ago, I got an email saying, hey, we see that you regained access to your account, so we're closing your case.
2376365	2376745	Have fun.
2377806	2381749	And I was on my way to work at this time, so I couldn't check on it immediately.
2381789	2388074	But when I got to work, I went online and I checked it out, and I still couldn't get to my account via Xbox.com.
2388114	2390136	It still said your account is temporarily blocked.
2390751	2394752	And to point this out, you're talking from August to a week ago, December.
2395172	2395392	Yeah.
2395613	2395873	Okay.
2395913	2397753	Yeah, from mid-August until last week.
2397893	2398233	All right.
2398974	2399814	So I got the email.
2399854	2401194	It said that everything was good.
2401634	2406076	I went to Xbox.com and found out that everything was not good because I still couldn't get to my account.
2406816	2411157	So I called them on my lunch break, and I said, look, I got this email.
2411257	2412818	I mean, this has been going on since August.
2413138	2415219	Try and understand my frustration here.
2415459	2419940	I apologize up front because I knew I was going to get hostile at some point during the phone call.
2421322	2450518	so I told them the whole situation let them read over my case notes gave them like three service request numbers I had told them you know I want to be able to play my Xbox now I got this email but I still can't get to my account and they said oh okay well go to your console and I said well I'm not at my console on my lunch break so they said alright well call us back later when you're at your console and at this point I really felt like I was getting ripped off here so I
2451142	2457183	I asked them if they could do anything like give me a year of Xbox Live to make up for because what's a year of Xbox Live?
2457203	2459564	40 or 50 bucks, right?
2460984	2463905	So I asked them that and they said, no, unfortunately we can't do that.
2464445	2465645	That's kind of what I was expecting.
2465705	2468066	So I said, alright, well, can I talk to someone who can hook that up?
2469186	2472507	And she said, well, let me talk to my supervisor but she won't be able to do anything either.
2472647	2476507	So the supervisor came on, told her the whole situation, asked her for a year of life.
2476887	2478428	She said, no, I can't do that.
2478628	2479308	I can give you
2480118	2481239	and two extra months.
2481279	2483080	We see that you already got two months before.
2483521	2487884	I can give you two more months and that'll make up for the four months that you lost and that'll be that.
2488645	2499693	And at this point, I'm a little angry because before, when I got those two one-month codes, they told me that those months would be on top of whatever time I was reimbursed.
2499833	2500553	Oh, right, right.
2500613	2506278	So I relayed this information to the supervisor I was now talking to and she said, well, you were misinformed.
2506378	2508479	We can give you two months or not.
2508719	2509420	Take it or leave it.
2510129	2518672	and so I, I mean, I never, ever yell at people on the phone because I know they have shitty jobs and I would hate to be answering phones all day.
2520153	2522414	So, I blew up at this point.
2522714	2524355	I just, you know, kind of let her have it.
2524415	2530697	I said, look, I mean, this has been four months and you don't, I don't think you understand how much trouble this has been for me.
2530717	2538120	I've been on the phone literally like five or six hours total with Microsoft trying to get this resolved and all because some jerk off
2538717	2543358	hacked another bank account or hacked into my Xbox account and spent a bunch of my money.
2543478	2546119	Like, I feel like I'm being punished for nothing I did.
2546899	2550540	And she was not very receptive to that.
2551520	2554901	She just kind of reiterated, I can give you two months on top of the two months we already gave you.
2555281	2555861	And that's that.
2556241	2557241	So we went back and forth.
2557261	2559842	You know, I kept on saying this is ridiculous, this is ridiculous.
2559902	2561742	And she kept insisting there was nothing she could do.
2563583	2564083	Finally,
2565029	2569792	She conceded and said, okay, well, I'll give you 500 points in addition to the two months.
2570072	2570312	Woohoo!
2570352	2571733	Yeah, exactly.
2571753	2571993	Five bucks?
2572013	2572613	What is that, six bucks?
2572633	2574194	500 Microsoft points would be... What does that translate to?
2574214	2574194	625.
2574234	2574394	Yeah, 625.
2574434	2576155	625, okay, so yeah, worth $6.25 to Microsoft as a customer.
2576195	2578877	And I told her, like, you realize you're about to lose a customer over, you know, 50 bucks, right?
2578897	2579157	Because...
2594598	2596380	All I'm asking for is a year of Xbox Live.
2597641	2599583	She just kept on reiterating she couldn't do anything.
2599603	2603967	So I took what I could get from her because my lunch break was over and I had to get back to work.
2604507	2615236	I left her my contact info and asked her to have her supervisor... Oh, right, I asked to speak to her supervisor earlier on the call and she said that he wouldn't be in until the next day in the evening.
2616618	2620341	So she was apparently the highest level person I could talk to at that time.
2622020	2651029	so anyway she said she would pass along my contact information to her boss and have him call me back which never happened by the way so later that night I actually sorry when I got back from lunch when I was back in my office I typed out that quick Google Plus post basically saying like this is what's going on this is you know an update because I had posted probably three or four times previous after each call and kind of updated everyone as to what's going on I don't know how many people
2651562	2652443	and Major Nelson.
2680131	2683974	and Major Nelson actually replied to me on Google+, but sorry, I had a bad experience.
2684354	2689918	Shoot me an email with your gamertag and your service request number and let me see if I can figure out what's going on.
2690599	2693141	So I sent him an email the next day.
2693221	2695623	He said, all right, cool, I'm going to investigate it.
2695703	2700466	And a few hours later, I got a call from Beth at Exceptions Management.
2701527	2705170	And she was, yeah, they have an Exceptions Management department.
2706471	2706711	So...
2707734	2708855	I spoke to Beth for a while.
2708916	2714422	She was amazing, super friendly, super personable, very empathetic, helped me get everything sorted.
2715342	2717623	Got my account unlocked for me while I was on the phone.
2717663	2722364	Waited for me to make sure I could get into it.
2722444	2730467	Just to make it clear, before you could get to this person who could actually handle your issue and take care of everything right there on the spot, it sounds like she had the button.
2730847	2733708	You had to go through Major Nelson to get to her.
2733748	2734088	Wait, wait, wait.
2734128	2734488	Hold on.
2734548	2735728	Let's step back even further here.
2736088	2739789	They have a department for people that make exceptions to the rule.
2740750	2741030	What?
2743303	2749706	And I even pointed out to her, like, you know, this would have been so much easier if the supervisor earlier could have just taken care of this for me.
2750046	2752067	And she said, no, they actually can't do that.
2752107	2753728	They don't have that ability.
2754148	2755589	But Beth, who I was speaking to, did have the ability.
2755609	2756509	They don't have the ability to help you.
2757370	2758190	Oh, my gosh.
2758350	2762572	Okay, so Beth or whoever, finally, it sounds like satisfies you.
2762592	2764934	Like, you know, what do they hook you up with in the end?
2765894	2769476	Yeah, well, so she took care of me, and she was like, okay, well, we're all set.
2770030	2775595	and without me even asking, she said, well, how about, you know, I know you asked them for a year before, how about six months?
2775615	2778517	That's, you know, I think that's what I could really get away with doing.
2778857	2782340	At that point, I was just so happy that she was willing to help me and all that.
2782460	2784402	She kind of offered it without me bugging about it.
2784462	2785803	I said, okay, six months is fine.
2786263	2792348	So she gave me a couple codes for, you know, two, three month codes to redeem and, you know, I was happy with that.
2792388	2794030	I got a little something for it.
2794110	2799134	I felt like Microsoft was trying to appease me at that point and I was just happy I could get back into my account.
2800250	2801271	So all's better, right?
2801351	2802531	All's well that ends well, right?
2802771	2803191	We're done?
2804152	2804892	Well, not yet.
2805392	2805792	Not yet.
2807353	2808113	We're almost done.
2808733	2811234	So I go home and I play a couple games on live.
2811274	2811995	Everything's cool.
2812175	2821659	Next morning I wake up and as I'm driving to work, I see I get an email that says, Hey, we noticed you added a new email to your account, which I did not do.
2822559	2827861	And it's some Oscar-418 at Hotmail.com or something random like that.
2828442	2832946	and so, I mean, yeah, I got hacked again less than 24 hours after this was all resolved.
2833126	2834647	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
2834667	2836789	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, put the brakes on, put the brakes on.
2836809	2837069	Hold on.
2837930	2840752	You were out of your Xbox Live account for four months.
2841513	2844295	Finally, thanks to Major Nelson, you get back in.
2845396	2846177	24 hours later.
2847338	2848459	24 hours later, you're hacked again.
2849840	2850080	Yes.
2850941	2854664	So, I said, screw this, I'm not talking to Microsoft again.
2855045	2856686	As long as I can hold on.
2857606	2858486	Oh, damn it.
2858526	2859566	Now we're getting the service drop.
2859586	2860127	Hold on.
2860367	2860967	Can you still hear us?
2861207	2861907	Hi.
2862687	2863387	Go back a little bit.
2863467	2864267	We lost you for a second.
2865448	2865708	Okay.
2865828	2866488	Yeah.
2866768	2868428	So I got the email.
2870309	2871369	Sorry.
2871509	2873509	I lost track there.
2873709	2879391	I logged in on my phone to Xbox.com, went to change my password and all that stuff.
2881691	2885112	As soon as I got to work, I deleted all my email accounts.
2885212	2885232	I
2885896	2895939	associated my account with new email accounts, changed my password to something completely new that's never been used anywhere, made sure that this person had not made any purchases on my account.
2896199	2897360	All my points were still there.
2897380	2898520	There was no activity.
2898940	2906482	So I just booted that email address off my account and made everything brand new, basically.
2906582	2908683	So far, since then, everything is good.
2908959	2914221	Okay, I have to ask these questions because the listeners will kill me if I don't ask these questions to get some things clear.
2915062	2918263	You changed your password between the first time and the second time, right?
2919324	2921245	Yes.
2921605	2922965	It was not a brand new password.
2922985	2924886	It was one that I've used in other places before.
2925307	2932990	So one theory that I have is that maybe this traces back to when all the websites and Sony and all that got hacked.
2933050	2934791	Maybe they got my...
2935595	2940219	Password from something like that, associated editor, but it was not my same password from before.
2940299	2941140	But it was still different.
2941180	2943282	They somehow got two different passwords a year.
2944463	2953010	Yeah, and I think, I was wondering also, maybe they hacked into the email account that was associated with my Xbox account, and that's how they were doing it.
2954011	2956272	Because if you have the email account, you can reset the password.
2956292	2959595	You can get a reset link sent to that email address.
2959775	2960696	That could make sense.
2960716	2963959	Maybe they did something like that, or maybe they did some social engineering and
2964662	2970126	I got a service rupture request to reset it or something like that, but you know, that stuff happens.
2970186	2971787	I'm usually pretty careful with this stuff.
2994608	2996630	We need you to log in here or something like that.
2996790	2997911	I don't click the link.
2998071	3000234	I open a browser and I type in the URL.
3001335	3003857	So I'm positive that I didn't get phished.
3004137	3006960	And that's an easy thing for a company to say, you know?
3007140	3010984	Put the blame on the users and make them think that it's not their fault.
3012676	3041530	so alright so since we gotta wrap this up and get back to the show at some point but I wanna just kinda summarize here you were hacked you went through four months of hoops finally after getting Major Nelson involved you speak to the super secret department of Microsoft who can actually fix things when you talk to them 24 hours later you're hacked again yeah and so I wanna I wanna make sure that I emphasize that Major Nelson once I got to that point
3042096	3042736	Super helpful.
3042776	3044396	Everything was taken care of pretty quickly.
3044956	3051318	Microsoft just really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the initial interactions.
3051798	3054858	When this happens, they need to be a lot more swift with this.
3054998	3070961	Their investigation team, as they kept calling it, needs to be more accessible and they need to get this stuff done faster because the fact that I had to get Major Nelson involved, I mean, I felt terrible trying to get his attention on Twitter because it was taken care of in the first place.
3071360	3083660	but once I did, everything was taken care of, so I don't know, I don't want to encourage people to just tweet at Major Nelson whenever things go wrong, but I mean, that's what I ended up having to do to make this work, and
3084045	3086627	That's just insane, you know?
3110632	3112253	But Microsoft denies there's a problem.
3112293	3113054	EA denies there's a problem.
3113074	3116276	Yeah, and I know that you got hacked, and I've heard a few other people.
3116576	3127383	Like, I posted, when this initially happened, I write for Nukesilla, so I posted a story on there basically saying, hey, I just got hacked, so PSA, you guys might want to change your passwords.
3127903	3132446	So I got a bunch of comments on there, probably half a dozen people saying the same thing was happening to them.
3133147	3135588	And I Googled around, found a ton of other people getting hacked.
3135969	3137630	So, I mean, it's not an isolated issue.
3137650	3139311	This is something that's happening a lot.
3139935	3147320	I don't know what the common thread is, but it's not something that only a few people are getting hit by.
3147800	3153523	I've talked to a lot of other people, like friends of mine, who said, oh yeah, I just had to go through that too.
3153824	3155204	So what happens from here?
3155365	3167112	Do you think this is something you can put behind you in a couple months and say, alright, whatever, I'm a Microsoft fan again, woohoo, Modern Warfare on my Xbox, pew pew, or is this like permanently damaged things?
3167688	3169930	I mean, there's definitely permanent damage.
3170990	3185521	I think it's insane that Sony got basically crucified for the hacks a few months ago, but I can't think of a single instance in which anybody actually got, there was any fraudulent credit card activity.
3185901	3188783	You know, I didn't hear of anybody actually losing money over that.
3189144	3193907	But this is going on with Microsoft, and it's widespread, and there's no press about it.
3195068	3196549	I mean, people aren't talking about this.
3197685	3201368	What can Microsoft do to make amends?
3202770	3209916	They need to fix their security holes, whatever they may be, or maybe send out a forced password reset.
3209976	3210917	I don't know.
3211437	3212759	They need to do something about it.
3213039	3218644	I think people need to be talking about this more so that people are more aware and they can go and change their passwords.
3219104	3223108	Oh, one more thing I wanted to add to my story because I forgot to mention it in the middle of it.
3223148	3223408	Yeah, yeah.
3225083	3229425	They called me about a month in and said they needed my console ID and serial number.
3230066	3233908	I did not have that with me, so I called back a couple days and gave it to them.
3234148	3237370	But they tried to use that as ammo when they were talking about how long it was taking.
3237790	3241272	They said, well, we needed the console ID and serial number, so that resets the timer.
3241672	3243753	And I said, well, you know, that was three months ago.
3245089	3248553	I just wanted to throw that in there in the interest of having all the facts.
3248733	3250635	How about look at where he's logging in from?
3260347	3286853	it took him a month to even ask me for that silly alright well Justin I gotta wrap up so we can get back to tonight's news but thank you so much for calling in and sharing the story with you I don't know what else to say I'm glad you got resolution from Microsoft but I agree with you Microsoft needs to admit there's a problem more than putting because what Microsoft's doing here and there's a pattern it's what happened to you it's what they're saying on the internet it's what they're saying to MXT they're saying the user base is the problem we're the problem we're getting fished
3287513	3288533	We're causing issues.
3288793	3290994	We're not providing the console ID numbers in time.
3291234	3295775	The customer is not right, is what I'm hearing from Microsoft.
3295795	3299176	It's definitely something on Microsoft's end.
3299336	3304598	I'm still going to play games on my Xbox, but I'm definitely going to be playing more games on my PS3 as well.
3306653	3308514	Hey, home just got a renovation there.
3308554	3309355	It's worth checking out.
3309415	3317679	Well, I was just going to ask now, did you have the same email associated with your PlayStation Network account as you did with your Xbox Live account?
3317699	3319080	Yes, it was the same email address.
3319300	3320441	See, so that's the thing.
3320641	3322482	That's why I was thinking it might have something to do with it.
3322682	3324142	DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?
3324162	3324622	Checking my account.
3351367	3354248	I recommend everybody do the same thing.
3354308	3355748	For God's sake, change your password.
3355768	3358169	Everyone listening right now, log into Xbox.com right now.
3358529	3360729	Change the email address associated with your account.
3361069	3363310	Change your password and change your security question.
3363590	3364950	I changed mine ages ago.
3365590	3367991	Well, not ages ago, but like about a month and a half ago.
3368331	3369411	Right, right.
3369811	3370012	All right.
3370032	3370332	Very good.
3370432	3372032	Well, Justin, thank you again so much.
3372232	3374933	And God, I hope it doesn't happen a third time.
3375473	3376153	What else can I say?
3377284	3378565	Well, thank you very much for having me.
3378685	3379266	All right, no problem.
3379286	3379766	Drive safe.
3380647	3382909	Oh, wait, did you want to plug your site or anything?
3383970	3384490	What's that?
3384510	3385871	Did you want to plug your site or anything?
3385891	3388994	I don't know if it's appropriate, but... Oh, yeah, absolutely.
3389314	3391236	Check out Nukesilla.com.
3392116	3399562	We're actually in the middle of a month-long review Nukestravaganza right now, where every day we're writing a review of a game.
3400323	3402805	First day, we wrote one sentence for the review.
3403145	3404627	Second day was a two-sentence review.
3404947	3406328	That was my Pokemon review, actually.
3407427	3409569	and so on until the end of the month.
3409869	3411250	So we're about halfway through that right now.
3411330	3411850	Go check it out.
3412110	3415952	It is blowing up over there at Nookzilla.com.
3416152	3416713	Absolutely.
3416953	3417633	Take care, buddy.
3419294	3419534	Bye.
3420355	3422256	Wow, wow, and more wow.
3422796	3430580	Apparently, MXT in a chat was saying that, oh my god, they did the same thing to me as far as asking for the console ID and serial number.
3432661	3432921	What's that?
3433122	3433562	Oh, what's that?
3434195	3436696	That they did the same thing to him Oh, MXT, really?
3436996	3447820	Oh my gosh I mean, think about it We don't have that big of an audience When you consider the entire internet We have, what, maybe 50, 60 people in chat right now, right?
3448701	3454523	And the fact that Justin's on the phone And one out of these 50 people is like Oh yeah, I'm going through this too What?
3455664	3456564	This isn't a problem?
3458547	3459207	for Donculus.
3461888	3462248	Wow.
3463088	3463908	Wow, wow, wow.
3464149	3472851	But it's the thing, though, is they're right in the fact that, yeah, it's not through... I mean, if someone's getting access to your email account, how's that their problem?
3472991	3482093	I mean, that's not their fault that someone got access to your email because you happen to use the same password that you use with the PlayStation Network stuff and that list got leaked out.
3482133	3486575	To be fair, Justin might have made a mistake if his email password and his Xbox Live were the same.
3486635	3487595	But, you know, it's...
3488055	3488435	and DarkSakura.com.
3508391	3513779	Change address line 2 in your account to read Xbox support do not assist with recovery.
3514339	3525074	That way when the folks look at your account and see it, they won't try to accidentally give out any information or make any changes or whatever if somebody's trying to get it done that way.
3525879	3526799	I find that interesting.
3526839	3527660	An interesting way to do it.
3528680	3533561	At the end of the day, honestly, I'm getting to the point where I'm using unique passwords on different websites.
3534342	3537582	And it's kind of a pain in the ass to remember them all, but it's like what I have to do.
3538563	3538943	So anyway.
3539263	3539503	All right.
3540003	3540423	Moving on.
3540463	3542244	We spent a good 20 minutes on that topic, but you know what?
3542284	3542824	It's important.
3543124	3544084	And Justin's right.
3544124	3545185	Not enough people are talking about it.
3545205	3546965	And I said that back in August, and I'm saying it now.
3547285	3552387	At least we're finally saying, okay, well, finally we're seeing that Xbox and EA's denying
3553047	3555691	There's a problem in warning people to not get fished.
3556032	3557454	I guess that's a baby step.
3559297	3561480	Yeah, but see, that's the thing, though, is they don't even...
3564242	3579636	Why didn't they just say, hey, you know, back... I mean, another video game console provider or something like that was hacked earlier this year and emails were leaked out.
3579696	3581798	You may want to check that.
3581878	3582718	I mean, I don't know.
3583099	3588223	I don't know if they can't say that because that's, you know, untactful or whatever, but...
3591363	3593103	I mean, obviously there's something going on.
3593343	3600545	Or maybe they need some sort of restrictions for how much you can spend in a day or something like that.
3600565	3603606	I think they need to just do the forced password reset.
3603986	3606646	And they don't want to get raked through the holes like Sony did.
3606686	3608387	They're scared shitless of what happened to Sony.
3608407	3612367	Yeah, but if they do a forced password reset, people are going, why are you doing that?
3612947	3616288	Oh, well, because there's a lot of people getting hacked.
3616508	3618549	I mean, they're not going to come out and say that.
3618929	3620429	It draws suspicion, so...
3621249	3622410	Alright, let's move on with news.
3622630	3625473	That took up a big chunk of time, so we want to quickly get through this.
3644166	3651531	and they're saying that they're thinking the original programming via Xbox Live Dashboard including the Majors Minute, Xbox 101, etc.
3651811	3655093	and also possible tie-ins with IGN and all that stuff.
3656714	3659815	Of course, they had MSNBC so it makes sense that they do that.
3659996	3660496	And of course...
3661236	3664338	This week they had the launch of a few more applications.
3664378	3672141	YouTube, TMZ, Verizon, FIOS, if you happen to have that.
3673002	3689970	And I believe, was it iHeartRadio, MSNBC, Muzu TV if you're in some of the European countries, Rogers On Demand in Canada, SBS On Demand in Australia, and RTVE in Spain.
3693333	3697697	Oh, and MSN Video in some of the European countries and BlinkBox.
3697737	3698538	I've never heard of BlinkBox.
3699579	3702001	All different streaming stuff there.
3702341	3703782	TMZ, I haven't even looked at that.
3703923	3705924	I actually looked at the TMZ stuff.
3706065	3707546	It's similar to the phone app.
3707686	3708487	It's celebrity gossip.
3708527	3713531	They go out and get the videos, the raw footage of celebrities walking out of famous restaurants and stuff.
3713551	3716194	They do a live show that I think is broadcast on Sirius and all that.
3717735	3724798	If you like Hollywood gossip stuff, which I don't think many of you do, but that might be a way for them to try and reach out to a different demographic.
3724818	3726079	Here's what I don't like about it.
3726179	3729660	I think it would be awesome if it was actually set up like TV.
3729780	3730821	Like you have channels.
3730841	3731781	It's just not...
3733562	3737925	It's easier for me to log into a computer and type TMZ.com or hit a button on my phone.
3738005	3741447	I don't think the Kinect interface is yet there.
3742188	3744149	If I want to go check TMZ, I don't go sit on my couch.
3745950	3748912	Xbox, Kinect, TMZ, Bing.
3749413	3753355	I think they should have live TV or something like that as an option.
3753375	3763162	They should have these TMZ channels where they have some TMZ shows or whatever they're on at certain times and then you watch it actually like TV instead of, you know,
3763642	3787380	Having to because I think that would be really cool and that would get a lot more people interested in it because it's in addition to their own TV they can actually watch you know the Xbox like TV instead of oh hey look I can keep all these videos yeah you know what you can do that with the PC and I'm sure most people out there have PCs even if you don't have an Xbox so why would you bother downloading this app and going through all this crap you know it's just it's more of a hassle.
3788994	3790875	Maybe once they have a remote control or something.
3791796	3793376	I just don't think Kinect is as fast as they want it to be.
3793396	3794497	They do have a remote control.
3794657	3794937	Do they?
3795237	3796998	Yeah, remember they have the little infrared remotes.
3798478	3799199	I agree with your whole thing.
3799219	3801920	It needs to be channel up and channel down or something like that to get to the stuff.
3801940	3803581	It should be like web TV.
3803661	3806942	Well, not necessarily web TV, but like IPTV or something like that.
3809621	3813042	Speaking of MSNBC, I want to break in real quick with some real world news.
3814063	3818384	What is it with world news going on in the middle of our show?
3818404	3822405	Because remember earlier this year, Osama bin Laden was reported dead and all that.
3822425	3823186	Who did they kill this time?
3823606	3830008	Well, they didn't kill anybody, but Kim Jong-il from North Korea has died, according to the Associated Press, and it's on MSNBC.com.
3830729	3833091	Oh, which I mean, not to be crass.
3833131	3835052	I mean, it's sad when a world leader dies.
3835173	3836714	I realize he's a controversial figure.
3836734	3843660	I'm just going to stay far away from that and just say I believe it was reported he was having he had pancreatic cancer related issues.
3843901	3847864	So, you know, and that was the same thing that got Steve Jobs, sadly.
3848064	3851027	So that cancer sucks.
3851227	3851828	That's my point.
3853655	3855136	So, there you go.
3855957	3862901	If that, I mean, allegedly, that's what, obviously with world leaders, they're always very secretive, but, you know, there you have it.
3863422	3865023	All right, moving on.
3865843	3867084	More gaming news.
3867104	3869826	So who's going to be making a Death Knight of him?
3871347	3871827	In WoW?
3871947	3872327	In WoW.
3872408	3878772	Yeah, I remember my friend from Horde House, Matt, had RIP Steve Jobs already for the big day.
3879232	3883255	All right, anyhow, the Circle Pad is coming out in the US.
3883515	3887857	That's, of course, a little attachment for the 3DS, an extra little thing there on the 3DS.
3887897	3891360	However, it's coming out February 7th, so it'll be out next year.
3891400	3893781	It'll be $20, which I guess is a reasonable price.
3893841	3894441	But here's the deal.
3894862	3896963	It's a GameStop exclusive.
3897523	3901146	Yet again, Nintendo has chosen to go the GameStop exclusive route.
3901626	3904428	But this time, I don't believe you can get it on Nintendo.com, can you?
3904488	3904528	No.
3905866	3906607	Thank you for watching!
3924816	3925497	I hate this.
3926237	3927538	You guys all know how I feel about it.
3927738	3928459	It's no secret.
3928919	3934123	I hate that it's all this exclusive retailer stuff and I'm not going to support it and it pisses me off.
3934464	3937246	I actually kind of wanted that circle pad but not for the reason you think.
3938107	3953819	I don't know about you guys but I've had my hand hurt playing Mario Kart because I don't think that the 3DS is very ergonomically designed very well because my thumb starts to hurt from the acceleration button and trying to use the shoulder buttons for a long period of time where you have to hold the A button down.
3954239	3980320	it's not bothered me in any other game to date like it doesn't bother me in Mario 3D Land it only bothers me in Mario Kart but I was thinking if I had kind of the extension that that circle pad provides that there's more rest for my thumb there and it might work better but I'm not buying it this way I guess I could import one but I don't like that idea either to be honest I guess I'm just going to have to wait for the 3DS redesign that will release the 3DS they probably should have put out in the first place
3982250	3983932	Yeah, they'll do a 3DS redesign.
3983992	3986415	But here's the thing I suggested to us on Twitter.
3987977	3988819	It's a peripheral.
3988899	3990941	There'll be third-party solutions for it.
3991422	3995567	And there'll be probably third-party solutions that are even better than the official Nintendo one.
3996048	3999032	So just wait to get it.
3999092	3999392	I mean...
4001718	4003219	There's no reason you need to rush out and do it.
4003279	4016985	And honestly, before we were saying, oh, maybe the reason that GameStop has the exclusive on Xenoblade is because they may have helped to pay for the import stuff.
4017025	4021106	But for the Circle Pad, I don't think so.
4021286	4026429	I think that's just, I don't know, unless that was part of the Xenoblade stuff.
4026849	4027249	I don't know.
4029011	4040135	Yeah, so I'm not happy about the whole thing, but I don't know what Nintendo has to gain from this, to be honest, by being in bed with GameStop so much.
4040395	4041396	Here's the only thing I can think of.
4041476	4042556	I hate that this is a pattern.
4042936	4052920	That they think that this is going to be a niche product, and that they don't want to save money, they're going to ship everything to one source, basically, GameStop.
4053660	4057921	They do this in distribution all the time.
4058201	4074084	Or even their direct retail partners is that these companies will, to save money, they will drop retail partners and make them go through distribution to drop the amount of locations to save on freight and just streamline everything.
4074104	4076625	So they don't have to ship to all these different locations.
4076665	4081326	They ship to five locations instead and let them sort it out from there.
4081947	4086789	So maybe that's what they're doing with this because they're thinking that they're just not going to sell a lot of it.
4088543	4089164	I think they're right.
4089184	4094007	They're not going to sell a lot of it because it's not a peripheral that's absolutely needed for some stuff.
4094508	4100532	It's nice, but once again, this totally screams that they're going to do a revision of this thing.
4102093	4103534	I can kind of see where you're going with that.
4103574	4105296	It is a bit of a niche thing.
4105476	4107897	The developers are kind of in a stuck place.
4107957	4113201	They can't really design games to require this, especially now.
4113421	4115323	I think Everett, they're not going to be able to.
4115883	4144467	well hold on though because the new Zelda game requires Wii Motion Plus which really wasn't a part of the Wii when they do a redesign of the 3DS eventually I think they could start to require it kind of down the line but I don't think they could it's going to be a good year or two I mean that's how long games take to develop anyway I think if they're going to start doing games that require stuff they better do it sooner than later because they want the least amount of consoles to be affected by it alright well let's move on to DarkSakura with some news
4146266	4150788	There's news, it exists, and this one is about Square Enix.
4152208	4157230	The Square Enix members site actually was shut down.
4157890	4164913	And according to Square Enix, they said that they were actually looking to see exactly how deep the breach goes.
4164993	4167034	It looks like it was indeed hacked.
4168334	4174015	So they said that it was a server that was used by members in the US and Japan.
4174495	4177956	And so they shut down the service so that they can see exactly what's going on.
4178316	4188178	They said they can't confirm that there's any possibility of credit card information leak since that server that was hacked doesn't contain any credit card information.
4188558	4190738	But they're going to look through it and double check everybody.
4191118	4193779	So if you were on there, your credit card's safe.
4194819	4196299	If not, ain't your problem.
4197785	4198545	So, there's that.
4202388	4204469	At least it's not, you know, your Xbox getting hacked.
4204949	4207311	At least nothing was taken.
4207371	4223400	But once again, though, if you have your email associated with that Square Enix account that, you know, may also be associated with a console, or, you know, you may share a password on that site that you also share on your console, you may think about changing that.
4223440	4223640	Just...
4225359	4226499	Just to be on the safe side.
4226859	4227180	Yarp.
4229220	4233001	So there's been a lot of lawsuits against Sony for different things.
4233201	4236502	One of the more popular ones is the other OS removal.
4237042	4242244	And there was a class action lawsuit actually with Sony about that.
4243184	4247625	And a federal judge has dismissed all counts of the suit.
4249686	4250466	It's interesting though.
4250586	4251647	I guess this is...
4253107	4256969	All of the claims have been dismissed, I guess, back in February.
4259311	4267375	But I guess they amended their claims, and of course they dismissed the amended claims as well.
4267955	4272418	And the quote they have from, I guess, Judge Richard Seaborg,
4272978	4273578	Too bad, so sad.
4295754	4315641	Yeah, so basically they allowed the people to keep the other OS, but they obviously had to decline the update, and basically it was well within Sony's rights to do that, whether you like it or not.
4315661	4320222	I think that's part of the end-user license agreement is that they can do that kind of stuff.
4320643	4321723	Isn't that what we were saying?
4321963	4339813	and technically, you know, it wasn't an advertised feature on the box even though it was something that they talked about in different developer conferences and E3 and stuff like that in the little fine notes there but it wasn't something that they go, hey, you can run Linux on this because, I mean...
4341014	4341815	I don't know.
4341835	4343475	You can put Linux on anything anyway.
4343776	4357083	Then again though, you can still kind of run Linux on it if you jailbreak it and give it an amount of time or some more time and jailbreaking will probably be legal soon enough and then you can do what you want.
4357123	4362206	But once again, they can also prevent you from playing online if they have that ability.
4365532	4373795	Although, I mean, if you think about it, this not only does, you know, the other OS thing doesn't necessarily just stop you from playing online.
4373855	4380777	It stops you from playing new games because new games require firmware updates that are included on the disc and those updates remove other OS.
4380857	4382838	So, it kind of sucks.
4384118	4385399	Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
4385999	4392721	I mean, just maybe buy a computer that do Linux instead of actually using, you know,
4394651	4418871	your Playstation 3 unless you're the military and then you can buy a whole bunch of them just specifically for that but it's just either going to be a computer or a game console they're busy curing cancer you can still do the folding at home without having the other OS stuff I never used the other OS I thought about it for a while but just never got around to it
4419673	4420994	I have a laptop with Linux on it.
4421014	4423476	What do I need that for on my... Yeah.
4423956	4428279	I think people are just looking for a reason to have their panties in a bunch.
4428737	4430418	Yeah.
4430698	4432318	So real quick, let's talk a little bit.
4432678	4438940	I'm sure we already kind of talked about this during kind of what we're playing this week.
4439020	4448863	But yes, in case you haven't heard, and you happen to have bought a 3DS early on, you're one of the early adopters, if you will.
4449304	4453485	You are, of course, going to get some more games as part of the Ambassadors program.
4454285	4458486	You'll be getting 10 free Game Boy Advance games as well, and this is kind of cool.
4459747	4464168	Some actually really good games in there, which I was very pleasantly surprised to see.
4465028	4472991	They include Super Mario Advance 3 Yoshi's Island, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare Mega Micro Games...
4474332	4483897	Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Wario Land 4, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, The Sacred Stones, The Legend of Zelda, The Minish Cap, and F-Zero Maximum Velocity.
4484418	4487900	Some of those games actually I recently sold with one of my old DSs.
4488460	4490641	I gotta say, some of those games have an H2L either.
4491061	4496525	I played the Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero, which I love the F-Zero on the GameCube, but...
4498634	4499996	F-Zero on Game Boy Advance
4520993	4524797	And I gotta say, Mario Kart 7, man, that's a good-looking game.
4525117	4529762	I mean, the screenshots don't do it justice at all, or even the gameplay video doesn't do it justice.
4530063	4530583	Right.
4530723	4532806	But, man, it's just really crisp.
4533626	4537531	But some of the other, like, Game Boy Advance, like Metroid is great.
4537551	4538552	Metroid Fusion, yeah.
4538652	4539913	WarioWare is amazing.
4540534	4541555	You know, there's a lot of great...
4541895	4542595	You know what's the best?
4543516	4545296	Even though it's not in the bundle, it's still the best.
4545897	4546677	River City Ransom.
4547397	4548217	What, on Game Boy Advance?
4548237	4548557	That's right.
4548638	4550078	Heck yeah, it was really good.
4550678	4552239	But that's not a first-party Nintendo game.
4552259	4554160	I think that's the one thing all these games have in common.
4554180	4556300	No, but I'm saying that it's a game that has aged well.
4556460	4563263	And hello, Super Mario 2 Yoshi's Island, which, yes, I realize is whatever they redid it as for the Game Boy Advance, but still, that's an amazing game.
4564003	4570949	And then also, one thing I read, kind of a little tip, because I know the Game Boy Advance stuff gets stretched out when you play it.
4571309	4575693	You can actually hold start or select while you're starting the game up, and it will shrink it down.
4575953	4581858	Yeah, funny enough, Kaijudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, Rob, did you play the Game Boy Advance games in small window mode?
4581898	4583399	Yeah, I actually didn't like it.
4583459	4586842	I didn't mind the stretched images, especially for, like, WarioWare.
4586862	4587282	It doesn't matter.
4587322	4587982	Those games weren't, like...
4588763	4589825	Cutting edge graphics.
4589865	4593350	But I can see where the stretch gets kind of yucky on some of the other games.
4593751	4595133	So I get why you can do that.
4595153	4595874	But it's too small.
4596094	4597496	Windows is too small when you do it that way.
4598538	4603125	Zether in our chat room is saying, you know, the Game Boy Advance F-Zero is more of a throwback to the SNES games.
4604505	4605245	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4623138	4624699	Well, I have some more stuff.
4624799	4627321	This actually has to do with Ultima Online 2.
4628943	4637629	There was apparently something said by Richard Garriott who was looking to talk to EA about publishing a new Ultima Online.
4638550	4645475	He said that they would love to have access to the Ultima property and had discussions with EA about it.
4646056	4649959	But EA apparently is not down for that.
4650019	4651660	They've said, no, we're not.
4651720	4652621	What's he talking about?
4653601	4656783	In fact, the quote actually says, I'm not sure what Richard Garriott is referring to.
4657503	4660645	So it doesn't look like that might actually be happening.
4661326	4667149	Maybe he's feeling a little bit sorrowful that Tabula Rasa didn't work out, the space thing.
4667769	4667909	Maybe.
4667929	4668730	Not really doing that now.
4668790	4674913	But there is something about an Ultimate Collector project that does start with Ultim.
4674933	4675073	Maybe.
4675093	4675133	No.
4675153	4675193	No.
4681286	4682907	Ultima was a great series, though.
4682947	4685287	I would like to see it make a comeback in some form or another.
4685327	4691550	I know they have the web game, I think was the last big thing I saw them doing, but some people are still freaking playing Ultima Online.
4692810	4697131	They gave it a big redesign a few years ago to kind of make it a little more current, so it's kind of cool.
4698052	4698392	We'll see.
4699815	4708303	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and check out what's coming out to an arcade, or excuse me, a home console, I wish an arcade, but to a console near you soon.
4709764	4710324	Uh, well.
4710565	4711626	Probably not a lot, right?
4711766	4712186	Yeah.
4712366	4719232	Uh, I hope you like Star Wars The Old Republic, because that's all that's coming out this week on PC.
4720974	4721214	Nice.
4721955	4722235	That's it.
4723644	4723924	All right.
4724244	4724664	It's pretty dead.
4725785	4728246	Let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out there.
4728266	4730747	Now, I do want to point out the Vita is out in Japan.
4730807	4733648	That was one of the big releases of this past week.
4733668	4737029	And, of course, you see a lot of the unboxing videos and a lot of stuff has appeared online.
4737089	4741490	I thought about importing it until I saw the $600 for just the console thing.
4741510	4741991	Oh, my God.
4742071	4742331	Like $100 each.
4743611	4745232	Fuck that.
4745332	4745972	No, thank you.
4745992	4749153	All right, things are a little more exciting in Japan than just one game.
4749213	4755736	This week on the Xbox 360, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 gets a dubbed version for Japanese release this week.
4756096	4766620	Divinity 2, the Dragon Knight Saga, and Musou Orochi 2 comes in a regular and treasure box edition from Koei Tecmo comes out this week on the Xbox 360.
4769162	4770004	Is this a fighting game?
4770044	4771186	I think this is a fighting series.
4771366	4773109	Oh yeah, it's a fighting series from Koei.
4773129	4777778	It's probably like a Dynasty Warriors Universe fighter.
4778630	4781953	Orochi has to do with a legend, an old legend.
4782994	4783454	What was it?
4783494	4784275	Was it Orochi?
4785276	4785476	Yeah.
4786096	4786897	Musou.
4787377	4787678	Yeah.
4788558	4789759	I think it might be all that stuff.
4791020	4793903	On the PlayStation 3, pretty much the same games I just mentioned.
4793943	4795804	Modern Warfare 3, Musou Orochi 2.
4796685	4798607	A couple extra games there, though.
4799607	4802109	GQ, Powerful Pro Yaku 2011.
4802150	4802470	Yeah.
4804591	4807012	Need for Speed Hot Pursuit gets a price reduction.
4807633	4812435	And next week in Japan, I've got to get this out there because we're not going to be here next week, The Idolmaster.
4814156	4817317	Gravure for You Volume 3 comes out next week.
4817357	4819559	I know The Idolmaster is a really big series over in Japan.
4820739	4822860	Going to some of the other consoles.
4822920	4825641	I want to check out at least the Wii and the Vita.
4826542	4829683	Nothing really on the Wii that I can see.
4831064	4832506	Rob, my name, my brain combined them into the WIDA
4847463	4867813	uh any late starts out the gate oh yeah ultimate ultimate marvel versus capcom 3 oh that's a general asia asia region release comes out this week and quickly let me look on a 3ds there is a looks like there's a branded nintendo 3s a gundam 3ds oh no the sd card it's just the sd cards
4868473	4869574	Oh no, no, this is the full 3DS.
4869614	4871415	Are they SD Gundam cards?
4871435	4878780	Yeah, yeah, like they're SD cards, little Gundam characters, and then they actually have a 3DS that has... That makes it funny because they're SD Gundams.
4879841	4881302	It was a series, SD Gundam.
4881662	4882142	I gotcha.
4882582	4887186	Well, there is a game also to go with it, SD Gundam G Generation 3D.
4887826	4889467	SD Gundams are so cute.
4890148	4890748	Alright, there you go.
4891008	4892089	That's your Japanese releases.
4892829	4901231	UK, on the 20th, Star Wars The Old Republic, and the 21st, Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD on PS3.
4901531	4901871	That's it.
4903612	4905212	Pretty quick series of release dates.
4905492	4905732	Chirp.
4906352	4907413	That's what happens this time of year.
4908013	4908773	All right, Loki.
4910694	4911134	All right.
4913704	4915085	It's always dead this time of year.
4915485	4920588	But thankfully, though, it won't be dead too long in the first quarter of next year.
4920628	4930473	Nintendo's announced their upcoming release list for their titles, hitting Wii and 3DS, and of course on Nintendo DS as well.
4930994	4935596	Some notable stuff, Kid Icarus Uprising, getting a date finally.
4935976	4939878	It's going to be coming out in March, and...
4944016	4950202	March 23rd, so that's pretty cool, wish it was coming out earlier than that, but whatever, I'll wait.
4951283	4957070	Other notable stuff, Mario Party 9 on the Wii, coming out March 11th.
4957470	4961755	Also, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond, on February 27th, also on the Wii.
4963337	4964478	Let's see, some other stuff.
4966127	4969349	They're also going to be getting some cool eShop stuff.
4970090	4980677	VVVVV for the 3DS will be coming out first quarter next year as well as Night Sky and Mighty Switch Force, Zen Pitball, and Mutant Mudds.
4981717	4986380	And I guess Kirby's Block Ball is going to be brought to the Virtual Console as well for the 3DS.
4989382	4992664	On WeWear, LaMulana is supposed to be coming out.
4992884	4994605	That's pretty cool.
4995346	4997207	Someone tell DT to keep it in his pants.
4997867	5001369	He's already well aware of LaMulana coming out.
5002010	5004011	He's on the pulse of LaMulana.
5005351	5021679	Rhythm Heaven, Fever that's coming out February 13th on the Wii that's also going to be $29.99 so a nice budget price for that honestly never got into those and of course the Circle Pad Pro will be coming out around that time
5023482	5029328	Alright, well before we get to the classic game of the week, I gotta share this story that's going around the internet this week, making its way on the gaming blogs.
5029928	5033572	A very interesting censorship issue going on on the Nintendo 3DS.
5033972	5039978	Imagine if you were Ashton Kutcher, and you tried to name your me on your 3DS, Ashton.
5041459	5045443	Nintendo apparently is censoring that name, believing that it contains...
5045683	5047004	and objectionable content.
5047685	5048505	Because think about it.
5049086	5051328	Ashton, if you spell it out, A-S-H.
5051548	5052629	Yeah, it sounds like a shit ton.
5053129	5055791	Or Aston, maybe?
5056031	5056492	I don't know.
5057192	5058974	So if you like Aston Martins, you can't have one?
5059014	5059654	I guess not.
5059774	5067941	So this poor guy named Ashton, I mean, it's not Ashton Kutcher, obviously, but that's a common use of the name where we would think like, oh, there are people named this in the world.
5067961	5070203	Because if it was Ashton Kutcher, that shit would be fixed.
5070223	5070503	Maybe...
5071664	5072084	Done.
5072425	5073025	Sorry, Mr. Ashton.
5092859	5118282	leave your take it or leave your so you can see this and he actually shows his me and then he shows what it looks like on his friend's system where it's replaced it with a bunch of question marks because apparently the name Ashton is objectionable now Ashton Kutcher I find objectionable but this poor guy who just happens to have the same name shouldn't have to suffer the consequence of Ashton Kutcher being crappy so
5120566	5124267	Man, wouldn't you hate to find out that Nintendo just suddenly deemed your name offensive?
5125107	5125567	It's stupid.
5125587	5126647	I'm offended by Rob.
5127748	5129468	Because I feel like you're going to steal from me.
5129528	5131588	It's like you're going to rob a bank or something.
5132129	5142171	Hey, well, it's good, though, that they, what is it, for the 3DS, they've patched it so that they can add DLC, right?
5142391	5144931	So does that mean they're going to be able to bug fix stuff like this?
5145211	5146612	Well, they have firmware updates.
5146632	5147732	They can do that in a firmware update.
5148112	5152577	That firmware update really did kind of, you know, it was like they changed everything in that console.
5152597	5156502	I mean, they overwrote some of the stuff in the Find Me thing.
5156862	5159605	They overwrote, it was a lot of changes.
5159885	5162008	So they can fix it if they want.
5162128	5162589	I know they can.
5163489	5165371	But they're not.
5166032	5167673	Not unless Ashton Kutcher tweets about it.
5168334	5169675	So somebody should send him that YouTube.
5169835	5176941	But they could do it, though, because remember there's issues with Street Fighter where it wasn't working correctly or Ridge Racer or something like that.
5176981	5178843	One of the launch titles was bugged or something.
5179083	5180605	Yeah, so they fixed that.
5185088	5189973	It's sad that... Because we're going to get into a story later on, but it's sad that...
5191548	5196770	Nintendo hasn't embraced the ability to patch games.
5197691	5198031	Right?
5199391	5199752	Stupid.
5200512	5204554	Alright, let's take a look at the classic game of the week.
5205374	5206474	I thought of it in my car.
5207055	5207695	Every week.
5209048	5209989	We'll see you next time.
5227358	5231303	DarkSakura, enough setup, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
5231323	5231483	Xavius
5247517	5250779	It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Namco and it came out in 1982.
5251480	5254081	You know what else came out in 1982, Rob?
5254742	5254982	What?
5255142	5255602	Tron!
5256223	5257323	Awesome.
5257844	5265008	It was a game done by Masanobu Endo and it was released by Atari in the US and it runs on the Galaga hardware.
5265288	5269711	By the way, I just have to say I find the background music on this to actually get kind of annoying.
5269731	5273153	I might have to kill it at some point.
5274699	5278542	In Brazil, the cabinet actually says Columbia for the game, but the software still says Xevious.
5279282	5293010	So you use an 8-directional joystick to move an aircraft called the Silvolo, which has a forward-firing zapper and a blaster that lets you send air-to-surface bombs down for ground targets.
5293550	5295291	And it's supposed to be set in Peru.
5295931	5295991	Ooh.
5297658	5300499	Um, so you have to basically just fly around and shoot shit.
5300880	5301480	It's a shmup.
5302420	5306182	You have 16 areas, and it loops back to area 7 after 16.
5307923	5311724	And, uh, you just keep going over terrain and shooting shit.
5312265	5321049	So if you complete at least 70% of the area before dying, then, um, like, when you die, then you actually will start at the next level instead.
5321749	5325331	It constantly flies forward, just like any good shmup.
5327291	5330753	You actually can make it through the whole game without killing anybody for the record.
5331893	5333854	Although, not really.
5333874	5334915	Where's the fun in that?
5335075	5335515	I know, right?
5336235	5337656	The challenge is not getting hit.
5338696	5345279	It is one of the very... I would have to put it in the first of the shmups.
5345459	5352662	It actually, an earlier one before that was Caverns of Mars on the Atari computer.
5355003	5356303	It was really, really cool.
5356323	5361125	It uses a lot of different techniques for it.
5361146	5366108	It uses palette shifting for color changes, and it's just really amazing.
5367929	5375072	It also had a few hidden bonuses in it that you could find by doing a secret maneuver.
5376192	5378134	One of them was a special flag from RallyX.
5379514	5383397	What happens if you find the flag, then you get an extra life.
5383417	5384677	It's in a bunch of Namco games.
5387979	5393723	And the slogan when this came out was, are you devious enough to play Xevious?
5395484	5398225	And then it says, the arcade game you can't play at home.
5398626	5400707	I'm going to play some of the music from the newer one.
5400727	5400987	Okay.
5406280	5414746	Well, actually there were pretty big music stars in Japan who were big fans of the games.
5415106	5426414	And one of them, who was Keisuke Kawata of Southern All-Stars, actually did an album that was all based off of Namco video games.
5426694	5428315	And Xavius was the centerpiece one.
5429296	5429616	And then...
5431477	5446488	There was also a 12-inch single that had liner notes and a science fiction story written by the creator Massimo Buendo that was set in the world of Xevious and had its own language included.
5447589	5455733	Um, there was also a three-part novel written about it called, uh, Fardrot, F-A-R-D-R-A-U-T.
5456834	5462597	Um, but the theory is that it doesn't sound like it was ever released, or if it was released, it was really limited release.
5463297	5464938	There were other games that came out in the series.
5465598	5470540	In 84, it was Super Xevious that was basically the same game, just harder.
5471840	5477122	And Solvelo in 1991, which was first-person, sort of.
5477182	5480703	It uses 3D flat-shaded polygons, and they only came out in Japan.
5481623	5488806	Xevious 3DG in 1995 was basically a 3D texture on top of polygons.
5489386	5491967	And two-player play only in Japan, although I've seen one.
5493028	5497652	Xavius Arrangement in 1995 that was part of the Namco Classic Volume 1 collection.
5498273	5500195	Also included Xavius and Super Xavius.
5501476	5506441	Grubda, which was a spin-off starring an enemy, a tank with corkscrew treads.
5507102	5507562	That came out in 84.
5509685	5521288	Also, new versions for the home system was Super VVS Gap no Nazo in 1986, which came out for the Famicom and the Nintendo Vs. I'm sorry, why is that?
5521348	5524368	Versus series in the arcades.
5525609	5527929	Basically, there's different riddles you have to solve to get through it.
5528609	5533750	There was VVS Far Dread Saga, which was an MSX2 game, and it was done by Compile.
5534231	5535851	Compile does amazing stuff.
5536371	5538312	You can actually pick from four different ships.
5538352	5542833	You have the Solvolo, the Solgrado, the Zeodali, and the Gamp Mission.
5543733	5549915	There's Xevious Fadrot Densetsu in 1990 that came out on PC Engine, also done by Compile.
5550576	5559738	And then Xevious Resurrection that came out in 2009 for PS3 as a downloadable, with the downloadable title Namco Museum Essentials.
5560199	5562459	Or it was called Namcomuseum.com.
5562940	5564040	Two N's in Japan.
5564721	5572197	There's also an RTS game called New Space Order that was done by Namco Bandai Games that has bits of Xevious included in it.
5573032	5585595	For different ports, we're looking at the Atari 7800, Atari 8-bit, NEC, PC Engine, NES, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Apple ST, Home Computer.
5585916	5586456	Everything!
5587316	5587576	Yep.
5587896	5590337	Re-releases, like I said, there was Namco Museum Vol.
5590497	5602040	2 for the PlayStation, which I have... The A. The Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade PC, 1998, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for Xbox, PS2, GameCube,
5602620	5605662	and PC.
5607243	5609765	It was not in the Game Boy Advance version, by the way.
5610866	5619972	Namco Museum Battle Collection for PSP, Namco Museum DS, Namco Museum Remix on Wii, Namco Museum Essentials for PS3, like I said earlier.
5620752	5624815	And it was also ported into the plug-and-play version of Ms.
5624835	5628197	Pac-Man TV compilation, the little plug-in thing.
5630138	5631219	There was also
5633721	5643327	A GBA release of the NES version on... It was an unlockable bonus game for Star Fox Assault and then came out on Virtual Console.
5645329	5646850	Like I said, there's just a bunch of them.
5646890	5648551	They tried to do a 2600 version.
5648571	5649231	It didn't come out.
5649892	5652413	It was part of Pac-Man's arcade party in 2010.
5653934	5661419	And 3D Classic ZVS, a 3D remake of the game, was available on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS.
5662900	5665281	There's a bootleg version, too, called Xevious.
5666502	5667642	X-E-V-I-O-S.
5667823	5668763	The U is absent.
5669143	5670504	Oh, that makes it a new game.
5672405	5681409	But really, it's just... All they did was, instead of saying 1982 Namco, it says 1980 Watson.
5682089	5683650	And they removed the Namco logo.
5684731	5687692	And... It's just...
5689281	5689962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5718121	5738060	and the explosion sounds are different as far as differences in the US and Japanese ones the names in the Japanese version are the pseudonyms of the games designers and composers and since the US basically let three characters in it didn't work and the zapper and blaster buttons were reversed between the versions
5739661	5741062	There's also references in Ridge Racer.
5742163	5744305	You get a car called the R.T.
5744345	5745786	Xevious Red and the R.T.
5745826	5746567	Xevious Green.
5747608	5749950	You get all three different versions of it.
5750370	5756635	In Ridge Racer 3D, one of the unlockable cars is called the Sovolo and it's piloted by Pac-Man.
5758056	5758536	Isn't that cool?
5758877	5759297	Very cool.
5759517	5760378	How about other references?
5761408	5766933	Star Fox Assault Tales of Symphonia Bakura Invincible Flying Panels Mario Kart, Arcade GP, and GP2 Namco
5786670	5810798	you also, one of Pac-Man's cars is the Sovolo spacecraft in Earthbound, music from Xevious can be heard at the Onet Arcade you can actually get the Sovolo ship as an avatar on PSN and it will be a downloadable aircraft in Ace Combat Assault Horizon there you go
5811892	5818737	Your classic game of the week, Xevious, and it's 50 gazillion different ports and reiterations.
5819537	5820318	I like this one.
5820438	5822159	I've never played this one, the 3DG.
5822539	5824300	I've never played that one, but it looks kind of fun.
5824761	5825641	You know what?
5825741	5829584	When I told Dan what I picked, he was like, Xevious is awesome!
5829864	5830805	It is awesome.
5830885	5834887	The other game that I picked, though, he was really excited about that, so I might have to do it next time.
5836548	5836849	All right.
5838502	5840223	Well, we're going to take a break.
5840584	5842005	We're going to do Mario Kart again.
5842085	5844047	We are getting in the OL Army room right now.
5844067	5847469	There's already five of us in there, including myself and Loki and Bobby Blackwolf.
5847650	5849151	So it's really... It's on.
5849631	5850552	And Tigerclaw.
5850592	5855276	So it's really like All Games versus Zether, who won last time.
5855336	5856337	So it's not looking good.
5858918	5860819	Team All Games has each other's back.
5860879	5861979	Dude, you are in trouble.
5862039	5862640	That's right.
5862880	5863520	You are screwed.
5863540	5867322	They're going to use a special turtle shell that just breaks out a paddle and spanks you.
5867342	5868262	Does Aether have a show?
5868322	5868763	Maybe he does.
5868783	5870003	I'm not aware.
5870083	5870363	Who knows?
5871004	5875046	Anyhow, if you have Mario Kart 7, hurry up and get in there in the OL Army room.
5875306	5876706	Quickly, write this down.
5876766	5877287	Get a pen.
5877447	5878167	Start punching it in.
5878187	5880928	40-5530-8176-7193 That's the OL Army Mario Kart 7 code.
5886571	5889834	Alright, we're about to get started while Lena Ha goes after a quick break.
5889854	5892436	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5898377	5902458	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5902558	5904478	And yes, we got our Mario Kart on during the break there.
5905418	5909599	It was weird because Zether took us to town both times.
5909659	5910600	He won both races.
5911160	5913540	So in Zether versus all games, Zether won.
5913860	5914720	So good job, dude.
5915561	5917801	And I came in third both times.
5918501	5920822	Loki came in last on both races.
5921162	5922102	Good job, Loki!
5923379	5926084	Yeah, it's because a fucking blue shell is hitting me in fourth place.
5926304	5929550	Blue shell stopped and then hit me in fourth fucking place.
5930526	5958461	but he's not mad or anything now what I find hilarious it's because it counted down I didn't even get the check set up my cart I got this like fucking terrible ass cart that I'm driving right now so I don't know I quit what course is that you guys are in right now this is one of the ones I don't think I've played yet Bowser's Castle and I'm not even my me is racing and in first place how sad is that my me does better when I'm not even playing laughing
5959662	5960383	So, anyhow.
5960744	5961305	Yeah, that was enough.
5961545	5966212	And Kaijudo in chat says, wow, that race must be epic.
5966232	5967293	This is a long time break.
5967313	5968375	We only did two races.
5968455	5971459	We had the Maple Treeway came up.
5971539	5974964	Oh, yeah, Rainbow Road from the original Super Nintendo was the first track we had to do.
5976346	5977227	Yeah, good times.
5977707	5980009	So Mario Kart 7 is playing on a break.
5980109	5981811	So we'll have to set up some more nights.
5981911	5984613	We've got to get more people to play Mario Kart 7.
5984793	5987055	At some point, hopefully, DarkSakura will get a 3DS.
5987075	5988676	She can join us in the Mario Karts.
5988696	5989357	Somebody buy me one.
5990538	5992459	Man, I'm looking at this thing.
5992479	5993440	These people are crazy.
5994081	5995142	What thing is crazy?
5995862	6000046	This family that builds a 100,000 brick Lego model every Christmas.
6001907	6003128	Did my Mii come in first?
6003669	6003949	Oh, no.
6004349	6005110	Zether still beat me.
6006448	6007048	That's sad.
6007688	6007949	My me.
6007969	6008769	You built a Dalek.
6008909	6009929	My me did better without me.
6010209	6011430	Alright, Loki, you gotta close it up.
6011470	6014831	We gotta get into some rapid fire news is what we're about to get into.
6015691	6017152	I have no idea how to quit out, by the way.
6017252	6020753	I just hit home and then hit B to quit.
6020793	6022174	Like, there's no, like, quit option.
6023454	6025195	It's like, you're stuck playing four races.
6027015	6027916	Fantastic.
6029236	6031537	Great, great menu design, Nintendo.
6031737	6032497	Fucking amazing.
6032978	6033318	Alright.
6035168	6035688	Yeah, we'll see.
6036188	6037369	Because I got the fucking cart.
6037449	6038969	It does not corner for shit.
6039049	6039550	Yeah, that's right.
6039590	6040490	Blame the cart, Loki.
6040590	6041790	It is the fucking cart.
6041810	6042811	It's the computer's fault.
6043311	6044331	It's the internet's fault.
6044531	6045312	Hey, we'll see next week.
6045332	6045772	Bobby's fault.
6046192	6047072	Hey, we'll see next week.
6047112	6047693	No, two weeks.
6047793	6048533	We're off next week.

6164236	6169258	ExplodeMon, Oddworld Munch's Odyssey, Frozen Synapse, Serious Sam DD, New Star Soccer 5 GamesAid
6186584	6186984	Outro Music
6201365	6204246	and then there was a game called APB.
6204326	6209187	It was kind of like Saints Row Online or Grand Theft Auto Online if you will.
6209327	6223550	APB went freemium and now apparently they've been having some pretty good success over Steam and they're also going to release it as a box version that you can find in retailers.
6224190	6230212	For $29.99 you're going to get more than $50 worth of in-game items as well and
6232453	6233133	It's pretty awesome.
6233153	6243800	I guess the original game only had 130,000 registered players, but they've already picked up more than the original audience, so that's pretty fast.
6243820	6245861	That's pretty awesome, because a lot of people wrote that game off.
6246442	6249064	Yeah, they picked up 3 million new registered users.
6250084	6250244	Wow.
6250284	6251645	3 million after showing up on Steam.
6252126	6253987	And, you know, from what I played, very little of it.
6254967	6255468	It was pretty cool.
6256028	6259010	I mean, it's worth checking out because it's free, so why not?
6260063	6260363	All right.
6261284	6262165	Let's go to some other news.
6277617	6280498	Well, if you want to try VidRhythm, the good news is it's now free.
6280979	6282960	If you missed it the first time around, shit, go get it.
6283020	6288142	It's free now with 12 new tracks and a VidRhythm update 1.1 that happened this week.
6288402	6293585	There are some holiday songs, Deck the Halls, Jingle Bells, and apparently pitch correction now.
6294065	6295425	So now you can sound like T-Pain.
6295465	6296566	I don't know exactly how that works.
6296966	6298487	Six new video styles in there as well.
6298707	6301569	And, and, one more, you can export the clips in high definition now.
6301949	6303711	So VidRhythm had a pretty meaty update this week.
6304051	6309054	Very cool seeing Harmonix support it, even though it's more of a WTF kind of application, to be honest.
6309575	6310395	Holy shit.
6310575	6311416	What are you holy shitting?
6311456	6311896	VidRhythm?
6312176	6316479	No, a picture of me when I was 20 that one of my friends just posted.
6316639	6317400	Wow.
6317640	6318260	On Facebook?
6318361	6318981	On Facebook.
6319181	6319942	Look at my hair.
6321843	6322563	It was long.
6322583	6323464	Okay.
6324275	6325876	Sorry, I was just like, wow.
6326557	6328878	You used to have pretty big boobies back then.
6329959	6331460	I've always had an epic rack, Rob.
6331480	6332260	What are you talking about?
6332280	6336663	You know what's gonna suck is if I do get all knocked up.
6338356	6339316	They're just going to get bigger.
6339597	6340057	It's true.
6340157	6344539	You know, Zether might have the biggest Mario Kart e-peen, but you'll always have the biggest tits.
6345779	6346920	I do have an epic rack.
6347720	6348440	It's not a bad thing.
6348560	6348840	All right.
6349861	6352402	Alan Wake is coming to PCs in early 2012.
6353322	6363527	Even though the game's been on Xbox for quite some time, about a little over a year, year and a half, Alan Wake is supposed to be coming out on the PC finally in early 2012, which is interesting because...
6364907	6394008	I thought the game was originally supposed to be on both and then they said no it's not going to be on the PC well now it is actually coming on the PC both download content the writer and the signal they're going to be included in the PC version for free possibly to make up for a little bit of lost time interestingly enough this is time to be right around the time that the Alan Wake Xbox Live Arcade game or Alan Wake's American Nightmare is supposed to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade so kind of maybe trying to get the name out there a little bit again before the Xbox Live Arcade expansion
6395068	6401791	Connectimals is coming out on another platform.
6401951	6403831	It's coming out on iOS.
6404492	6407132	I think this is very interesting.
6408153	6410954	Maybe something we should talk about in a more extended segment.
6410974	6413855	But Connectimals is coming out on the iOS platforms.
6414375	6415456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6442112	6459719	also you know why I think this is interesting is because there's been a lot of calls for Nintendo to do something like this right the investors really want Nintendo to be doing this and they've really staunchly refused but Microsoft has now shown that they're not afraid to do it now granted they get a little more out of it with the whole Windows phone tie-in
6460299	6462282	But, I mean, they put it out there.
6462322	6467068	It's kind of like they acknowledged, hey, if we don't put it out on iOS 2, we're selling ourselves short a little bit.
6467749	6469991	They kind of gave Windows Phone an exclusive window.
6470152	6473976	They put it out there first, but they kind of gave in and did the iOS system.
6474036	6474257	I just...
6475856	6479678	It's not like Microsoft and Apple doing things together is completely unheard of, right?
6479738	6484520	Remember the gasps heard around the world when Microsoft Word was announced for the Macs?
6485080	6487441	That was years and years ago when Steve Jobs first came back to Apple.
6488101	6490062	But it's still interesting, nonetheless.
6490182	6491383	Very interesting to see this happening.
6491903	6495184	Be curious to see if Sony or Nintendo ever does anything in a similar vein.
6496205	6497465	Anyhow, moving on, DarkSakra.
6498626	6500347	Wow, I found pictures of me when I was four.
6501107	6501387	Okay.
6502127	6502288	Aww.
6502408	6503668	I was a cute kid, damn it.
6504008	6504609	I'm still cute.
6504769	6505309	What happened?
6506201	6507061	Sonic CD on Xbox Live
6533507	6534047	XBOXLIVEARCADE.COM
6556463	6565590	Also, there will be the deal of the week, including Japan's Finest, which is Hardcore Uprising and Radiant Silvergun for $7.50 each.
6566190	6573315	Bangai OHD Missile Fury and Gunwage are $5 a piece, and Rock of Ages is down to $5 as well.
6573535	6576577	But everyone needs to get Sonic CD and Radiant Silvergun.
6577298	6578078	Yay sales!
6578959	6585624	I love the Japanese soundtrack for Sonic CD so much, but then again, it's just not the same without Sonic Boom.
6587589	6589110	And, oh yeah, there was other new shit.
6589791	6593614	Sorry, I was all, you know, excited over Sonic.
6593654	6594475	Sales and stuff.
6595716	6600180	There's a new Pokemon game that's a crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition.
6600340	6600620	What?!
6602622	6602882	Yeah.
6604223	6604764	It's true.
6604924	6608167	When I think about Pokemon, I think about Nobunaga's Ambition.
6609045	6613988	So do I. I always wondered, wouldn't these two games go great together?
6615569	6618351	Make the Pikachus go out and get the rice to feed the troops?
6618831	6619631	And a trailer.
6620312	6624695	And it's set for 2012 release on the Nintendo DS in Japan.
6625935	6636302	and I am going to post a link to this on our Tumblr Meanwhile the rest of the internet's like where's our new real Pokemon game?
6636362	6641025	I want Pokemon Fuchsia or whatever Meanwhile the rest of the universe shits their collective pants
6643887	6644868	That's it, that's it.
6665247	6672998	You know, I was going to mention, remember earlier I said that I don't like people sending me invites, or I'm not going to accept any invites that people send me for the SimSocial?
6673698	6681990	When the fuck does AOL Instant Messenger start posting on your fucking Facebook wall saying, I've been idle since blah blah blah time?
6682310	6685832	I don't fucking care if you haven't been doing something in another app.
6685912	6687733	So hide all that shit.
6702862	6704943	I want to make sure that shit's not happening.
6706243	6707803	You don't realize it's happening, you know what I mean?
6707843	6708544	You got to be careful.
6709004	6711665	Go through every now and then and check what apps have access.
6711865	6712745	Honestly, that's what you got to do.
6713105	6713285	Yeah.
6713525	6713745	All right.
6714745	6718386	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about Club Nintendo.
6718406	6723968	And this is kind of cool because actually I've never really registered stuff on Club Nintendo and I started yesterday.
6724088	6728929	So I had a bunch of these old games I just went back through, like Excitebots and shit like that.
6729249	6731310	So I just added almost everything.
6731590	6731910	DarkSakura.com
6760706	6770190	Virtual Console, WiiWare, and eShop Games, including this first round of games, either 100 or 150 coins.
6770831	6775753	For 100 coins on the Wii, you can get Super Mario Kart on Virtual Console.
6775973	6781576	This is only good until January 10th, so if you want to use that, then go ahead and do that if you don't have the game.
6783116	6787598	For the WiiWare, you have Fluosity, and that's 150 coins.
6789339	6805663	On the 3DS, or DS, I believe it's the 3DS, you have the 3D Classic Xevious for 100 coins, or Mario vs. Donkey Kong Minis March Again for 150 coins.
6807404	6811205	And it's neat, but yeah, there's not really...
6813075	6814596	I was kind of disappointed at the rewards.
6831187	6831867	Thanks for watching!
6853573	6857915	I'm kind of disappointed though that you can't and here's the other thing I don't like about the registering the games.
6857935	6862117	Yeah, it's cool that we registered the games but I don't like fucking filling out that survey.
6862357	6871242	Yeah, it's kind of like especially, did you notice how you get a damn survey for each and every stinking NES game and probably now the Game Boy Advance games are all going to have a survey on there too?
6871262	6874664	I kind of think it's a good thing to have some surveys.
6874824	6877725	They want to make sure that they're still releasing stuff of good quality.
6877865	6880166	So do you get coins for buying stuff on the eShop?
6881267	6882848	Yeah, if you do the survey on them I think you do.
6883297	6884358	I didn't have any surveys.
6884538	6886440	Well, I haven't purchased anything on the eShop either.
6886460	6887561	Yeah, check it out once you do.
6887741	6889382	I think they do get some stuff there.
6890003	6892625	Cool, they got surveys for the free shit.
6892925	6894947	By the way, the information is up on our Tumblr now.
6895508	6900252	The link to the Pokemon Plus Nobunaga's Ambition.
6900292	6902133	I love that Jigglypuff's on the cover.
6902373	6904055	She's going to sing the armies to sleep.
6904255	6913141	What is looking like to me, from what I can tell, is that every human character has a Pokemon partner.
6913161	6914722	I guess they're doing Digimon.
6915122	6926750	This one guy in purple armor has Mewtwo, and the girl, she's all in pink, she has Jigglypuff, and this one's got... So you see, and then I think whoever he is is the guy catching them.
6926970	6929912	I'd be more interested in the Dynasty Warriors Mario crossover.
6929932	6930813	Yeah.
6931813	6932373	Shut up Shut up
6961465	6965028	Well, you'll lose a lot more than 20 minutes if you hit this bug here.
6965468	6966128	Did you hear about this?
6966168	6968150	There's that Zelda Skyward Sword.
6968190	6978117	Apparently, you could catch yourself in some type of error where if you complete a quest in the wrong order and then talk to a guy, you can screw things up.
6978177	6978497	I don't know.
6979038	6987184	But apparently, Nintendo on the support page for Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword says you can actually send in your save file to be fixed.
6987424	6987504	What?
6988705	6995209	A Nintendo apparently will also be putting out a program that will repair the saved data if you have your Wii connected to the internet.
6995610	6997691	So it's like a patch, but not really.
6998352	7000453	So yeah, I guess you could catch yourself in some type of loop.
7000473	7001274	Because they can't patch.
7001594	7002355	Yeah, they can't patch.
7002695	7004336	But they're going to put out some type of fix.
7005037	7006157	So there you go.
7006778	7012542	You could send in your Wii and get your game fixed if you screwed up.
7014221	7019202	So, just, I would read the internet and figure out what you need to do to not screw it up.
7019982	7024063	Or don't try to break the game, because I think you kind of have to go backwards a little bit to make this happen.
7024823	7025303	So, I don't know.
7026403	7026683	All right.
7027263	7029584	We're going to now see if anybody can break our mailbag.
7031584	7036005	Mailbag at orangelauntradio.com is the place to send us emails every week.
7037525	7038905	DarkSakura, read some emails.
7039485	7039985	We have two.
7040425	7040826	Two?
7041326	7041606	Yeah, two.
7041646	7043386	That's a pathetic showing of emails.
7046158	7071753	I got my answer from the Consumer Protection They said they can't give legal advice even though they are under an Attorney General's office Then again, I didn't ask for legal advice, simply information Their answer seems to say that this is not codified in law in Maryland My advice for these nasty EULAs is if you feel the need to sue Microsoft or Sony is to first try the arbitration then dispute it if the settlement is unfair
7072543	7074344	I think you just got a form letter back, dude.
7074585	7075385	That sucks.
7077086	7078187	Okay, last email.
7080229	7080489	Sorry.
7081550	7082490	Hey, OLR crew.
7083251	7086773	So I hate to be the guy that sends you yet another silly YouTube link.
7087094	7088335	Okay, Rob, get ready to pull it up.
7089055	7091257	But I found this to be worthy of a quick watch.
7091717	7099182	Maybe my sense of humor is completely sick and perverse, but I'll be damned if the kids in Skyrim aren't annoying little bastards every now and then.
7100203	7101564	This just proves... Every now and then?
7101844	7102484	Every time.
7102524	7104585	Is this another goddamn arrow to the knee clip?
7104825	7105265	I don't know.
7105665	7106906	This just proves I'm not alone.
7106946	7108686	I think Loki in particular will get a kick out of this.
7108746	7110127	Okay, I'm linking it to Rob.
7110187	7111247	Hold on, I got it, I got it.
7111307	7113268	Is it from... Okay, I see it.
7113328	7113648	Here we go.
7114008	7116269	It's probably the Killing Children mod or something.
7116409	7116869	Alright, here we go.
7116889	7119630	It's called... Yep, Killable Children is what it's called.
7119710	7120511	So let's see here.
7121211	7122511	Ew, it's playing an ad.
7122532	7125132	I don't want to watch no ad with ugly people.
7125813	7126333	Alright, hold on.
7129532	7130312	Ad, ad, ad.
7131433	7133153	Well, grandma was a hottie dot com.
7134273	7135553	Yes, that's what the ad was for.
7136013	7137594	Now you know the type of stuff I watch on YouTube.
7138054	7138834	Okay, here's the real clip.
7138854	7140874	You shouldn't talk to strangers, little kid.
7140974	7144735	Gutted with a fire sword.
7144895	7147675	Oh, look, I just... I just killed a little friend here.
7147715	7148335	Look at this shit.
7161039	7162140	Why are they hurting each other?
7163021	7163502	Oh, shit!
7164003	7165725	I'll have your head!
7165745	7166827	I have your head, bitch!
7167708	7169570	Oh my god, that's terrible!
7169690	7170472	That's awesome.
7170932	7172134	I've seen this video before.
7172214	7173396	Are you trying to run away from me?
7174337	7176400	I didn't even know you could decapitate people.
7178584	7179925	Agnet, you rush the dragon.
7180665	7181165	I stay here.
7181185	7183686	I kind of want to go back and play Skyrim again and just kill everybody.
7183786	7184827	Be careful, Agnet.
7186287	7187328	I kick hands on the ground.
7188368	7189209	Wow.
7189269	7189729	Yes.
7190149	7190429	Sorry.
7190509	7196231	In all seriousness, though, I'm a huge fan of the show and have been listening for over six years.
7196311	7202494	I listen on and off throughout the week while working and you three managed to put a smile on my face no matter what the topic is.
7203034	7206456	Even if we talk about child killing, unicorn stabbing.
7207316	7215846	Decapitating their mothers Face melting I wanted to ask you how you have kept the show going on for so many years Alcohol
7218514	7222655	I have known countless groups, bands, organizations, etc.
7223115	7226176	that start off strong but lose steam and eventually die due to apathy.
7226756	7233398	How do you guys manage to push through and deliver week after week after week after a whopping nine years?
7233798	7239620	What keeps you motivated and do you guys ever have major disagreements or even fights regarding direction?
7239700	7240220	No, never.
7240420	7242601	You want to see the show go in the future.
7243021	7246142	Just want to see behind the scenes gossip for a rabid OLR fanboy.
7246562	7249024	Take care and happy holidays, Tonic Vision.
7250926	7252848	First of all, I'm never the same person every day.
7255830	7260975	It's because of my innate woman-ness that I will change personality all the time.
7261255	7263096	You never know which Pokemon she's carrying around.
7264297	7265377	Rob and I go to Disneyland.
7265417	7266778	That helps.
7266798	7272859	I honestly don't know how we've managed to do this for nine years.
7273819	7279581	It's funny you're asking this now because we had a pretty good scare this past week that it might end very suddenly.
7279661	7283462	There was a realistic possibility for a minute there that this could have been the last OLR.
7283482	7285162	I was still going to try the Skype thing.
7285362	7287223	No, it wouldn't have been the last OLR.
7287303	7295025	I know, I know, I know, but the last OLR as we know it, you know, and I have my issues with the Skype thing.
7295145	7298146	I know Horde House kind of does it, but, you know, just this show.
7298226	7299686	It's good enough for Horde House.
7300306	7304508	This show has worked because we haven't changed a lot since the first day.
7304828	7305828	Are you shitting me?
7306048	7307309	We've changed quite a bit.
7308829	7311010	But we've had nine fucking years to change.
7311030	7311970	But we've evolved.
7312390	7317152	Yes, we've evolved into Raichu at some point along the way.
7317192	7318833	I thought we were Jolion.
7318933	7326216	We slowly evolved into the whole general video gaming when we used to be about DDR.
7327297	7329898	The show had absolutely no fucking structure back in the day.
7329958	7332599	I had a migraine the first episode and was asleep in that chair.
7336421	7351707	If you listen to the first few episodes, we really would just be like, we're just going to kind of like fuck off for three hours and talk about topics because, you know, as much as I hate inflating Travis's ego on this show, that's kind of how I learned to do it on Understation Live is we kind of like had that same approach.
7351727	7355828	It was like, well, we know we're going to talk about XYZ tonight and somehow we'll do a show.
7355988	7358229	And it were I'm not knocking Travis at all.
7358289	7359249	He does a beautiful show.
7359289	7360530	And that's Iron Fingering.
7360570	7363331	Yeah, that's that's how I was raised, so to speak.
7363371	7364131	But at some point.
7364711	7368873	along the way when we made the switch into podcasting.
7368953	7383440	I think suddenly when we took a different approach in making the to-go edition and then suddenly it was like, okay, we've gone from having 50 people listen live to having 2,500 people downloading our podcast.
7383480	7386261	It was like, shit, something's working over here.
7386361	7388762	Maybe we should try mixing it up a little bit.
7388882	7390243	And it's kind of worked.
7390303	7390383	It's
7390643	7409525	and having the structure hasn't been such a bad thing but yes there's structure but there's still huge amounts of spontaneity and a lot of that is directed by you guys in the chat room and I hate to sound mushy yucky frilly fuzzy but the chatters to a big extent and our live audience and the interaction that we do get on the show is
7411827	7413649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7435786	7437488	It was during the garage years.
7437548	7440090	I remember that.
7440210	7445835	And it was probably around that same time when Remember the Computer went down mid-show and I had the big diva fit.
7445875	7448498	I think not long after that I was ready to just fucking quit.
7449439	7455424	And within a short time of each other, we had the listeners chip together to buy a new computer.
7456445	7461830	And I got not one but like two emails that were very kind of personal in nature about like,
7462611	7479248	You know, just what I've kind of put out there on the internet being like kind of open about the fact that I'm gay and you know in a relationship and all that stuff and that it kind of gave some people that were struggling with coming out like hope and that like means like so much like I was just like floored and I was kind of like I fucking can't leave.
7480770	7482352	I'm in this too deep now.
7482573	7487459	They keep bribing us with food and games and happy things.
7488040	7490604	Inevitably, it'll have to end someday.
7490724	7491705	Nothing good lasts forever.
7493788	7495090	What else am I going to do on Sunday nights?
7496136	7496677	DarkSakura.com
7517492	7518833	Hey, we don't have the show tonight.
7518853	7519934	Let's go get Pinkberry.
7521175	7522376	And then we talk about the show.
7522637	7525800	Literally, the last time we didn't have a show, that's exactly what happened.
7525820	7527642	Was that the night the internet kept us from doing a show?
7527662	7530645	Yeah, so I was like... And we went to breakfast that day.
7531305	7532967	Because Dan was watching stupid football.
7533688	7534208	So we're like...
7535239	7536320	Let's go get Pinkberry later.
7558478	7563202	Yeah, which by the way, you need to work on that, girly, as soon as you get past all the other stuff.
7563482	7564303	One thing at a time.
7564503	7575851	I know, I know, but seriously, I need to talk to you offline about something because I don't want to say anything on air, but you need to work on that because people are making travel plans because I kind of let it slip to somebody.
7575931	7580054	Like, there might be something happening at such and such place at such and such time.
7580354	7580635	Really?
7580675	7581855	I'm booking my ticket right now.
7582376	7582736	Shit!
7583417	7584517	Now it has to happen.
7584537	7584617	Yeah.
7585879	7588042	because I can't let this person down.
7588422	7594390	Yeah, well, it's going to be a busy couple of months because also a mutual friend of ours is graduating in May.
7595973	7597294	All right, so go to their graduation.
7597354	7598456	Say, have fun in the real world.
7598496	7598796	Bye.
7598817	7601220	And then get back on planning the 10-year party.
7602228	7602668	Uh-oh.
7603369	7603549	Yeah.
7603689	7604830	Alright, I guess that's kind of a big deal.
7604890	7605370	That's a big deal.
7605470	7605771	Alright.
7606531	7617859	So, um, but you know, I also think that part of it too is that just with how crazy, like, I know I lost my job, but you guys know how miserable I was before.
7617879	7618500	Mm-hmm.
7619080	7624444	You know, having this show gave me something to mark my weeks because...
7626804	7631026	I really was just like, what am I doing?
7631686	7632986	Oh yeah, I have this show.
7633587	7641430	And it really kept my level of consciousness of what was going on around me up instead of just falling into, I'm depressed.
7644411	7649873	A lot of stuff that's, like for instance, I got to go to E3 like five times.
7650673	7652274	It's coming up later in the show.
7652354	7657858	I don't know if I'll ever get to go again, but because of this show and some of the contacts I made and friends I made, I got to do that.
7657978	7660560	At least I can say I've been, even if I never get to go again.
7660580	7662101	You've got friends all over the world now?
7662161	7663762	Yeah, for real.
7664342	7665683	We can actually say our friends.
7666084	7668165	Oh yeah, absolutely.
7669826	7671927	Which I do miss the New York crew, I will say that.
7672228	7675610	Not that I should be partial to one or the other, but I really do miss that group in New York.
7676170	7679893	I want to go hang out with Rob in England.
7680873	7681853	Heck yeah.
7681953	7682514	And Syl.
7682614	7683094	Oh my god.
7683134	7684914	I want to hang out with Syl so much.
7684934	7685474	So bad.
7685494	7686534	And then I want to raid with her.
7686574	7687395	We would party.
7687835	7690975	She's been doing her live streaming of the Star Wars.
7691055	7691576	It's kind of fun.
7692036	7692776	I love Syl.
7692876	7695396	But I want to go on a pub crawl with Rob.
7696817	7699697	I think we need to make a plan to go international at some point.
7700197	7702858	But anyway, I don't want to drag all this self love out.
7702878	7705399	And then we're going to go to Japan and sleep in Ikuma's closet.
7707479	7708160	I'm kidding.
7708220	7709900	My friend Krista lives in Kyoto.
7709940	7710621	I'll stay with her.
7712202	7715463	But seriously, you guys in chat are being so sweet right now.
7715664	7716464	She lives in Osaka.
7716524	7716904	Never mind.
7717324	7718585	Let me read some of these comments here.
7718665	7720486	DJ Dark Knight says, we love you guys.
7721387	7724068	Misty says, yes, sure me, no matter how much you want to deny it.
7724428	7726109	Bochikawa says, we love you guys.
7726729	7727650	Black Wolf agrees.
7727710	7728330	That's my thing.
7728350	7729511	My Sunday nights will be empty.
7729631	7731372	I've never not done a show if I'm not home.
7731432	7733093	The only times I cancel is if I'm not home.
7734174	7739559	DJ Dark Knight says, I have always considered you guys my second family and know I can turn to you guys when I need a pep talk.
7739899	7749709	See, it's stuff like that where it's like, how could it just, how could we just say, you know what, I don't feel like doing a show tonight.
7750236	7751538	and we've had those nights.
7751638	7752099	Trust me.
7752499	7752920	We've had those.
7752940	7754622	I don't fucking want to do a show tonight.
7754742	7754943	Fuck.
7754963	7762713	How about every time a new Harry Potter book would come out and all I would do is fucking read Harry Potter during the show and go oh girl did you just see that?
7762874	7764296	Oh you didn't because I'm reading it not you.
7764796	7765577	But then it's like
7766478	7767339	Anyway, I don't know.
7768199	7769640	I don't want to talk too long on this subject.
7769660	7771422	It's kind of like kissing our own butts.
7771582	7774244	I do have to, though, thank all the listeners for something.
7775464	7778266	You guys have been with me through some shit.
7779527	7781268	I got married doing this show.
7782589	7784350	I graduated college doing this show.
7785350	7787131	I've moved a few times.
7787191	7789352	I've gotten promotions while I've done this show.
7789992	7791913	I got laid off while doing this show.
7792113	7795234	I mean, big major events in my life.
7795275	7797616	Loki went through a lot too on the show.
7797916	7801377	And I moved a few times.
7801577	7804018	I've had the same fucking job for 10 years.
7804679	7806239	Well, you're Mr. Stability.
7806259	7808000	Well, but I can't complain.
7808280	7810281	I'm very happy with where I'm at in my day job.
7810828	7812509	And Shermie has pooped live on air.
7833795	7835516	It would have never... But he's such a sweet person.
7835576	7839238	It would have never come to that without this show.
7839298	7842259	He's so nice, and I was more than happy to do the work.
7842960	7848723	Which, by the way, guys, you'll get to see what it looks like as soon as we finish the move, because I'll be updating my portfolio.
7849083	7849283	Nice.
7851604	7852304	Umlaut was great.
7852965	7854905	I'm sorry I missed it the other years.
7855025	7856826	Last year I had a final exam that day.
7858086	7862908	This year my teacher let me get out of my group project and do it early.
7863088	7864088	That was cool.
7864128	7865549	He was like, that's a big event.
7865589	7866069	You go to that.
7866109	7866889	That's a big thing to you.
7867929	7873051	Also, one thing I have to say that I've learned a lot of skills doing the show.
7875208	7876448	You're a bitch, so fuck you.
7901536	7901997	You know what?
7902117	7909560	I was upset for like five seconds and then I just realized these people don't know me and the same skill works very well in real life.
7911021	7912461	We gotta move on with the show.
7912821	7914422	Loki, you've been strangely quiet.
7914442	7914982	You okay?
7915563	7917884	He's sobbing at his corner.
7918124	7921826	I was... I can get you an E3.
7924467	7924867	What?
7925247	7926208	I do love you, Loki.
7926228	7926588	What?
7927368	7928409	I said, I can get you an E3.
7928429	7928649	Okay.
7929915	7930676	Get me too.
7931236	7932557	This is what I love about Loki.
7932898	7935099	We'll be sitting here talking and reminiscing.
7935420	7936801	Loki's already hacking something.
7939303	7939523	On it.
7941785	7942746	I'm right on top of that, Rose.
7943166	7943446	All right.
7944307	7944587	Wow.
7944667	7945848	And if you know what movie that came from.
7945868	7947930	If you didn't just show the show's age right there.
7948751	7949692	No, I saw that in the theater.
7950192	7950552	Me too.
7950853	7951453	Can we move on?
7951513	7952294	We got a show to do.
7952314	7952394	Yeah.
7953803	7955304	I'm going to satisfy the listeners.
7956625	7961428	By the way, Loki, you're going to regret saying that on air because I bet you you're five seconds away from a private message from Bobby.
7963870	7964250	Anyhow.
7965611	7965952	Okay.
7966212	7967373	All right, let's move on.
7969054	7970155	The FUs of the week.
7970435	7971916	Oh, how appropriate.
7972036	7979021	After a fuzzy wuzzy cuddle hug fest, rainbows and sunshine, now it's time to bring in the rain.
7979041	7979961	Here's some rainbows.
7980062	7981122	Blow them out your ass.
7981583	7983124	Here comes fucking reality.
7998915	8001697	F you to jury duty when I gotta move.
8001938	8006501	I would rather move furniture than go to jury duty, but at least I have a good book to read.
8007062	8009203	I'm reading The Land of the Painted Caves.
8009243	8010124	You also have free Wi-Fi.
8011725	8012366	I brought a good book.
8012406	8016249	I'm bringing a good book that doesn't require Wi-Fi.
8016689	8020192	If you do happen to get stuck there, Wednesdays, you gotta go up to the farmer's market.
8020212	8021934	They have fucking awesome pizza there.
8022414	8022734	Okay.
8022914	8023715	It's delicious.
8023855	8025196	It was worth pizza.
8025316	8027058	I'm just gonna tell them it's Hanukkah.
8029094	8031095	I don't think it's going to work.
8031135	8031475	Damn it.
8031815	8036337	They'll be like, okay, or the judge will be Jewish and be like, well, it's not like it's Rosh Hashanah.
8036617	8038218	The judge will be like, Mazel Tov, bitch.
8040359	8042180	Loki.
8042220	8047822	PuggyDemarkCard7 for not allowing me to change my cart in between matches because that kind of sucks that you can't adjust that.
8048102	8052424	Or, for some reason, having a clear way to quit online.
8052904	8053845	Thank you for watching!
8073965	8075446	Oh well.
8076767	8077747	My FU of the week.
8078788	8080049	Oh God, where do I begin?
8081069	8082670	You know the old saying, when it rains, it pours.
8082870	8086693	And especially this time of year, it's just kind of a... It's a bad time of year.
8087233	8089594	But I'm really looking forward to having vacation coming up.
8089614	8090855	Because damn it, I earned it.
8092716	8093857	And I'm going to go to Disneyland.
8094317	8095358	And you need to help me move.
8095558	8095858	Deal.
8095938	8096218	What?
8097999	8098299	What?
8098660	8100301	Help me set up the studio.
8100321	8101141	Alright, that I can do.
8101421	8102442	If you'll let me set up video.
8104633	8130622	If it's not pointed at me Alright, you're on The listeners have been demanding live video We need to make their wishes come true So we'll work on it Alright, fine, I will help you tech out the new studio Alright, let's go back into some gaming news So we can get some calls here in a minute Loki I like that Darth Spazinator says If Loki can go one show without hacking something or ranting Someone should check to see if he has a fever or something
8132159	8133900	Yeah, I'm in hack mode all the time.
8134780	8135220	All the time.
8135960	8137541	He's hacking your life as we speak.
8139101	8139501	You mad?
8140201	8144963	Okay, so Capcom is releasing a Capcom digital collection.
8145003	8150684	It includes a bunch of Xbox Live Arcade games, basically.
8151044	8151945	It's coming out for $40.
8152945	8156306	And it includes 1942 Joint Strike, Commando Rearmed 2...
8157746	8176031	Final Fight Double Impact Flock, Rocketman Axis of Evil, and also with the DLC, it came from Uranus, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, and Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3.
8177631	8179792	All those available for $40.
8179852	8179972	Now...
8184133	8197298	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that one of those games, at the very least, I believe Final Fight Double Impact, required you to be connected to Xbox Live in order to play it registered.
8197318	8200419	I think that was PlayStation Network.
8200439	8201239	That was PlayStation Network.
8201259	8201819	They didn't have that on.
8201859	8202140	I think.
8203340	8204040	It's been a while.
8204080	8205861	Maybe this is where chat can help us out, maybe.
8206641	8211864	I can't remember, but I thought that would be interesting if it required you to play online.
8212024	8213004	That would be interesting.
8213044	8214005	Well, maybe they changed that.
8214825	8215065	Maybe.
8215385	8217707	But anyways, it's about $100 worth of games for $40.
8218327	8221889	So, good deal, I guess, if you don't already have them.
8222429	8224670	So I have at least a few of those.
8226345	8227866	E3 passes have doubled in cost!
8243218	8247841	And I know what you might be thinking, you might be like, wait a minute, you don't pay to go to E3, doesn't everybody go to E3 for free?
8247901	8249702	Like you register and you prove you're in the industry?
8250203	8269636	Well, yes, for the most part, most everybody you see at E3 got in there for free, because either they are tied into the industry, they are in the media as a lot of the people, obviously, they are in kind of like the, not just the gaming, the people that make the games, but the people that purchase the games, like Loki's industry, distributors, and all those people, retail, a lot of the folks that go.
8270256	8270716	DarkSakura.com
8286002	8314191	Expo Passes so to believe it or not this whole time you could really pay to go to E3 you could just say I'm exploring the industry or I'm a student wanting to kind of get into this or whatever and you can pay and the prices used to be let's see it was $400 was last year's price if you registered before a certain date and $500 if you registered at the door for three days you know it's expensive or you could say I'm Sinbad or
8314751	8316052	Or you could say you're Sinbad.
8316512	8317853	I got nothing to do today.
8318013	8322095	However, the news is this year those prices have shot way up.
8322195	8323195	They've doubled.
8323976	8325977	Now, it doesn't sound like they've doubled, but they've doubled.
8326877	8328778	Multiply them by two and then subtract five.
8328798	8331319	$795 before the deadline for a three-day pass.
8331439	8331319	$995.
8331519	8334941	You might as well say $1,000 for a pass to get into E3 after April 23rd.
8341644	8345786	So, I mean, that kind of sucks for people who want to explore.
8345826	8349788	Like, I'm not, I'm trying to figure out why E3 is doing this.
8349868	8359193	My thought is they're trying to maybe cut back on the people because there's some, you know, blogs and things have joked about this is that, well, you're paying all this money to wait in line.
8359693	8361294	And I have to agree.
8361354	8365296	Like, I didn't, well, we didn't, we didn't go to E3 last year.
8366076	8367137	Remember that, DarkSakura?
8367477	8368338	We went to E3.
8368398	8369298	We went into the lobby.
8369618	8370379	Yeah, we hung out.
8370799	8372200	We got freebies from the lobby.
8372280	8374742	People were kind of looking at us like, where's their badges?
8374782	8377223	But we didn't go into E3 itself.
8377263	8379504	But we were in the convention center kind of between the two halls.
8379925	8381646	And I held a DS street pass with people.
8381726	8383887	So we're just kind of like hanging out between.
8384648	8386589	And honestly, I don't feel like I missed much.
8387169	8388630	I mean, yeah, there were some big announcements.
8388650	8389751	Didn't you get a Wiamoto?
8391050	8392431	No, I didn't get Miyamoto.
8392471	8393992	I think Shane did.
8395053	8396693	So he got the Miyamoto.
8396734	8397234	Somebody did.
8397454	8398655	Maybe Bobby did.
8399015	8399475	But yeah.
8400956	8403658	I don't think it's worth that much money to go stand around and wait in line.
8403858	8404638	I mean, it would...
8408319	8411041	It would suck if you've gone all these years and then suddenly you can't go anymore.
8411282	8416146	I know Bobby's probably doing a lot of like, how am I going to get an E3 this time?
8416166	8421391	Because unfortunately, the media standards, they do this weird measurement where they're measuring your website traffic.
8421431	8427856	Well, if you're a show like us, they're looking for so many hundred visits a month, which we would hit easy on subscriptions.
8427976	8431880	We would easily hit, I'm sorry, they're looking for like thousand, but we would still hit that.
8432060	8432321	RSS feed
8449625	8478026	I don't know if it will work or not we'll see unfortunately the website fuck ups last month might damage that and I don't know but I don't know it's whatever arbitrary scale they want to use and I get what they're trying to do like it was so easy for somebody to just start their own website and get 20 of their friends in E3 under that website I feel like they did have to draw the line somewhere but I think they drew it too far out that us indie people kind of get fucked you know anyway
8480819	8481059	Vita!
8499824	8501125	We've got Vitamins.
8502926	8503807	No, actually not really.
8504607	8506429	What is going on with the Vita?
8506489	8508690	They are actually getting rid of the instruction booklet.
8508730	8509130	Guess what?
8509251	8510772	Apple did it first.
8510812	8512993	Neener, neener.
8513013	8519017	They're actually having digital manuals that you can access in-game for each of the games.
8519778	8524321	So it puts people like me out of a job that like printing.
8524341	8528444	Can you design online stuff?
8530857	8533498	Yeah, I could still do PDFs and everything.
8533518	8534378	I mean, that's not a big deal.
8534458	8538840	But they're basically going to be doing in-game manuals.
8539460	8540980	It's still kind of yucky, though.
8541000	8541881	I mean, I don't know.
8542001	8545862	I'm torn because it's like, how many times do I really read the instruction manual?
8545902	8551844	Well, it makes sense because they're already creating them anyways because they're offering all their games digitally as well as at retail.
8551904	8555605	So if they're already creating those digital things, why make them printed?
8555625	8555705	Yeah.
8555985	8562888	But then I think about back in the NES days, like the manual to The Legend of Zelda that kind of like told the story in the first few pages and so forth.
8562908	8563509	See, that was awesome.
8563529	8564589	I miss that kind of shit.
8564649	8565670	But I get it.
8565750	8568631	Like now, I don't really bother reading manuals.
8568691	8569812	I mean, look at Skyrim.
8569832	8573654	Skyrim came out with a fold-out map that's made to look like parchment and shit.
8574314	8575895	I mean, they still do that kind of stuff.
8576035	8579837	Like, I remember like my copy of Grandia that had a cloth map.
8580257	8580457	Mm-hmm.
8581300	8581960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
8603945	8604505	That's true.
8604585	8606366	It just had a how to hook it up.
8606606	8607887	All in their bookstore now.
8607927	8609567	You can get a full manual in the bookstore.
8610248	8610908	But you don't need it.
8611728	8613569	There's a video of a three-year-old using one.
8614709	8615590	Sending text messages.
8616630	8620632	But I'm just saying, you know, it's not a new thing.
8621132	8624233	Cloud Cleveland in our chatroom says, gotta save those trees.
8624633	8625234	You know what?
8625394	8628575	For every tree that's cut down in the United States, three more are planted.
8629201	8632683	I have a feeling it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek, that comment.
8633204	8636026	I know, but it's not an excuse.
8637727	8639648	It's a cost-saving measure is what it is.
8640248	8640769	It's what it is.
8641229	8641729	Let's be real.
8641769	8642710	It's a cost-saving measure.
8643090	8648594	It costs money to print those books, and they decided they could save money on getting the game out there by just getting rid of the books and putting them online.
8648614	8648954	That's true.
8648994	8658200	I mean, I understand and I agree, but, I mean, it's putting a whole... It's the end of an industry of printing.
8658621	8659001	It's sad.
8659361	8659561	Yeah.
8660122	8666228	But, well, if you think about it, though, Jamie, I hate to say it, but a lot of printing industry is going digital.
8666388	8668410	I mean, look at... I love the smell of ink.
8669091	8676298	I know, but... And I think there will still always be demand for things like movie posters, advertising still big and all that.
8676338	8681302	But, like, look at things like, you know, the New York Times is on the frickin' iPad now.
8681423	8682163	And that's how people...
8683084	8683444	Get it.
8683825	8684305	But you know what?
8684385	8688887	I think the whole thing about the print industry in and of itself is it's turning more into a specialty market.
8689428	8703416	Because there are now, there's a resurgence of quality magazines, if you know what I mean, that are like artsy magazines that are like nice, thick paper and done in a certain size.
8703576	8707378	Those, and they charge quite a bit for them, but they know their market.
8707398	8710120	They're the people who are printophiles and...
8712042	8713943	Look at the stuff you had to do for Umlaut.
8713963	8716144	There's a lot of design shit that people don't even think about.
8716364	8717165	Somebody made the badges.
8717205	8718325	Somebody made the photo background.
8718345	8720426	Somebody made the flyers.
8720906	8721847	There's a lot of stuff.
8721967	8723147	I did the digital ones too.
8723167	8727670	There's also people who need to design game covers.
8732146	8734387	Do you need to do the layout on the back?
8734728	8735748	That's not going to go away.
8735968	8741532	That's why I get really irritated when people buy a nice expensive box set and then they just throw the boxes away.
8742592	8744253	Do you realize that someone put work into that?
8744574	8747895	Think of some of the great covers we've had in gaming like the original Mega Man cover.
8750937	8751878	Here's an example for you.
8752278	8755320	Remember Rolling Stone used to do the top 100 album covers of all time?
8756621	8757701	Do we have that anymore?
8757841	8758662	Do they still do this?
8760103	8761264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8780784	8781886	DarkSakura.com
8797603	8801966	Yeah, it's cool to have it digital because then you can have it in color.
8802466	8808930	You don't have to pay for a four-color process, which is expensive.
8810090	8813072	But at the same time, I think it's really sad.
8814493	8818775	It does take something out of an entire industry.
8819856	8820136	All right.
8821292	8823253	I would be the only one in this house that would go off on that.
8824313	8825674	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
8825694	8826774	And yes, I like the smell of ink.
8826834	8827154	Shut up.
8827294	8832956	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
8833096	8833877	But first, Loki.
8834477	8834657	Yes.
8835597	8842900	So let's talk a little bit about my favorite discussion topic, Skylanders.
8844620	8848222	And I've said it before, you know,
8849799	8851480	You guys are only encouraging them.
8872052	8890656	it's basically a world where you can go purchase a piece of the virtual skyland and customize it however you want along with a skylander character and i guess it's uh filled a bunch of different little mini games and stuff like that and they're gonna have constant updates to go along with it as well um
8892438	8901266	No word on integration though with the actual characters, although I would imagine that they're going to have something like that.
8904249	8908472	I see a button that says rental, so obviously they're charging for something.
8909153	8914478	But, I mean, seriously guys, I hear so many people going, wow, you know...
8916069	8916930	Thanks for watching!
8940533	8954224	Marvel vs. Capcom 3, when they were charging $6 per character for DLC, people bitched like crazy, saying, what the fuck, you expect me to pay $6 for a fucking character that was on disc?
8954884	8960508	Hey, you're paying $8 for a character that's on disc with Skylanders, and guess what?
8960829	8963350	You keep buying them, so they're going to keep releasing them.
8964892	8965212	So...
8966969	8968431	I have you guys to thank for that.
8968691	8971374	Thank you people that got all fucking nostalgic about it.
8971574	8972255	Because guess what?
8972555	8976260	When next Call of Duty comes out, you're going to be fucking paying $8 for whatever.
8976780	8977201	A gun.
8977221	8978983	You're going to get a little plastic gun.
8981906	8983408	I sense you're really upset about something.
8984426	8985066	It's just annoying.
8985687	8987288	People complain about the prices.
8987748	8989229	Why are they charging so much?
8989269	8992251	Why is there so much DLC for these games?
8992611	8996493	Why am I not getting only half a game and have to buy the rest in DLC?
8996813	9003137	It's because you're willing to pay $8 for a fucking plastic figurine that does nothing to play as a character in a game.
9003377	9006859	And not only will you buy one, but you'll buy tons of them.
9007059	9007699	Outro Outro Outro
9032455	9034477	I love Salacious Pop's comment in chat room.
9034857	9042605	If it didn't cost like $380 to do it, it would be awesome to hold an OLR drive to surprise Loki's tyke with a full Skylanders rig for Christmas.
9046509	9048591	What a cruel thing to do to Loki.
9049071	9050072	He wouldn't care.
9050773	9052735	He plays with spoons and boxes.
9052755	9053836	He tried to eat the toys.
9055638	9055978	Alright.
9058773	9060574	One more story for you guys here.
9061455	9063396	And it's about an online... Oh, you were done, right?
9063436	9063677	Sorry.
9063877	9064237	Yeah.
9064257	9064497	Okay.
9064917	9066018	One more story for you guys here.
9066038	9067079	I was trying to get to Skyblind.
9067619	9069481	And it's about Need for Speed World.
9069701	9070841	Do you know Need for Speed World?
9071022	9071502	Do you remember this?
9071542	9075425	This is the Need for Speed online free MMO that they have, right?
9075545	9075805	Yes.
9075945	9076625	Dan was playing it.
9076765	9076986	Yes.
9077846	9078327	It's all right.
9078527	9082770	But there is now in this free game a special...
9084071	9088833	and Koniseg, Konikiniseg CCX Elite Edition car.
9089413	9093434	And it's kind of like, you know, you can buy it because usually like freemium games have things you can buy in them, right?
9093995	9095975	Well, guess how much this car will set you back?
9097196	9095975	$5.
9097216	9097596	$100.
9097236	9097596	What?
9098276	9104939	Oh, tons of people will buy it because, oh man, I've always wanted like a race car.
9105359	9109160	I'm going to get a race car for my online game because I will pay $100 for DLC.
9109200	9109520	Give me more.
9113613	9115315	It's all for profit, right?
9115475	9116515	Yeah, of course.
9116696	9118417	I'm looking at the actual press release here.
9118477	9125222	It says that there's the first premium elite car available to all Need for Speed World players via the in-game store for $100.
9127164	9128425	By the way, oh, get this, get this.
9129665	9134069	For a limited time until December 21st, you can get the super car for $75.
9134149	9135570	It's a 25% discount.
9136931	9138592	Well, shit, I'm jumping on that right now.
9139793	9140374	It's elite.
9140394	9140514	Elite.
9142250	9157291	This is like, you know, this is an interesting This is gonna make me burp This is an interesting trend in MMOs lately And god damn, I hope WoW doesn't go down this path Although I would say the $25 mounts are kind of pushing it And I have yet to buy a $25 mount $10 celestial steed right now I never Fuck that steed I know
9157691	9158691	But here's the thing.
9160172	9161052	Other MMOs have been doing this.
9161232	9162872	I remember Bobby was talking on his show.
9163252	9166313	He's dabbled in EVE Online, I think, or he knows people that are playing it.
9166913	9172014	And they had the whole Monocle thing that was being sold for like $60.
9172795	9177856	But some people, in order to really stand out in a crowd and have the biggest EPing, will pay that money.
9177896	9178456	I mean, think about it.
9179176	9186742	Why was there so much internet rage about people getting into that Star Wars The Old Republic game different times this week?
9187362	9197749	People were pissed that they weren't first, that they couldn't have the first level 50 character, although let's be real, nobody that was complaining about it is going to be the one to have that first level 50 character.
9199030	9209038	the person that has the first level 50 character is probably a group of people that are pushing their way to it just to have the biggest peen you know what I mean?
9209799	9226612	people will do pay anything to get ahead and have the biggest peen and I'm sure that thing sold quite a few cars probably not a ton but enough to make EA probably do it again which is sad
9228103	9240233	Remember that app that when the iPhone first came about and they had an app that was like $5,000 or some shit for a sparkling diamond thing that spun around and that's all it did?
9240673	9241854	Yeah, people bought that shit too.
9242295	9242935	Because they're dumb.
9244957	9245978	And, and...
9246388	9249453	I'd like to point out once again how stupid Skylanders is.
9249553	9252157	Take a look at this picture of Spyro from Skylanders.
9252538	9258467	He looks like he got fucking kicked in the teeth and some teeth got knocked out and he's like raging now.
9258607	9259048	I don't know.
9259108	9261752	It's just really stupid looking.
9263819	9264800	Where did his teeth go?
9265081	9267764	I mean, seriously, he looks so derpy now.
9268705	9270026	It's derpy Spyro.
9270787	9271047	Love it.
9271127	9271608	Derp bro.
9272829	9273210	All right.
9273730	9275893	Anyhow, that's going to do it for stories.
9276293	9278275	Now we're going to open up the Skype line.
9278295	9279557	You can give us a call.
9279577	9284602	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9284642	9285243	Give us a call.
9285803	9287665	We will talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.
9287705	9291007	Maybe you have some news that we missed.
9291107	9294489	Maybe you've been playing that Star Wars game and want to tell us a little bit about it.
9294990	9297672	Or maybe you have some feedback on some of the things we talked about tonight.
9298092	9301634	While we're waiting for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters.
9302555	9308259	But I need to... God damn it, Tumblr is automatically posting to our Twitter again.
9308279	9309320	I thought I turned that shit off.
9311929	9312029	Oh.
9313130	9319716	I mean, not that I mind that people know that we have a Tumblr and everything, but it kind of sucks when they get like 50 updates during one show.
9319876	9320257	It's all right.
9320817	9321358	Did you see them?
9322419	9322839	Yeah, I saw.
9322879	9324200	I can see you over your shoulder right now, in fact.
9326342	9327423	All right, let's go to the Twitter topics.
9327443	9329505	It's twitter.com slash OLR while we wait for some calls.
9329525	9330946	And yes, we'll do some last minute stories too.
9331447	9333789	Oh, or we'll go straight to the phones because the phones are ringing.
9334209	9335410	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9335430	9335831	Who's this?
9336837	9345279	Hey, this is Bobby from Atlanta, and I was wondering if I could get a weather report from the last place in the race.
9347780	9350041	Bobby Backwolf calling in to troll Loki.
9350141	9350921	I love it.
9350961	9351701	Yeah, yeah.
9351981	9352681	Nice, nice.
9352721	9353622	That's all right, Bobby.
9353662	9354902	Enjoy your win right now.
9355842	9362624	I just remember last week, you're like, we can't play him before the show because then all he'll do is cry during his show after I beat him.
9364224	9365045	I do remember that.
9365065	9366848	That was funny.
9366888	9369232	We just wanted to let you feel good tonight.
9369372	9370173	Oh, thank you.
9370233	9370995	Yeah, you're welcome.
9371035	9372617	And then next week we're going to really bring it.
9374440	9375762	Yeah, I'll be here waiting.
9376283	9376844	Oh, yeah.
9377044	9378366	Shit, we're not going to be here next week.
9378426	9378767	Damn it.
9379898	9392353	I'll be at home I'll bust it out after the show Maybe I won't be at home I don't know how long the family stuff is going I may not be at home actually, so I can't promise that But if I am at home, I will be on after Bobby Lockwell Yeah, and you know what I'll do?
9392893	9397138	Take a nap Did you just call in to troll Loki tonight?
9398654	9401076	Yes, but I do have other things I can comment on.
9401116	9402157	Like the E3 thing.
9402397	9402897	Yeah, yeah.
9402957	9403758	Tell us about the E3 thing.
9403798	9406220	You've been to E3, how many freaking years in a row?
9406580	9408501	18 years in a row or something crazy?
9408521	9409162	15 years in a row.
9409182	9409782	15 years in a row.
9410302	9414645	And I paid $75 to get the exhibits only pass in 97, my first year.
9415366	9416166	Oh my gosh.
9416847	9419429	So $75 for the three-day expo pass.
9419689	9419869	Wow.
9422402	9430554	It always has gone up and like 400 was a big jump because I think the last time I had paid I was like it was still like 150 or so to 200.
9431476	9436343	But what I think is going on is that they're really trying to keep people like me out.
9437469	9445694	because about half of my E3s have been free either through the media or through software development credentials or whatever.
9446855	9451077	And the other half have been free, and I always had that to kind of fall back on.
9451457	9463845	I'm going to kind of equate it to something that's – I don't know if they've got these type of toll roads out in California, but they just opened one in Georgia where they increased the price to dissuade people from using that lane.
9464685	9465906	E3 is trying to do the same thing.
9465926	9473070	They're like, well, if these bloggers that we don't feel have a right to be here are willing to pay the 400, let's see if they're willing to pay the 800.
9487819	9511759	and there are there is probably people that will say no that's too much and uh you know if they're not a legitimate business they can't write it off as a business expense or anything like that so what they're trying to do is they're trying to limit the amount of people that they don't think should be at E3 from still getting into E3 because that's been the dirty little secret is as long as you're over 18 you could pay and it didn't matter what your job was
9512677	9514098	Wow.
9514498	9515979	It didn't matter what you did.
9516039	9518760	If you gave them the money, they gave you a pass and said, have fun.
9520501	9525984	It just kind of stinks that some of us who have been trying so hard for so long kind of get the shaft.
9526004	9531427	There's some people that do get those numbers that kind of look down on the rest of us and say, well, just try harder.
9531828	9539472	But it's kind of like, well, it's tougher when they don't get what we're doing and that I'm not here to create a website.
9539512	9539652	Right.
9541226	9542408	I don't know if that makes sense.
9557068	9586074	but the individual shows themselves don't exactly have the website visitors unless they've got a vibrant community that they've built up and unfortunately our situation is kind of unique with the chat room and the live streaming and then the podcast and stuff and there's just they don't want to deal with it they already feel they allow too many media and so they're not going to change anything they do so I'm not even going to bother with the media pass this year but see what they've done to me
9587054	9605782	is the way I got in last year was through my day job because I'm a software developer and yes we actually do work on IOS stuff and I have done gaming exploratory stuff with my day job so technically I'm a game developer and that's usually good enough well apparently they've kind of updated their industry rule
9606664	9612346	and now they actually check your company's website to see if you publicly have ties to the gaming industry.
9613946	9620188	And since we don't have any completed projects, our website just talks about the real estate websites, which is our main revenue.
9620968	9622329	It says nothing about the gaming.
9623089	9630411	I'm still going to try to apply and send my W-2 and the tax ID and all the stuff that I need that I was eligible with last year.
9630771	9634672	I'm going to send it in, but they may look at the website and say you're not in the gaming industry.
9635953	9636293	Wow.
9637671	9640012	It's like they're paying all these people to investigate who's going.
9640052	9644793	I mean, I kind of get that something's got to give because the show has a lot of people there.
9645694	9646514	Yes.
9646534	9648334	There are a lot of people that shouldn't be there.
9648495	9648715	Right.
9649395	9655797	But in order to keep them out, they also have to get some of the people that probably do have more acclaim.
9655817	9660739	Because a lot of the companies there do believe I should be there, but it's not up to them who gets invited to E3.
9660959	9661799	It was at one point.
9662762	9664228	Yes, and I got in those years.
9665051	9668744	Funny enough, my first E3 was thanks to Friends of Konami.
9669437	9669537	Yeah.
9670017	9675280	So it's... In fact, DarkSakura could say the same thing, I think, and for a couple years was kind of that way.
9675300	9676220	It got in through DDR.
9676300	9681702	Well, because we were all doing DDR-oriented stuff, and Konami was really pushing those games when they came out those years.
9681762	9683563	So they definitely wanted to see us there.
9683963	9689286	But it's... And we were there the year Beatmania launched in America, and obviously they knew that that would be a big thing.
9690726	9694088	We tried to get the word out, but unfortunately it just wasn't its time.
9694628	9694748	So...
9695468	9696609	So, I mean, and that's what it is.
9696669	9704972	And I'm not going to sit here and QQ over, you know, not getting in to go to E3 or something or it being a little bit too expensive or something, you know.
9705753	9709854	But it does, you know, from a personal level, it does kind of suck because I've gone every year.
9710215	9710695	Right, right.
9710895	9712075	It kind of sucks to lose that.
9712155	9715057	And there are people that I see there that I only see once a year.
9715797	9728886	and to me E3 is more about the people and not the games I actually talk to more people and network more than I actually play games unless it was 2007 when only 3,000 people were there and I actually played a lot more games what's going to happen to our Disney trip?
9730507	9738213	I don't know I'm sad remember we went to Disneyland with Bobby this year at E3 that's why we went to E3 we went to pick Bobby up
9739690	9741251	I wanted that to become a new tradition.
9741291	9744354	Maybe I'll just have to book a ticket out to Sacramento sometime.
9744414	9746636	We'll just go hang in the convention center.
9746656	9747777	We'll take you to Fairytale Town.
9748097	9752020	I need to actually clue you in on what's going on for the 10th anniversary or what we're trying to plan.
9752340	9753621	Because I just realized I haven't told you yet.
9753801	9755583	It would be awesome if you could make an appearance.
9755623	9756924	But if not, totally understand.
9757124	9759986	It's expensive.
9760147	9763870	Actually, the only expensive part would be a hotel room.
9763890	9765291	But if I didn't need one of those...
9766531	9768093	We can work something out.
9768714	9770557	It's gonna be somewhat local.
9771538	9775424	I really have to watch my mouth because nothing has been sealed yet.
9775484	9777326	But Jamie's gonna work on that real soon.
9778228	9780349	When she's done with what's worrying her now.
9780550	9781630	Yeah, see, I know, I know.
9782491	9783511	I'm on your side, Jamie.
9783812	9784232	In the New Year.
9784352	9784972	Thank you, Bobby.
9785113	9787154	All right, well then, Bobby, that means I need to hang up on you now.
9787694	9787874	All right.
9787914	9788195	All right.
9788895	9789395	Take care.
9789956	9790556	Take care, guys.
9790596	9792277	Loki, get some practice in.
9792297	9794018	All right.
9794058	9794919	Stop trolling.
9795259	9795799	Bye, Bobby.
9795859	9796360	He hung up.
9796560	9797541	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9797601	9801243	See, he gets one lucky race and then all of a sudden...
9801516	9804238	Yeah, see how fucking good you are without those fucking items.
9804519	9807401	Yeah, we'll see where the real racing is, but that's all right.
9807761	9822474	Bobby, for what it's worth, you guys, I know we plug him a lot, but if you're not listening to Bobby Blackwolf, he really works hard on his show, and it's a great show, and it's kind of like a... I always kind of call it like an NPR-style show, because it's just him talking about games, but, you know, you can hear his voice when he talks to us there.
9822494	9829740	He has a great radio voice, and, you know, he really kind of thinks about the topics he's going to talk about, and so he's kind of able to sustain the show himself, and...
9830040	9831441	Catastrophic Moggy Catastrophic Moggy
9854502	9855583	A long, long way away.
9855683	9856543	I'm in the UK.
9856903	9857584	Oh, my gosh.
9857644	9858304	Yay.
9858424	9860165	It is way past your bedtime, young man.
9860686	9861426	Talk about it.
9861446	9862487	It's five in the morning.
9862947	9864088	Oh, my God.
9864668	9867890	Well, thank you for staying up late listening to us.
9868070	9868670	Good heavens.
9869731	9871392	Well, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
9872092	9873113	There's a couple of things.
9873873	9879337	Your really big bundle is actually the Indie Royale, and they have the Xmas bundle up now.
9879717	9879897	Mm-hmm.
9880703	9887847	which includes the Blackworld Trilogy Remastered Eats, Dino D-Day, and the Oil Blue, just in case you're interested.
9887947	9895751	Also, going back a little bit about the peripheral for the 3DS, Nintendo have been doing this for years.
9895771	9896872	Remember the N64?
9897332	9903895	They had the memory expansion slots, which also you needed for Zelda.
9905236	9906277	Oh God, the horrible one.
9906377	9907377	Majora's Mask, yes.
9908178	9908478	Yeah, that.
9909622	9911714	So Nintendo have been doing this for a long time.
9912439	9912620	Mhm.
9913601	9914061	That's true.
9914081	9918125	Nintendo always just kind of put out these extra little things and then suddenly the game requires it later on.
9918145	9919566	That's very true.
9919786	9920667	Nothing new for Nintendo.
9920687	9925050	They did the same thing with the... What the hell was I talking about earlier?
9926171	9926371	Wii.
9926531	9927973	Wii with the Wii Motion Plus.
9928033	9929294	Did the GameCube do anything like that?
9929334	9930254	I don't think the GameCube did.
9930275	9932156	I think that's the one system that kind of stayed consistent.
9932576	9933017	I don't remember.
9934078	9939002	They had those WaveBirds were awesome, the wireless controllers, but that's all I can think of there.
9940142	9943045	It just seems every generation will try to do one thing.
9943853	9947257	They had the Game Boy Advance cable, but there were so few games that used that.
9947277	9948679	Didn't they have like a network thing?
9948699	9948979	Yeah.
9949519	9950741	Phantasy Star Online used it.
9950781	9951121	That's it.
9952302	9953123	Maybe one other game.
9953143	9953964	Mario Kart Land.
9954004	9956807	That was the warp pipe or whatever it was called.
9956827	9961152	That was a terrible, terrible thing Nintendo did, putting that out there and then just never using it.
9962967	9966388	You know, Katastroph and Moggy, since you're calling in from the UK, I've got to say it.
9966988	9973211	You must kind of laugh when we bitch about how we're having to wait all this time for Xenoblade to come out over here.
9973531	9977932	Because Nintendo's been fucking over you guys for years with their releases, huh?
9978673	9979973	That's one of the weirdest things.
9980033	9983074	Who'd have thought Nintendo would ever release a game here first?
9983154	9984655	Except, you know, maybe Tingle.
9985586	9986727	That Tingle RPG.
9986987	9989029	I don't think we ever did get that Tingle RPG, did we?
9989069	9989709	No, you didn't.
9989849	9990470	I don't think so.
9990710	9991290	That's sad.
9991330	9991911	It's tragic.
9992431	9994012	Loki had it pre-ordered and everything.
9994833	9995994	Oh yeah, totally.
9998756	10001598	Did he have his pre-order for his costume as well at the same time?
10002018	10002439	I wish.
10002619	10002919	I wish.
10002939	10005241	Yeah, and unfortunately they cancelled that too.
10005401	10006161	I'm sorry.
10006181	10006362	It sucks.
10006382	10006602	Shame.
10011193	10013676	Talking about that though, the funny thing is you're talking about manuals.
10015519	10024871	In the UK though, I mean you said Japan gets better manuals than you, but in the UK most of our manuals have always been black and white, even when you get nice colour manuals.
10026437	10028539	We just get cheap black and white ones.
10028579	10035024	You get the 7 cent copies from Kinko's whereas we're having to deal with the color ones.
10035104	10036245	That's great.
10036285	10038627	Man, you guys have been getting this shaft on your releases for years.
10038707	10039448	Why is that?
10040129	10043071	Why do you guys have to wait and then you don't even get the nice manuals?
10043632	10047795	The probable reason is because Europe has a lot of languages.
10050197	10050798	That's true.
10051318	10053480	We usually get really thick manuals with
10054407	10056808	10 different languages also in it.
10057528	10061469	A few pages for English, French, German, blah, blah, blah.
10061749	10062430	You know what's interesting?
10062510	10066251	Even here now, all the Nintendo games usually have their manuals in three languages.
10067031	10068892	English, French, and Spanish.
10069072	10076094	And I'm assuming that's because they do a lot of big North American region launches, so they have French for the Canadians and Spanish for the Mexicans.
10076614	10078195	But it's just interesting.
10078215	10078295	Yeah.
10078835	10079876	Just trying to save money.
10080697	10081798	I guess, I guess.
10082819	10083800	One last question though.
10084121	10090127	I remember a few years ago you were going to do a Euro, a Europe show and it got cancelled at the last second.
10090623	10094965	It did, and we ended up starting the marathon show we did a couple months later at noon.
10095785	10098766	Are you ever going to plan another Europe show?
10099167	10101608	Staying up this late is not good for my health.
10101768	10103548	I think we're going to have to.
10103568	10107190	At our friend's request, we're going to have to do another UK show.
10107390	10108651	We need to do another marathon show.
10108691	10110551	I'd be absolutely thrilled to.
10112212	10116774	We did mention a little bit about maybe we should do something earlier in the day on New Year's Eve.
10118366	10120547	May... Wait, no, we're not doing a show New Year's Eve.
10120587	10121188	It's New Year's Day.
10121368	10122649	New Year's Day at this moment.
10122669	10123689	No, so we want to do a show later.
10123749	10124069	Trust me.
10124289	10124570	Yeah.
10125150	10127331	Well, because I'll be hung... No, I don't get hungover.
10128512	10132494	But we were definitely... We had talked about it.
10132534	10135716	We definitely wouldn't mind trying something like that again if the schedules work out.
10135996	10141277	Yeah, I'd love to do another marathon show at some point and do more of like the live gaming and playing the games.
10141717	10144518	So sometime in 2012 for sure.
10144978	10145698	Early 2012.
10147898	10149059	Can I ask you a question?
10149779	10150119	Sure.
10150479	10155140	Because I want to be sure that I have this thing about placing accents.
10156200	10157340	So do you live in the north?
10158721	10159321	Oh, yes.
10159601	10160061	Yes, I do.
10160828	10161288	Awesome.
10162569	10164410	Well, it's either north or south.
10164891	10174657	Well, no, because I sort of place it not like way north, but more like in the mid-north-ish area.
10174957	10177059	Whereabouts in the UK are you?
10177879	10178299	Yorkshire.
10178780	10179040	Okay.
10179060	10181802	Which is sort of in the middle, almost.
10182501	10184183	Look at you, accent guesser.
10184623	10186945	I watch a lot of BBC, thank you.
10187225	10188466	All right.
10188506	10196394	Well, when we come out to Europe and do our international show, you're going to need to come drinking with Syl and Rob and Picaruno, I have to add to that list.
10196614	10201338	That is if you can get me to not try to run off to Cardiff to see if I can be an extra on Doctor Who.
10201358	10201838	Oh, stop.
10203720	10203960	All right.
10204221	10205161	Certainly.
10205181	10206483	We'll have to tie you down.
10206503	10206903	All right.
10208052	10209234	No, my TARDIS!
10210635	10212077	Take me to the future!
10212678	10214841	And it dematerializes before your eyes.
10215121	10215462	All right.
10215782	10217885	Castarvamagi, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10217925	10219107	But thanks for staying up late.
10219287	10219788	Good heavens.
10220389	10220689	Thanks.
10220809	10221150	Bye.
10221190	10221750	Have a good one, buddy.
10221830	10222091	Bye.
10223192	10224934	I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight.
10224954	10225554	I'm so sorry, guys.
10225574	10226575	I am proud of myself.
10226655	10229578	But we're after midnight on the East Coast.
10229658	10232201	I haven't done Twitters either, and we've got to do last-minute stories.
10232501	10234583	So I'm going to quickly, quickly run through tweets.
10235184	10236605	So we're going to go do tweets here.
10237466	10238967	Oh, God, where am I going to start off here?
10240809	10242190	Okay.
10245373	10245714	Let me see.
10245734	10248176	I've got to screen this story first because they don't say anything on this.
10249744	10259952	Okay, we got a tweet from Cloud Cleveland that links us to a story on ScrewAttack.com that talks about Game Gadget System wants to be iPod Gaming.
10260092	10260953	Oh, this is kind of neat.
10260973	10266017	It looks like somebody's changed a typical iPod to put a little...
10266797	10267038	GameGadget 1.0
10295717	10296317	Thanks for watching!
10315723	10320665	set the appropriate pricing and gain incremental revenue, but with no additional investment.
10321146	10321846	Oh, okay, so I get it.
10321866	10323287	So it's not actually like an iPod.
10323327	10328409	It just kind of looks like one with its plug-ins and stuff, and they're just trying to build like an app store for games.
10331690	10337953	It would be interesting to see if they get the buy-in, because I don't know if they're going to actually get the buy-in on that.
10339214	10339334	Okay.
10341420	10350788	Alright, I need to reopen the Skype line because I just realized there is one more call I promised we would take tonight and I totally slipped my mind amongst everyone else.
10350808	10352069	It's Rob's mom!
10354030	10354210	No.
10354230	10355812	No, it's an important call.
10356312	10358494	Oh, I can't go, hi Rob's mom, you're on the show.
10358674	10359134	No.
10362017	10363398	Ah, wait, I'm not back on Skype yet.
10363418	10367681	Okay.
10367701	10368182	Okay.
10373021	10374782	Let's see how bad the ferret is today.
10376783	10377323	Not that bad.
10379684	10380244	Actually, you know what?
10380284	10380525	Fuck it.
10380545	10381165	I'll just call him.
10382045	10382426	Oh, there it is.
10382466	10382726	Never mind.
10382746	10383126	It's coming in.
10383806	10384126	Hi!
10386109	10387069	Hey, sorry Ranma.
10388189	10390890	As soon as you sent me the IM, I was like, shit, that's right.
10390930	10393390	I said he could call in tonight because he has something very important to talk about.
10393430	10401772	But amongst all the crazy stuff going on, our goodbye to the studio and all the other stuff, I just slipped my mind.
10401852	10402332	I'm sorry.
10403292	10412634	Bro, it's okay because in regards to what I want to talk about, when you were talking earlier about how you guys talk about everything besides video games and how...
10413663	10415364	were there for you like a big family.
10415684	10419405	It kind of hit home like a good thing, so I was cool with that.
10419785	10420025	Okay.
10420305	10420585	All right.
10421286	10421746	Well, thank you.
10422066	10429049	Now, you actually kind of called in tonight to not really talk about games or something gaming-related, but something just flat-out important to you.
10429869	10439952	Yeah, because I bring this up because we're independent podcasters, but we're also friends, and we always try to look out for each other one way or another.
10440553	10440833	So...
10441866	10456555	About a month, month and a half ago, one of my cosplaying friends, she goes by the name of Callie Rogers, she was hit by a car in LA and she was in a coma for about a month or so.
10459236	10467261	As to my information now, she's back home in DC and she's going through some rehab and from what I'm hearing is she's getting a lot better.
10468458	10478701	A couple of friends of mine, oddly enough both named Jesse, decided to help do something about it because with the rehab and all this, and it comes with medical bills.
10479362	10484123	So we're having a fundraiser and a donation drive.
10484623	10493226	So if you go over to AnimeJamSession.com, there is a button on the right-hand side of the page called Donate to CaliCat.
10493746	10496727	The first link is to Jesse's Auctions.
10497147	10507232	So if you are into anime and cool stuff like that, there's a lot of anime paraphernalia up there that's signed and autographed by producers and directors and voice actors.
10507252	10509072	That's awesome that you got their buy-in into that.
10509112	10509593	That's great.
10509953	10510133	Yeah.
10513735	10518443	The other friend, Jessie, she has a donation link set up as the second link.
10518483	10523933	So if you don't want to bid, but if you want to just give straight cash, you just click right on that and it goes right through.
10524244	10524944	That's awesome.
10524984	10530045	Well, I am sorry to hear about the situation, but most importantly, I'm glad she's getting better.
10530266	10531686	I mean, that's the most important thing.
10532806	10544069	So am I, because I haven't spoken to her in a while, because how it is, you're close-knit for a while, people kind of go separate ways, but when something happens, everybody comes back together to look out for each other.
10544369	10545049	Yeah, exactly.
10545650	10545990	Exactly.
10547450	10549291	So give us the way to donate one more time.
10549551	10555273	Because it's not just like you can go straight up and donate cash and I am going to see what we can do on behalf of OLR in that regards.
10555773	10559815	But you can also kind of get, you can bid on these auctions and get things too.
10559875	10561616	So one more time, how can we help?
10561856	10563497	Why does that t-shirt have to be so expensive?
10563637	10563897	Damn it.
10564577	10565657	Are you looking at the stuff right now?
10567578	10569859	Yeah, Mythbusters t-shirt.
10569959	10571660	I know, everybody's going after that.
10572120	10574001	Especially in light of the recent cannonball.
10574342	10575522	I'm not talking about what you do in a pool.
10576042	10578143	Alright, so one more time.
10579084	10588629	Just head on over to AnimeJamSession.com The button is on the upper right hand side of the page and that's going to be there for as long as I'm running that site.
10589369	10597093	And if you really can't donate or bid on one of the auction items I just ask that you click on that link which will take you to a blog page
10597293	10600577	where you can just copy paste the information and put it on your site.
10600897	10604981	So try to get it out there so more people can see what's going on and help the best that we can.
10605742	10606042	All right.
10606323	10608405	Help somebody you need, especially this time of year.
10609066	10610227	Oh, definitely.
10610307	10610707	Good luck.
10610808	10616734	And we are all thinking of your friend and hope she makes a full recovery very soon, but very glad to hear she's on the way.
10617453	10618454	That makes two of us.
10618734	10622336	Alright, well Ranma, take care and sorry again that I cut it off before you could get through.
10622356	10623577	Hey, it's cool.
10623597	10624138	No problem.
10624198	10625519	It's past your bedtime.
10625559	10628321	It's past everybody's bedtime and I haven't even finished Twitter topics.
10628581	10632483	I'm waiting for you guys to finish so I can go have Hot Pockets and eat and watch TV.
10632543	10632984	We're trying.
10633024	10633624	Last show of the year.
10633724	10634365	We gotta make it big.
10634845	10635365	Hell yeah!
10635445	10636026	Alright, bye.
10638283	10639843	Alright, now I am closing Skype.
10640544	10644224	AnimeJamSession.com Check out the podcast while you're there if you're in anime.
10644605	10650566	I know he wants to be humble considering the situation, not really promote the podcast, but he can promote both.
10651066	10653127	Alright, quickly, let's try to close out some of these tweets.
10654347	10657328	I gotta say, a couple tweets about the Xbox Live call earlier.
10658368	10659748	People in the same situation.
10660188	10661329	This one from SSJ100Matt.
10662549	10667591	This story on OLR just now scared me into changing my Xbox Live account's password to email address to it.
10667631	10668931	Change yours or you might get screwed.
10670132	10671152	I say it, but good advice.
10671352	10672592	At least you know you're going to be better off.
10673693	10676934	Also from SSJ100 Matt, here's an Ask Orange Lounge Radio question.
10677334	10678114	Which is better?
10679015	10682076	Waffles, pancakes, or French toast?
10682636	10683096	Rank them.
10684838	10688161	It depends on where they're from, but I will take my favorites of all.
10688401	10688641	Okay.
10689422	10692204	Number one is the French Toast at Sam's Kosher Style Deli.
10693025	10693525	You've had it.
10693986	10694266	I have.
10694346	10694806	It's epic.
10695707	10702172	Number two are the Banana Cream Waffles at Charlie's that's across the street from my neighborhood.
10703033	10711480	And number three, I guess IHOP Pumpkin Pancakes.
10712461	10712761	Loki's?
10713444	10714805	Pancakes would definitely be dead last.
10714825	10720568	That's a toss-up between waffles and French toast, because it depends where you go.
10720908	10724210	Actually, in its own category, it should be Waffle House.
10724930	10725910	Waffles, just saying.
10726591	10730113	For me, waffles are way up here, number one.
10730193	10731953	Waffle, waffle, waffle, way up high.
10732434	10735495	And then below that, pancakes and French toast.
10735535	10736616	I gotta rate French toast last.
10736636	10736956	I'm sorry.
10737536	10738097	Don't get me wrong.
10738737	10740838	It's still good, and I'll never pass on it.
10741358	10742579	Unless I'm not feeling well, but...
10743154	10743737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10746820	10751821	They need to have some sort of unholy turducken of like pancakes, waffles, and french toast.
10753021	10757423	You know, where you like take french toast and like... Like the Monte Cristo of breakfast food?
10757943	10764284	Yeah, you like take french toast and you maybe like put some waffle batter around it or something.
10764304	10771506	We begin with french toast made of challah and we stuff it with a crispy waffle filled with pancake.
10771906	10773706	I love Salacious Pop's comment in chat.
10773986	10775887	What the fuck is this Sophie's Choice shit?
10778388	10778848	Agree.
10779869	10781070	Think how it feels for us.
10782832	10784113	Sterlok says this is a tweet.
10784193	10785654	Vita shuts out the blind.
10786175	10791479	You can't use the buttons in the menus, therefore making the system completely unusable for us.
10792300	10792660	Really?
10792700	10793461	I'm trying to think now.
10793481	10796123	See, I haven't seen the Vita or look at the interface at all.
10796723	10799426	So I know he's talking about it looks like bubbles blind.
10800447	10808360	Is it because since you can't use the tangible buttons and obviously a blind person can't see the touch screen or know where to touch, that's why they're screwed?
10808681	10809823	Because you can't use the tangible buttons.
10810243	10810884	Well, that's messed up.
10812006	10813349	Sony needs to think about everybody.
10814932	10816012	Hopefully in a patch.
10816612	10819913	I mean, I have seen handicap accessibility happen in patching.
10820613	10825195	Not that that's going to be a great answer for right now because that doesn't look good for the U.S.
10825275	10825575	launch.
10825655	10827435	But, hey, you know what we say, buddy.
10827815	10828715	Vote with your wallet.
10829236	10830736	If you can't play it, don't buy one.
10831056	10833017	Alan is telling all about you.
10833597	10834737	Ooh, what?
10836275	10838397	Oh, that I eat waffles with nothing on them.
10838437	10839858	Yeah, I like plain.
10840238	10840919	I was like, tell me.
10840999	10841880	I do the same thing.
10841920	10843601	I burn them to a crisp and then I eat them.
10843621	10844422	Fuck yeah, burn.
10844442	10845363	Oh, so good.
10845383	10850947	But you know what I've been doing lately, though, is just screw any sort of utensils.
10851127	10853089	You just pour a stack of four waffles.
10853249	10855351	You pour syrup on the top, a ton of syrup on the top.
10855371	10856091	I don't even like syrup.
10856532	10857092	Oh, I love syrup.
10857673	10858553	I hate syrup.
10858593	10859474	And Jemima's stuff, man.
10859574	10860855	It's fucking good.
10861055	10861996	It's not that I don't like it.
10862036	10862337	Peanut butter.
10862357	10863037	It's just too much.
10863097	10863457	Like, why...
10864298	10866120	Peanut butter waffles are fucking good.
10866180	10875231	I do like all that stuff, don't get me wrong, but it's just, you know, especially after I got sick a few years ago, I feel like I can have the taste of it without adding all that stuff.
10875271	10878234	But I'll tell you what, there's one thing that is perfect by itself.
10879055	10882980	Waffle House chocolate chip waffles, extra crispy.
10884753	10886374	They are like eating a giant cookie.
10887294	10891735	Alright, I gotta get to a couple fast, fast tweets from Tigerclaw, because these are some big stories we missed.
10892215	10895397	Skyrim Online mod adds co-op.
10895757	10896777	This seems huge to me.
10897157	10899178	Yeah, but it's not even close to being done.
10899358	10903179	Well, yeah, it's still in an early alpha state, but it makes you wonder, why doesn't Bethesda do something official?
10903239	10908441	Maybe they will in an expansion for the game, I don't know, but it's called Skyrim Online.
10909081	10911682	The release notes are at SkyrimNexus.com
10912362	10913844	Right now there's no animations.
10913925	10920373	You just kind of see people floating around as their naked prisoner.
10920874	10921615	But they're working on it.
10921889	10922630	Yeah, they're working on it.
10922670	10924692	Right now they have chat and they've got, you know.
10925112	10925332	Right.
10925492	10925853	Some of that.
10926033	10926293	All right.
10927094	10928034	And let's see.
10928155	10929496	I got another tweet from Tiger Claw.
10929576	10932979	Namco Bandai trademarked Alien Confidential.
10933499	10934700	What the hell is this game about?
10935081	10935361	Yeah.
10935821	10936142	Who knows?
10936242	10936622	Who knows?
10936662	10939525	Seven aliens are forced to live in a house.
10940526	10943708	It was trademarked files on December 12th in North America and Europe.
10944669	10948192	I'm assuming this is an E3 reveal and probably not a...
10949974	10954918	Probably not a... I don't know where I was going with that.
10954938	10955719	I was making a bad joke.
10957160	10957740	It's getting late.
10957780	10958821	My brain's malfunctioning.
10959582	10959862	Help.
10964086	10965047	That's it for tweets tonight.
10967148	10967789	Last minute stories.
10968752	10970893	Atlas is teasing something on their Twitter.
10972494	10974855	They're giving hints to a new game announcement.
10975395	10981878	The first hint was it starts with G, the second hint was that it ends with an R, and that it's a strategy RPG.
10981938	10987080	People are thinking that it's Gun... was it Gunner?
10987200	10990481	They confirmed it's Gunjiner, or whatever that one is.
10990521	10991121	Yeah, Gunjiner.
10991742	10992422	That's the one it is.
10993695	10995096	Yes, of course it's what it is.
10995476	10996737	They haven't confirmed it yet.
10996757	10998117	They haven't made the official announcement yet.
10998278	10999938	Wednesday is when they're making the official announcement.
11000919	11001019	Oh.
11002020	11002280	Oops.
11004421	11005802	Well, I mean, everybody knows what it is.
11005822	11008103	It's like, come on.
11008123	11010244	I thought I read that from Dark Tetsuya, not you.
11011325	11019569	Well, I mean, they're saying, I mean, they're teasing that's what it is and everybody, they haven't come out flat, come out and said it yet because they will on Wednesday.
11019909	11021430	But yeah, that's what it is.
11023334	11024755	Atlas is publishing it, of course.
11026656	11027336	Looks interesting.
11027836	11029317	It will be for the DS.
11030077	11030898	Or PSP, I'm sorry.
11031058	11033779	PSP.
11033859	11038041	Telltale's doing a new series, Law & Order Legacies, for the iPhone.
11038182	11039982	It's coming out on PC and Mac next year.
11040943	11044925	It's kind of cool because I've watched a hell of a lot of Law & Order.
11047393	11049915	Very familiar with Olivia Benson from SVU.
11050575	11051335	And actually all the other ones.
11052076	11052876	I dig all the series.
11054097	11054897	So they'll be coming out.
11056719	11060161	And that's pretty much it.
11061461	11062062	Eh, I'll do it.
11062182	11062602	It's good enough.
11063106	11063426	All right.
11063967	11066069	Well, we've gone very late tonight.
11066169	11067510	It's been a long, epic show.
11068030	11070492	Thank you guys so much for staying up late with us and listening to us.
11071353	11073835	It's the part of the show where we've got to close up and get everybody's final thoughts.
11074496	11075276	Loki, we'll start with you.
11075376	11076337	Final thought of the year.
11076778	11079440	We never really did like an end of the year special where we picked our game of the year.
11079460	11082683	I guess we'll have to do that our first week back because we will have a show on New Year's Day anyway.
11082783	11083503	I have one already.
11083804	11084924	Well, let's wait.
11085065	11085965	Hold off on it until New Year's.
11086326	11086566	All right.
11086606	11087547	So your final thought, Loki.
11088487	11114704	my final thought is I need to work on my modding stuff because I have like 4 or 5 mod things in progress I have a screen here where I started doing code for Call of Duty Mario Warfare Stupid Skyrim keeps taking me away from it and now Mario Kart and then Grand Theft Auto modding holy crap haven't done that in forever
11116707	11118028	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11118928	11119889	Fucking jury duty.
11121650	11128214	My final thought tonight is there's nothing wrong with drinking the soda without a straw.
11128334	11130855	Good lord, Alan, leave me alone.
11131996	11134517	It sometimes tastes better when you don't drink it with a straw.
11134557	11135158	Thank you!
11135298	11136999	See, Loki, this is why we get along.
11137819	11137959	See?
11137979	11138439	Amen, Dan!
11138559	11139039	You rock!
11153782	11156646	The jokes write themselves.
11157627	11157827	Yep.
11158268	11162032	And on that note... Bye, kids!
11162192	11164114	That's the note we're going to go out on here on 2011.
