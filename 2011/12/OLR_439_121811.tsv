0	20080	Tonight, December 18th, 2011, Square Enix experiences a hack, Nintendo offers free games
20080	29920	for loyalty points, and the PlayStation Vita appears to abandon the instruction manual.
29920	34860	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34860	41960	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with the 439th episode
41960	50080	of our show on this December the 18th of 2011. We're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
50080	54520	where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right
54520	58200	after the Bobby Blackall show. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the
58200	62940	next few hours to talk about video games, gamer culture, gamer lifestyle, and so forth
62940	69920	with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. You're like that video of Rick
69920	75920	Perry where they replaced him with a butt. That one was great. How are you? I'm okay.
75920	84160	Yeah? It's been a long day. It's been a long day. Been packing up stuff. Mm-hmm. Been...
84160	89640	big changes coming. Preparing to abandon ship. Yeah, there's some big changes coming. We're
89640	93760	saying goodbye tonight, so we'll come back to that in a minute. Yeah. So let's also go
93760	98640	to the one and only Techmaster, Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? Fine. I see you brought
98640	103240	your 3DS tonight. Yes, I did. And I brought my 3DS. You know what that means? Mario Kart
103240	108200	Break Time! Hell yes! So live listeners, get your 3DSs because we're going to try and do
108200	113160	at least one track, if not two, of Mario Kart during the break tonight, so be ready for
113160	118440	it. The official OLRME 3DS code. It's on Twitter. It's on our forums too over at orangelawnsradio.com,
118440	122680	and I'm sure it will be pasted in chat momentarily. Tiger Claw will have it pasted there in three
122680	127640	seconds. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to join our chat room, of course, and
127640	133440	talk with us there. All right. In fact, Jim Salley is in our chat room tonight starting
133440	138440	us off talking about the intro to the show, saying, Jim Salley, OLR's intro is great.
138440	143120	It always pumps me up. It is a great little song. That was by Midihead. If you don't know
143120	147600	who did our intro, his name is Midihead. He did some of the songs in DDR, Beatmania, kind
147600	152280	of like around when the Xbox version, original Xbox versions were big. He's a great guy.
152280	156240	We had him on the show. And then Jim Salley says, then Rob's soothing voice brings me
156240	161680	down and I get all snuggly in bed. Not sure how to take that, but all right, sure. Whatever
161680	168480	floats your boat. Whatever gets you to listen live with us. Anyhow, so usually we start
168480	171880	off the show with how is your gaming week, so I think we'll get into that and then we'll
171880	174280	come back to the housekeeping thing we want to talk about. So let's talk about our gaming
174280	181040	weeks. DarkSakura, how was your gaming week? I played shit. I really haven't done a whole
181040	186040	bunch of console stuff just because we've been packing up stuff. More coming later.
186040	192820	We do have the GameCube out so that we could play the Game Boy Advance player. So we had
192820	202360	some run-throughs of the Final Fight that's on there and I played some P.O.P.O. and I
202360	206720	think Dan played some Metroid Fusion. But I mean we were just bopping through a few
206720	209720	games here and there. It's like Game Boy Advance made a comeback this week between that and
209720	215600	the 3DS news, which I know is coming up later, but everybody knows those games came out.
215600	222960	So we actually put the Saturn up because we're tired of Christmas nights. Oh well. Christmas
222960	231320	is cancelled. Da da da, da da da, I don't care to play this anymore. No other holiday
231320	235960	games to get you in the mood? Um, no. You don't want to dance to Silent Hill in D.R.?
235960	241760	Wow. Wow? Winter Veil? I've been doing stupid Winter Veil shit. No, finally, thank you Shane
241760	247240	for making me an orc DK so I can throw snowflakes at you. I don't even know if he's listening.
247240	253120	If you're listening. If you're not. There's Rick Perry again. He made a drawn-eye priest
253120	260560	for me to throw snowflakes at named poor Jamie. I think when I, and just so people know, like
260560	264280	what this is, there's certain achievements in WoW where you have to find characters of
264280	268800	a certain, like around the holidays, like for instance the Easter one or whatever they
268800	274440	call Easter in WoW, I can't remember. Noble Garden. Noble Garden, that's it. You have
274440	281780	to find female characters of each race level eighteen or over and it's called Shake Your
281780	285560	Bunny Maker. And you have to turn them into bunnies. And they have to be level eighteen
285560	289400	or older. I can tell you this because I'm a female dwarf which is like a freaking unicorn
289400	293920	in WoW and I can't tell you how much I get turned into a freaking bunny when that holiday
293920	300720	comes around. Freaking goats are easy to find. So I made a rogue for whatever the last holiday
300720	303920	was. You had to do something with a blood elf rogue. I don't remember why I did it,
303920	309360	but I did. And I named it Oops I Pooped. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that one. You made it for
309360	313200	me to find. Cause I still haven't deleted it. I thought you had a troll. I did, but
313200	316280	I deleted the troll so I could make the rogue. No, that's right. Cause I had to go, I had
316280	323280	to go run to you. Yeah. Stupid silver moon. Um, but yeah, so I've actually been playing
323280	327960	Peggle in WoW too now that it works again. Nice. But right now the thing that I'm trying
327960	334640	to get is I have to kill ten more people while dressed as a gnome in a, uh, Santa costume.
334640	338720	Oh yeah. I don't like how it kind of forces you to do PVP if you want to get all the achievements.
338720	343440	I know. And then like you get killed and you don't and you lose the disguise. All I have
343440	348960	to say when that stupid kids holiday comes up, you are going to want to kill, kill something.
348960	355000	I mean it's just, I actually, I want to do BB King. That's, that's not too bad. BB King
355000	360440	is where you go to, to the major hoard cities and you have to shoot the leaders with a BB
360440	365880	gun. Like, like I'm going to go shoot Sylvanus in the ass or something. Anyway, I saved the
365880	371920	WoW talk for the other show. Hoardhouse.com. Well have me back on. We might. Episode 50
371920	376000	is coming up very soon. When? I just have to convince Extrofer we should tape more often
376000	380080	than every other week. But that's another, that's another story. Well, um, I also got
380080	384880	some games on steam cause I got the humble indie bundle thanks to Rob and I started cave
384880	389080	story and then Dan's like, I was like, I'm kind of tired of playing cause we've had a
389080	394400	busy day. Dance like, Oh, play more. So he's watching me play cave story. That doesn't
394400	398980	usually happen. Usually you're watching him play stuff. So he's like, he gave, okay, check
398980	405980	out this elder thing. Rob. Nice. My old school game pad controller. You should put a picture
405980	410320	of that on olr.com. I might. It's actually not the one. It's not the one that I used
410320	414800	when I played. What brand is that? Is that like a gravis gravis? It's not the one that
414800	420360	I used when I played a final fantasy 11 in my, the older one that kind of to me looks
420360	424680	like what the PlayStation three controller was going to look like. Like it kind of has
424680	430200	that boomerang thing going on a little bit, just a little bit, but it's not quite as tacky
430200	434480	as that other controller was. It's actually fairly comfortable. I mean, cause you know,
434480	439640	my hands all fucked up. Yeah. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm kind of high. The pro you
439640	448640	are, I had had half a beer and I've been allergies all day. So cause all the dust we've kicked
448640	454880	up. So yeah. Um, I played cave story and then I got another game just randomly. I happened
454880	460280	to see it up on steam and I was like, that was kind of pretty. I'm going to get it cause
460280	466200	it's pretty. It was a game called fractal that you have to, um, you have these little
466200	475080	hexagon shapes on and for those who don't know their roots, hexagons are six sided polyhedrons.
475080	481920	What's a polyhedron? Your butt. Um, so you have to form, attach something of the same
481920	489440	color to all sides of it and then it'll explode. But you have a push. So say you have to push
489440	494640	in the spaces around them and you get a certain color that you'll push with and like say that
494640	499080	you're only on one side. We only push in one side, but say that you push in the dead center
499080	504880	of a circle of them, it'll push them all out all in that color. So you have to make the
504880	510440	little all six sides of one touch and sometimes you can get multiple, they're called blooms
510440	514000	and you see you get point multipliers and you also get little ones that if you hit them,
514000	517380	they destroy everything around them and all this stuff. But it's really hard. Like I'm
517380	525880	only on the 10th stage and there's a bunch of them and you have to get like 320 breaks
525880	531800	done and like the most I can get is 240. It's tough. But you were telling me the music kind
531800	536800	of adds to the game, right? The music is very trancey. It's very ambient trance. And, um,
536800	542620	as you do better, as your score goes up in that level, it's like, like for example, when
542620	549280	you break one blossom, that's seven points. If you get like a double, you get 14 awesome
549280	558800	blossom. If you get anyway, um, what was I saying? Oh yeah. So you get the, as you get
558800	563320	more points, the music gets more complex. But when you run out of pushes, like when
563320	570580	you get down to like five pushes, the music starts going really slow and it doesn't change
570580	578840	in pitch. It just changes in tempo. So it's just like, you know, really slow. And then
578840	585200	you're on your last push and then it just stops. And one thing that I really like about
585200	590760	is actually the type design in this game. It's really pretty. Of course. Well, it like
590760	595540	your, your levels come out on a diagonal. Um, your, when it gives you all your level
595540	601560	information and your scores, like I'll try to go in and do a screen cap of a level so
601560	607680	that I can show people what it looks like, but it's really gorgeous game. And like when
607680	613200	you choose your graphics settings, you have like good, bad, but when you start going better,
613200	618520	you have beautiful, you know, so it's pretty cool. And it starts off asking if you want
618520	624200	to play it windowed. Cause you look pretty from the two seconds I saw you playing it.
624200	631560	Yeah. Um, I'll uh, I'll put some screen caps. It's like it's six bucks right now on steam.
631560	636520	So go, go get it. All of you go get it so that they'll make more and maybe they'll make
636520	642240	a tutorial so that it's not so freaking hard. It's one of those games that's so hard that
642240	648000	it pisses you off until you have to beat it. I'm so mad. I will conquer you. All right.
648000	654800	You, you whore going on to a Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, it was okay. I played
654800	664640	a lot of Skyrim. Um, been exploiting the Dawn star, uh, hidden Khajiit treasure chest. Um,
664640	669040	actually did that for quite a bit last night. It's very rewarding because you get a lot
669040	676600	of loot and money and you get to kill somebody in their face over and over and over again.
676600	682960	So I like that phrase, kill someone in their face. Yep. You win the award of choice of
682960	690120	words today. Um, and then, uh, so I spent last night trying to take all the loot that
690120	699760	I got from Dawn star back to, um, uh, winter hold and what else did I do? Oh yeah. And
699760	705240	then, um, a little bit more in the quest of, uh, a night to remember, which is funny because
705240	711540	it's like a, this big long chain of random things that you did while you were drunk one
711540	718320	night cause you blacked out and can't remember. So it was kind of fun. And then I got a Mario
718320	722460	kart seven and Mario or super Mario three D land for the three DS this week. So I played
722460	727280	lots of Mario kart seven. I finished all the tracks, um, where all the circuits, I guess,
727280	736200	in a 50 CC and I started to play some one 50 CC stuff, but man, I mean, seriously, Nintendo,
736200	740960	I understand you got to ramp up the difficulty for one 50 CC, but the rubber band AI is just
740960	748320	so retarded. It's just ridiculous. The amount of it's like, do I really need to be hit with
748320	753000	like two blue shells, five red shells and you know, lightning all at the same time.
753000	757000	Oh, and thank you for doing lightning right as I'm jumping over a cliff. It's like I'm
757000	763040	playing with fucking assholes in, you know, Mario kart seven. I mean, it's just the computer's
763040	767920	like, ha, suck it bitch. You're over it. You're in the worst spot possible for a lightning
767920	772800	bolt and lightning bolt. That's what you're going to get. It's like, I hate that too.
772800	775680	They just, they always seem to know right when you're going over like a big jump and
775680	778960	that's when they're going to hit the lightning bolt or right before you get there. It's just,
778960	782680	that's irritating. You know, it's like, I can be way ahead of everybody else. And you
782680	788800	know, here comes Mario. It's like, Oh, I'm sorry. Mario got like five, uh, five superstars
788800	794160	in a infinite boost all at the same time. Oh, and he's a dragon. It flies now for some
794160	798920	reason. Um, but yeah, it's, it's a fun game. It's Mario Kart. I mean, we expect, um, I
798920	803880	did like some of their choices though for the retro courses. Although I got to say this,
803880	809080	um, my least favorite course in that game has to be probably the, uh, Neo Bowser city.
809080	814480	It's just such a waste. I mean, it could have been cool, but it's just like, you know, I
814480	818520	don't know. It's such a waste of course. I like this black Wolf in our chat room. Of
818520	822540	course the, the man Bobby black Wolf who comes on before us here at all games radio, uh,
822540	828400	says Mario Kart is the original asshole Mario. You ever seen that mod for super Mario world
828400	833840	asshole Mario? That's, that's a very good comparison. I don't remember like the AI being
833840	837480	that bad and like the original game and stuff. I mean, what for the CC was pretty hard, pretty
837480	842200	bad in the original game. It was pretty, maybe the rubber banding was infuriating. Like that's
842200	845440	just all they would do. It wasn't so much the shell cause there was no blue shell in
845440	849600	the original Mario. I fucking hate the blue shell. I seriously think it's the worst thing
849600	856880	ever. It's just like, it's the, the lightning. It's like the participation award of Mario
856880	864200	Kart. It's like, I suck. I need a show that kills first place. The honorable mention.
864200	867520	That's the ribbon. But no, no, the lightning bolt was supposed to be your, that was in
867520	870680	the original Mario Kart and the lightning bolt was supposed to be the like, fuck everybody
870680	875080	up thing, you know? And that was like the, I am in control. I'm powerful, you know, pass
875080	879320	everybody. Blue shell too much. And I don't like it. All the items aren't, I mean, it
879320	883280	gives you better items obviously in the further back that you are. Fuck that. It should be
883280	890080	even all around. Why shouldn't I be getting green shells and banana peels for being in
890080	894800	first place? I will say though, online I got one of those seven power ups that gives you
894800	899320	just seven fricking items and bam, bam, bam, just firing them all. That was pretty awesome
899320	903880	and I, I made up a lot of space with that one and I know people didn't like me. But
903880	908080	here's the thing. I think that power up sucks. I think in most of it's useless. It's just
908080	915520	like whatever. Are you kidding? I fucked some people up with that. It was awesome. All right.
915520	921840	So there, yeah, Mario Kart. It's pretty awesome. Looking forward to playing it online. Um,
921840	924960	what else? Oh, Super Mario 3 Land. I can't really say too much about it cause I really
924960	928360	didn't get a chance to play it much cause I've been playing mostly Mario Kart. I did
928360	932840	try a little bit of it and I got through maybe a quarter of the first stage in the, you know,
932840	938080	the very first level and then I had to quit. So, I mean, it looks pretty and it plays like
938080	943360	a Mario game. Um, I don't know. That's really all I can say right now. It kind of reminds
943360	949480	me a lot of, you know, Mario 64 I guess. Um, but in the, the setup's kind of a little bit
949480	954400	like Mario Galaxy. But, I mean, that's it. I mean, I'm looking forward to playing more
954400	962960	of it. Although, I'm looking forward to playing more Mario Kart than I am Mario 3 Land. Um,
962960	967720	and then, uh, what else did I play? Oh, I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 3
967720	976280	the 10th anniversary edition on my iPod. And it looks nice. But damn, I really wish there
976280	980320	was like Bluetooth support for some sort of controller because it sucks trying to control
980320	984320	that on the... I knew the touchpad was gonna be terrible for that. Well, I mean, it's,
984320	989160	it's, it's good for touch controls, I guess. I mean, but, I mean, there's not a lot you
989160	994840	can really do with touch controls on a game like that. I mean, they have it set up, it
994840	1000280	may make sense, but it's just, touch controls suck all the time for a game like that. I
1000280	1005280	mean, I even tried playing like some of the Gangstar stuff, um, before and it's just,
1005280	1011240	it doesn't work. But, it looks nice. I just hope that someday Apple will, you know, wise
1011240	1015360	up and actually have, you know, some sort of controller that would work with some of
1015360	1019680	these games. I know that some third party companies have done that, but obviously most
1019680	1023080	of the games don't support that. Yeah, that thing for the iPad's pretty awesome. The little
1023080	1026560	arcade machine that you can put it in. Well, that's not so bad. A coworker of mine had
1026560	1031240	this awesome, like, keyboard looking thing that the iPad kind of plugged into the top
1031240	1035720	of the flat keyboard and it made it look like a laptop that you could touch the screen on.
1035720	1041480	It was, it was nice. Hmm. I mean, so, it would be kind of neat if they did something like
1041480	1046240	that because, damn, I mean, it really sucks that some of these games, just the touch controls
1046240	1053240	are not good. Alright, anything else? Uh, words of friends, because my wife wants me
1053240	1059320	the player, and so I'm playing a little bit of that. Uh, and please, you know, I've been
1059320	1064120	getting invites to SimSocial, I am not fucking playing the SimSocial, so you can just save
1064120	1068400	yourself some time. I deleted it and blocked it. Do not send me any more invites for that
1068400	1074920	game. Yep. I'm over it too. Alright, um, quickly, getting into my gaming week, um, not a whole
1074920	1080960	lot. Call of duty. Shush, you're done. Not a whole lot of new stuff in my week. Uh, still
1080960	1085840	more wow, still more Saints Row the Third, which is, uh, fun. I, I'm loving all the little
1085840	1088960	activities in that game, it is so over the top. I never thought I would enjoy this game
1088960	1092640	as much as I do, but Loki, I hate to say it, you were right, you were so right, this game
1092640	1097760	is great. I love it. And I did, I played one of the Tron things, like the, the bike thing
1097760	1101800	that, it's kind of like light bike mixed with the Sonic 2 bonus level. Yeah. I think it's
1101800	1107240	kind of, well, let me put it this way. It's kind of basic, but it does Tron better than
1107240	1112360	the Tron PS3 game did bike racing, which was awful. The bike racing, like, killed that
1112360	1119200	Tron game. It was so bad. So. I thought it was, it was weak, but it's still better than,
1119200	1125800	yeah, yeah. It's better than Yaris. Um, but not by much. Uh, let's see. Uh, also some
1125800	1129720	new games I've been playing, not really a new game, but like Dark Soccer, I bought the
1129720	1134560	indie bundle and I can't stop playing Cave Story, which is like a years old game, came
1134560	1139080	out in a new one on the 3DS and dah, dah, dah, but Cave Story Plus to be specific is
1139080	1143240	the one that you get with the bundle. If you pay more than the average, I love it. Like
1143240	1147640	if you haven't played this game, you should definitely, I mean, for one, this indie bundle
1147640	1151800	that's out right now is amazing. And I know there's a story coming up on the show later.
1151800	1157800	We'll tell you all the games that are in it, but it's, it's just such a great cause, great
1157800	1161720	deal, great games. And especially the games you're getting this time around, like what?
1161720	1165960	Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner. Yeah. You convinced me with Bit.Trip Runner. Oh,
1165960	1170200	Bit.Trip Runner is a great game too. So, um, yeah, but Cave Story, it's kind of like, it
1170200	1174320	reminds me of an old NES game, obviously with the graphics and the music, the music's great.
1174320	1177880	And I guess now you get the soundtracks, which is awesome. Uh, and it kind of reminded me,
1177880	1182560	I wanted to say, I don't know why, but like Fashanadu, you remember that game? Uh, it
1182560	1186120	kind of reminded me of that a little bit, even though it wasn't really the swords, but
1186120	1190160	it was kind of like that exploring the different multiple screens and kind of the music reminded
1190160	1196200	me of it a little bit. So yeah, Cave Story's awesome. I like that game. And, um, otherwise
1196200	1201760	been playing some old school Game Boy advanced games as a 3DS ambassador, namely WarioWare
1201760	1205360	is the one that I can't stop playing. The original WarioWare was so good. And I'm so
1205360	1209880	glad that that's a part of the, uh, ambassador package. Cause that, that alone is worth it.
1209880	1215720	So yeah, that's pretty much it for my gaming week otherwise. Um, so we're going to move
1215720	1219680	on into some housekeeping before I get into housekeeping. I want to talk quickly. Uh,
1219680	1223920	we're going to have an interview in a little bit and it's with my friend Justin. He's going
1223920	1228800	to call in in about five minutes or so after we get through some other announcements here.
1228800	1233440	And he's going to talk to us about his Xbox hack experience. And, um, I know you guys
1233440	1236920	have heard about mine and I came on here and I bitched about it and how I couldn't play
1236920	1243400	my Xbox for 20 days and it was pretty bad and all this, but like my story has got nothing
1243400	1248280	on what you're about to hear Justin talk about. And I thought it was important to get it out
1248280	1253580	there that this is happening because when you guys hear like the, the hoops he's jumping
1253580	1256740	through and what's going on, your jaw will be on the floor and like, he's not making
1256740	1262520	it up. It's all legit. Like I trust Justin. Justin, uh, met at E3 and, and, uh, you know,
1262520	1266920	we hung out and stuff, so I know it's all legit and it's, um, you're going to be shocked.
1266920	1269640	So we'll get to that in a little bit, but first, um, some important housekeeping we
1269640	1274240	wanted to cover tonight. Um, there will be no show next week. Uh, most important, uh,
1274240	1278360	our show happens to be on December 25th, which, uh, you know, it's kind of a big deal for
1278360	1284260	some people. Um, and, uh, so yeah, no show that night. Bobby will still be live. So if
1284260	1287360	you're at all games radio and you're like, I'm lonely, I want to party with somebody
1287360	1292120	on Christmas. Bobby will still be here at five o'clock Pacific. We will not. And, um,
1292120	1297620	even also, uh, I'm kidding. Love, love. I said on Twitter and I said on Facebook and
1297620	1304800	I wasn't lying. Um, we have to say goodbye tonight. And, um, things change. And, um,
1304800	1309560	Dark Sakura, uh, well, do you want to tell the listeners what's going on? I don't know
1309560	1319720	how much you don't want to say, but I'm leaving. I'm moving. It's been coming for a while and
1319720	1324120	it's finally happened. And I know I've brought it up before, but the move is actually happening.
1324120	1334160	Um, we had pack up and be out and so we are moving down the street. So we're saying goodbye
1334160	1340320	to the orange lounge radio studio five. Bye. But maybe you made someone's heart skip a
1340320	1344720	beat there a little bit, but unfortunately that was so awesome. That was a, it was, it
1344720	1349080	was looking pretty scary there for a minute that you might have to move. Yeah. Dan still
1349080	1354640	wants us to go to Washington, but I'm like, so, um, so this is the fifth. You will still
1354640	1359040	have a show me at your feet. Yes, I will. That'll be great. Uh, this is the fifth studio
1359040	1364000	that we've taped to orange on radio in. Um, the first was that house that I had with Brian
1364000	1367560	back in the day. I don't think ever came on the show, but that was, that house was the
1367560	1372240	first studio. The second studio was when Loki and I lived together. Uh, the third studio
1372240	1375840	is when the extra for and I lived together and that was a lot of change to the station.
1375840	1380120	That was the studio where the news came out and filmed us. That was a studio where we
1380120	1385680	switched to all teams radio. By the way, what's that? They also came to your guys's place
1385680	1391320	to yours and Loki's. Oh, that's right. The paper did. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I got a foot
1391320	1399380	on there. Fantastic. So, uh, let's see. And then, um, the news did come here. The net,
1399380	1404040	the fourth studio was when I was in the house in the garage, in the garage, the cold, the
1404040	1411000	jet, the one that's on Justin TV, super hot. Sometimes the garage with no steady temperature.
1411000	1416160	And then we've been in this studio for well over a year. It's been at least, yeah, probably
1416160	1421960	almost two years, but my house is comfortable and has a heater. And sure me, you've got
1421960	1426920	sure me to keep your feet warm. So, um, and by the way, there's a, our chats finally catching
1426920	1430600	up with a buffer and everything. Just reading a, some of our chat room chat that orange
1430600	1435840	on twitter.com red said, you guys had me for a sec. Uh, bochi Kawa says, OMGs. I was scurred.
1435840	1440520	Uh, catastrophic. Moggy says, yeah, my heart did skip a beat. Rob and Darth spasinator
1440520	1445700	sums it up best. Damn you. Dark Sakura making us think you're leaving OLR. That was good.
1445700	1450240	You did that very well. Orange rice said, oh, you trolls, but no, I mean, but it is
1450240	1454320	still, I mean, obviously the studio is a big part of the show and, and here's the interesting
1454320	1460120	thing. Um, you know, we're, we had a planned week off next week. Anyway, we're going to
1460120	1466760	be back in two weeks. Hopefully it's looking like 90% sure we'll be back in two weeks.
1466760	1470080	There is a strong possibility though. We may not, we may not be set up in time because
1470080	1475160	we are now unexpectedly having to move the studios. Um, the, the office is going to be
1475160	1478760	a little smaller. I can tell you that, but we'll, we should be fine. We also don't exactly
1478760	1482640	know where studio six is going to be. We think it's going to be a dark sacros. You just have
1482640	1487140	to make sure it's going to work cause it might come back to where I'm at. So from an undisclosed
1487140	1491480	location is where the next orange lounge radio will be. So it's going to be a whole new year,
1491480	1499480	a whole new OLR, but what an appropriate way to kick off our 10th year of radio from 2002
1499480	1505320	to 2012 with a new studio. You know what, I'm going to go ahead and say it. What's that?
1505320	1511280	Fuck you, Wells Fargo. What's that for? Oh, cause I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Why we're moving.
1511280	1520120	You know what, honestly, it's not even, it's, it's a case of overextension when with combined
1520120	1528360	with the housing market drop is what facilitated our situation. But man, I tell you, apartments
1528360	1534280	are freaking expensive. And then like we got a house for what apartment rent for a smaller
1534280	1540780	place would have been. So it's really expensive where Dan works too. But I mean, so right
1540780	1547600	now though, and we got a good landlord who is really going to work with us. So, and honestly
1547600	1552600	we found his house, called him the next day. Two days later we're in. Nice. So yeah, I
1552600	1556400	worked out really well. I'm sure people who followed me on my Facebook knew about the
1556400	1561180	drama. So, uh, Tiger Claw on chat says, I guess the studio where you and Travis did
1561180	1564800	the shows was studio number one. I didn't count that one cause we didn't do orange lounge
1564800	1567920	radio from there. That was under station live, different show. And besides, he didn't really
1567920	1572400	call that studio one. I believe that was what the masturbation station inside the pleasure
1572400	1578640	dome, beautiful inbred Sacramento. I don't know, whatever he called it. So no, that,
1578640	1584840	that, that didn't have a number. That was studio zero. Um, let's see. Uh, and, uh, Zethur
1584840	1588880	says, I knew you guys were joking. We're not joking. We are saying goodbye to the studio.
1588880	1596360	Yeah, no, we were joking. I am leaving this house. Dark Sakura is moving. We have to be
1596360	1604200	out of here by the third so that we get money. So yeah. Oh, and, and Bobby, just to let you
1604200	1610480	know, um, our next step is to buy a house. So yeah. Good luck. All right. So, um, we'll
1610480	1616000	be back in two weeks from somewhere. Welcome to adult life kids. This is what you have
1616000	1620160	to look forward to. Growing up sucks. Life's going to suck when you grow up. When you grow
1620160	1623600	up, when you grow up, life's going to suck when you grow up. It sucks pretty bad right
1623600	1627760	now. Uh, okay. So I guess that's, what else can we say about that? I don't think there
1627760	1632760	is anything else to say about that. So goodbye studio five after tonight. Maybe the good
1632760	1636880	news is maybe we can get a webcam again. Maybe we can be better wired to stream games because
1636880	1641880	this studio is really kind of supposed to get a rig. Well, wasn't supposed to be temporary.
1641880	1647760	Yeah. You're on my drawing table. It just kind of lasted. Although I got it at Ikea
1647760	1651680	and it's not really a drawing table. So whatever. I'm just glad to tell you though, our house,
1651680	1655200	our new house is super cute. You know what I just realized? What? This is one of my old
1655200	1661720	roommates folding chairs. I totally jacked it from him for the studio. So we can bring
1661720	1665240	a piece of the old studio with us. That's right. We can. But man, this house though
1665240	1670120	is super cute and we'll get to keep the pinball tables in the living room. That's good. Pinball
1670120	1675120	tables are important. Our landlord walked in today cause he came in to sign the papers
1675120	1681920	with us and he looked in the, in the pinball room. It was like, what is this? We're like,
1681920	1687320	this is our coolness, sir. It was like, I haven't seen pinball in years. I was like,
1687320	1695440	that's super cool. You knock off a few hundred dollars a month and uh, yeah, maybe traded.
1695440	1701000	Well we, I offered up my services to if any of his grandchildren needed posters made for
1701000	1708200	their projects. Nice. So cause I'm shameless. I'll work for anybody. I'm a designer, dammit.
1708200	1712400	Give me design stuff to do. All right. Um, I think we're going to move into some of tonight's
1712400	1715560	news, but we need to be a little bit flexible cause the interview should be calling in any
1715560	1718840	minute. So we might have to kind of like go, go cause there's a live interview tonight.
1718840	1723800	So if you want to ask questions, you can in chat.orangelandraday.com. Um, so Loki, I guess
1723800	1726600	go ahead and try and start us off here. We might have to kind of cut it in the middle
1726600	1731920	here. Sure. Why not? Um, if there's a report coming from Bloomberg, same, and this is basically
1731920	1735800	saying something that they've already kind of rumored to before. Microsoft is going to
1735800	1739720	create its own TV programming for Xbox live, which is great cause I was hoping they would
1739720	1746120	kind of do that cause as much as I like to see on demand stuff for Comcast, which I can
1746120	1750920	get by an on demand, well I used to be able to get via on demand, but unfortunately now
1750920	1757480	we have a terrible, terrible, really low tech cable box that doesn't have on demand. Not
1757480	1762480	that I care. Um, but it would be nice to see extra content on top of the stuff that's already
1762480	1765240	there. And honestly, I haven't really looked at some of the other stuff that they have.
1765240	1770600	I looked at YouTube and TMZ and all that this week and it's kind of weak. I didn't, I, I
1770600	1775160	mean, I guess, yay, you can look at YouTube's on your Xbox, but I don't like the interface.
1775160	1779500	They really just force everything to use that, that new interface and it doesn't really work
1779500	1783320	well for something like YouTube. I feel like if I want to watch something, what I really
1783320	1788640	need to do to make it work is to go queue it up on my computer, in my playlist, and
1788640	1793580	then go to my Xbox and watch it on the Xbox. I mean, if you want to watch like popular
1793580	1796920	YouTubes and things like that, like that's really easy to find cause it shows you the
1796920	1801000	most popular. What about like a stuff you're subscribing to? Is it easy to find that? Um,
1801000	1804560	yeah, that, that, that does all kind of pop up. It's not, it's not bad. You can link it
1804560	1809600	to your YouTube. Basically, um, you say link to my YouTube account and it'll show you a code on
1809600	1812800	the screen and you go run to your computer and type that code in while you're signed
1812800	1817200	into Google and then it links the two together. Kind of like how Netflix works. So, but it
1817200	1822840	works. I mean, it's fantastic. Why? I don't know. This sounds stupid. Here's, here's the
1822840	1828720	thing and I don't know if you know this, Logie. Um, you can't watch any clip that's been flagged
1828720	1833280	for copyright content. Like, you know how like YouTube will keep some of the copyright
1833280	1837280	content stuff up, but it'll just have a link to whatever song is being used in it at the
1837280	1841480	bottom. You know, say like this has stuff from UMG music group and click here to buy
1841480	1848520	the song though. All of those are pulled from Xbox live, which I act, I get why because,
1848520	1852360	you know, there's all the jukebox usage rights and all that stuff and they don't want to
1852360	1857080	pay it, but it does put a damper on some of the things that you want to really watch on
1857080	1861960	YouTube. But like I would think like, okay, like the way that Jamie and Dan have it set
1861960	1866720	up, they watch YouTube's a lot on their TV of like game play throughs and stuff, but
1866720	1871080	I don't think they should have to change that. But not everybody sets up a rig like that.
1871080	1874240	Yeah. Well, here's the thing though. It's like an, and I understand that it's kind of
1874240	1878040	cool that they have that and stuff, but I'll, I'll tell you this much. To get a rig to actually
1878040	1885880	watch YouTube videos on a TV, um, is fucking dirt cheap. I mean, so dirt cheap. It's ridiculous.
1885880	1891000	I remember actually one time, uh, well I was last year actually that, um, not actually
1891000	1895280	this year, I was doing that, was it project under $100 thing where I was going to create
1895280	1898880	a main cabinet under a hundred dollars. Yeah, whatever happened to that? Yeah, I just didn't,
1898880	1902680	I didn't want to build a main cabinet out of cardboard boxes. So I came out to $101
1902680	1907320	and you were like, shit. No, no, I was able to do it under a hundred dollars, but, um,
1907320	1910640	I just didn't want to. I saw the computer and stuff though in my garage, but I bought
1910640	1915600	the computer for 30 bucks. It's a Pentium 4 for 30 bucks and it was, I mean, it's capable
1915600	1920760	of running MAME and most of the games for, but a Pentium 4 computer can also run YouTube.
1920760	1925680	I mean, I think for the most part and hell, you can even get like, you know, mini ITX
1925680	1930440	computers or Adam computers or whatever. Um, very, very dirt cheap if you want to set up
1930440	1935240	something that's mainly for watching YouTube videos or fuck any other, if you have a computer
1935240	1940800	at home, it's moving next to the computer, you know, to your TV and you can watch videos
1940800	1946460	that way. I mean, that's, it's just a lot easier than having the fuck around with these
1946460	1951760	apps and stuff. And to me, it's sad that they have it that way. That's so difficult to just
1951760	1952760	have it work.
1952760	1955720	I'm going to jump in here. We're going to come back to the subject in a little bit,
1955720	1958840	but as I promised a little bit earlier, um, I'm waiting for a phone call and that phone
1958840	1961320	call is coming in right now. So, hi caller, are you there?
1961320	1962320	Hello.
1962320	1964720	Hey, is this Justin?
1964720	1965720	Sure is.
1965720	1969120	What is up Justin? First off, thank you so much for calling in tonight. Um, you're like
1969120	1971680	on vacation or something right now, right?
1971680	1977520	I am. I'm a halfway home from Disneyland. Me and the lady, uh, drove out there. I got
1977520	1979280	a couple of days. We're heading back to Vegas now.
1979280	1982920	Nice. I saw you did my tip at Haunted Mansion on Foursquare.
1982920	1987440	Yeah. Yeah. I think you left a couple tips throughout Disneyland and I did whatever I
1987440	1988440	found.
1988440	1991680	I probably did. Well, that's awesome. Well, anyway, um, Justin, thanks for calling in
1991680	1995340	tonight. Um, I, let me, I tried to give a little bit of background before you called
1995340	1999280	in tonight, but I know everybody knows you're calling in to talk about Xbox hacks tonight
1999280	2003360	and I got to say, I've been following your updates through Twitter because you and I
2003360	2008360	got hacked kind of around the same time, but it seems like your shit has been going on
2008360	2016600	forever. And yeah, it lasted four months and I've, I've seen your updates on Facebook and
2016600	2020600	it came to the point where I'm like, Justin, I, I need you to call in and tell this story
2020600	2026000	because people need to hear how bad Microsoft is dicking people around with this. So I think
2026000	2028480	for people to better understand this, let's go back to the beginning.
2028480	2034240	So let's talk about day one. First time you ever found out your Xbox got hacked. What
2034240	2035880	happened? How'd you find out you were hacked?
2035880	2040920	All right. Uh, let me start by saying I am on the road and if signal cuts out, you know,
2040920	2044360	I'll call back, but just let me know if the signal starts cutting out, we'll, we'll make
2044360	2051840	it work. So day one back in August, it was like August, uh, mid August, say the 13th,
2051840	2059560	14th, something like that. Uh, I get an email saying that, uh, my, the, what was it? I got
2059560	2065560	a purchase confirmation for, uh, altogether $125 worth of Microsoft points.
2065560	2070400	Was it all that FIFA stuff? Was it the FIFA stuff?
2070400	2073200	What's that? Was it the FIFA 12 stuff that it seems like
2073200	2078080	No, actually, uh, the FIFA stuff, I, mine had nothing to do with any of the FIFA stuff.
2078080	2083880	I heard a ton of people get screwed over by the FIFA thing. Uh, and apparently that was
2083880	2088480	because there's something you can do on FIFA where it equates to real money. I guess that
2088480	2094640	like people are building these super teams at FIFA, uh, by purchasing, uh, players, uh,
2094640	2100240	they have booster packs basically. And then they're selling the killer teams on Hebay
2100240	2104040	or what have you. So that's why people get screwed over with the FIFA stuff. But mine
2104040	2109320	was not related to that at all. I got one confirmation for 75 bucks and then another
2109320	2117720	one for 50 bucks. Uh, I got, I found it probably a couple hours after it happened. So I went
2117720	2122360	in, I checked, uh, checked all my stuff. I had to reset my password to get in there.
2122360	2127840	Saw that they had bought a bunch of, uh, I think they bought Alan Wake, Resident Evil
2127840	2136040	5, uh, some DLC for both of those, Assassin's Creed brotherhoods, DLC for that, some themes,
2136040	2140200	uh, and then just some other miscellaneous stuff. But it was all just kind of random
2140200	2145320	stuff. I thought that they had played a little bit of them. So I called Microsoft, well first
2145320	2149600	I called the bank. I called bank of America and I said, Hey, fraudulent charges, yada
2149600	2153320	yada. They said, okay, we'll just take care of it. Next day they had my money back. So
2153320	2158000	no problems there. I called Microsoft right after I called the bank and I told them what
2158000	2162000	had happened and they said, okay, well, uh, we're sorry this happened. We're going to
2162000	2166960	close your countdown while we look into it and we'll have this taken care of within 25
2166960	2172440	business days or something like that. There would be no longer than 25 to 30 days.
2172440	2175440	One thing I want to jump in here and point out real quick, just one small difference
2175440	2178880	between what you did and what I did is that you called your bank first and I didn't do
2178880	2184680	that. I called, or I called Microsoft first and I think, yeah, I find that kind of interesting
2184680	2188200	because I wonder if that's part of the reason why here's story's going to take a different
2188200	2192760	turn here in a minute. But anyway, sorry. I just want to point that out. Go ahead.
2192760	2199320	Okay. So yeah, I, uh, I waited a little while, uh, probably three or four weeks and then
2199320	2202160	I called back and said, Hey, just checking in. Just want to see what's going on. And
2202160	2205800	I said, well, you know, we're still working on it. I said, okay, cool. So I waited a little
2205800	2210080	bit longer, a couple of weeks past. And at this point we're past the 25 days they had
2210080	2213760	voted me. So I called back and I said, Hey, uh, you know, you guys missed your deadline.
2213760	2218180	I just wanted to get a status update, find out what's going on. You know, same as before
2218180	2222920	they were apologetics. Uh, they didn't have any news for me. They told me there's nothing
2222920	2228600	they can do to, uh, figure out, uh, with any more detail what's actually going on. Uh,
2228600	2232720	now I just have to stick it out. So at that point I said, well, can you guys hook me up
2232720	2236080	with anything to make a support? They said, sure. Here's the code for a free month of
2236080	2241840	Xbox live. And, uh, they assured me that that would be on top of whatever time I get reimbursed
2241840	2245800	at the end of the whole fiasco. So I said, all right, we'll, we'll three months, a live
2245800	2252960	whatever hung up one about my business, few more weeks past. And I called back and, uh,
2252960	2257120	they said the same thing. I whined about it a little more. They gave me another code for
2257120	2262640	a month of live. And that was that few more weeks past. And this is the point where I
2262640	2269920	started taking angry Facebook posts, Twitter posts, Google plus posts, trying to get screwed
2269920	2272880	over here. At this point, you've said a few weeks, a few weeks, a few weeks. So you're
2272880	2278920	talking like you're at like 10, 12 weeks at this point, right? Were you somewhere between
2278920	2282980	two and three months, around two months is when I started getting really upset because
2282980	2286680	I wasn't playing my Xbox a whole lot. I figured at least I'll have this all sorted by the
2286680	2291160	time all the good games start coming out, I'll be able to play modern warfare three
2291160	2297440	and all that stuff. Right. So the, when I really got upset was the day modern warfare
2297440	2302440	three came out. Now I'm not a fan of the modern warfare series, but I figured this was going
2302440	2305720	to be here. I was going to get it, start playing with all my friends and get into all that
2305720	2309840	stuff. Well, I bought modern warfare three and then remembered, Oh, wait, I can't play
2309840	2315280	online. So I called against that night and I said, look, this wasn't a problem before
2315280	2319120	the games are starting to come out that I want to play. So I need to have this fixed
2319120	2324200	and same thing, just, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I don't have any more information.
2324200	2330280	We're very sorry this happened, but there's nothing we can do. So what else can I do?
2330280	2333840	You know, I was starting to feel pretty hopeless at this point. I said, okay, well deal with
2333840	2339640	it. And I went, played some, I started playing something on my Wii, I think. I went back
2339640	2346160	and started playing Mario Galaxy or something. So a couple more weeks passed and I'm at the
2346160	2349920	point where I'm telling them every time I call like, look, I'm going to call every week
2349920	2356880	now and keep on doing this until I, until I get a result. And I did so I kept on calling
2356880	2361000	and every time they just would give me the run around and say, no, there's nothing we
2361000	2370800	can do. So about a week ago I called and I don't know about a week ago I got an email
2370800	2375760	saying, Hey, we see that you got, you regained access to your account. So we're closing your
2375760	2381680	case, have fun. And I was on my way to work at this time so I could check on it immediately.
2381680	2386240	But when I got to work, I went online and I checked it out and I still couldn't get
2386240	2390840	to my account via xbox.com and still said your account is temporarily blocked.
2390840	2394720	And to point this out, you're talking from August to a week ago, December.
2394720	2400640	Yeah. Yeah. From mid August until last week. So I got the email that said that everything
2400640	2405120	was good. I went to xbox.com and found out that everything was not good because I still
2405120	2410480	couldn't get to my account. So I called them on my lunch break and I said, look, I got
2410480	2414640	this email. I mean, it's been going on since August, try and understand my frustration
2414640	2419360	here. Like I apologize upfront because I knew I was going to get hostile at some point during
2419360	2427040	a phone call. So I told them the whole situation, let them read over my case notes, gave them
2427040	2433000	like three service requests numbers I had, uh, told them, you know, I want to be able
2433000	2437080	to play my xbox. You know, I got this email, but I still can't get to my account. And they
2437080	2440480	said, Oh, okay, we'll go to your console. And I said, well, I'm not at my console on
2440480	2446080	my lunch break. So they said, all right, we'll call it back later when you're at your console.
2446080	2452480	And at this point I really felt like I would get ripped off here. So I asked them if they
2452480	2456400	could do anything like give me a year of xbox live to pick up for it. Cause what's a year
2456400	2462880	of xbox live, 40 or 50 bucks. Right. Right. So, so I asked them that and they said, no,
2462880	2467280	actually we can't do that. That's kind of what I was expecting, but I will talk to someone
2467280	2471640	who can hook that up and she said, well, let me talk to my supervisor, but you won't be
2471640	2475800	able to do anything either. So supervisor came on, told her the whole situation after
2475800	2481520	a year of life. She said, no, I can't do that. I can get you, uh, two extra months. We see
2481520	2485800	that you already got two months before I can give you two more months and that I'll pick
2485800	2491280	up for the four months that you lost. And that'll be that. And at this point I'm a little
2491280	2497560	angry because before I got those two one month codes, they told me that those months would
2497560	2503680	be on top of whatever time I was reimbursed. So I relate this information to the supervisor
2503680	2507520	I was now talking to and she said, well, you were misinformed. We can give you two months
2507520	2515280	or not take it or leave it. And so I, I mean, I, I never, ever yell at people on the phone
2515280	2522080	because I know they have jobs and I would hate to be answered. So I blew up at this
2522080	2526720	point. I just, you know, kind of let her have it. I said, look, I mean, this is four months.
2526720	2530880	You don't, I don't think you understand how much trouble this has been for me. I've been
2530880	2536440	on the phone literally like five or six hours total with Microsoft trying to get this resolved
2536440	2541640	and all because don't jerk off, pack an alert bank account or hacked into my Xbox account
2541640	2547000	and spent a bunch of my money. Like I feel like I'm being punished for nothing. I did.
2547000	2553080	And she was not very receptive to that. She took kind of reiterated, I can give you two
2553080	2557240	months on top of two months where he gave you about that. So we went back and forth.
2557240	2560800	You know, I kept on saying that it's ridiculous. This is ridiculous. She kept sitting there
2560800	2568160	with nothing to do. Finally, she conceded and said, okay, well I'll give you 500 points
2568160	2575280	in addition to the two bucks. And yeah, exactly. I said, what is that, six bucks? Like is that
2575280	2580280	one of my five or six dollars? What does that translate to, five hundred bucks?
2580280	2581280	Six twenty five.
2581280	2582280	Yeah, six twenty five.
2582280	2586840	Six twenty five. Okay. So yeah, we're six dollars and twenty five cents for Microsoft
2586840	2590800	at the cost of that. And I told her like, you realize you're about to lose a customer
2590800	2596960	over, you know, 50 bucks, right? Because all I'm asking for is a year and a half, that's
2596960	2601680	it. She just kept on reiterating. She couldn't do anything. So I took what I could get from
2601680	2605680	her because my lunch break was over. I had to get back to work. I left her my contact
2605680	2611280	info and asked her to have her supervisor. Oh, right. I asked to speak to her supervisor
2611280	2616880	earlier on the call and she said that he wouldn't be in until the next day in the evening. So
2616880	2623200	she was apparently the highest level person I could talk to at that time. So, so anyway,
2623200	2628440	she said she would pass along my contact information to her boss and have him call me back, which
2628440	2634960	never happened, by the way. So later that night, I actually, sorry, when I got back
2634960	2639400	from lunch, when I was back in my office, I typed out that quick Google Plus post basically
2639400	2644800	saying like, this is what's going on. You know, an update because I posted probably
2644800	2649720	three or four times previous after each call and kind of updated everyone as to what's
2649720	2653320	going on. I don't know how many people actually cared or if it looked like I was starting
2653320	2659400	to be whining, but I had to get it out somewhere, you know, I just couldn't just let it go without
2659400	2667120	telling people what was going on. So, uh, I made that post on Facebook and Google Plus.
2667120	2673000	And at that point I linked to my public Google Plus post on my Twitter account and I cc'd
2673000	2679760	Toulouse and is that how you say his name? Toulouse? Toulouse? Anyway, that guy and Major
2679760	2683200	Nelson. And Major Nelson actually replied to me on Google Plus that, sorry, I had a
2683200	2688000	bad experience. Shoot me an email with your gamertag and your service request number and
2688000	2693280	let me see if I can figure out what's going on. So I sent him an email the next day. He
2693280	2698040	said, all right, cool. I'm going to investigate it. And a few hours later I got a call from
2698040	2706520	Beth at Exceptions Management. She was, yeah, they have an exceptions management department.
2706520	2713240	So I spoke to Beth for a while. She was amazing, super friendly, super personable, very empathetic,
2713240	2717080	helps me get everything sorted. She went and got my account unlocked for me while I was
2717080	2720040	on the phone, waited for me to make sure I could get into it.
2720040	2723600	Just to make it clear, just to make it clear before, just to make it clear, before you
2723600	2728520	could get to this person who could actually handle your issue and take care of everything
2728520	2731760	right there on the spot. It sounds like she had the button. You had to go through Major
2731760	2736160	Nelson to get to her. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let's step back even further here. They
2736160	2744000	have a department for people that make exceptions to the rule. What?
2744000	2747840	I pointed out to her like, you know, this would have been so much easier if the supervisor
2747840	2751680	earlier could have just taken care of this for me. And she said, no, they actually can't
2751680	2756160	do that. They don't have that ability. But Beth, who I was speaking to, didn't have the
2756160	2757160	ability.
2757160	2761360	I don't have the ability to help you. Oh my gosh. Okay. So, so Beth or whoever, finally,
2761360	2764560	it sounds like satisfies you. Like, you know, what, what, what did they hook you up with
2764560	2765560	in the end?
2765560	2770560	Yeah, well, so she took care of me and she was like, okay, well, we're all set. And without
2770560	2774600	even asking, she said, well, how about, you know, I know you have them for a year report.
2774600	2778120	How about six months? That's, you know, I think that's what I could really get away
2778120	2782520	with doing. At that point, I was just so happy that she was willing to help me and all that.
2782520	2786320	She kind of offered it without me bugging about it. I said, okay, six months is fine.
2786320	2791360	So she gave me a couple coats for, you know, two, three-month coats to redeem. And you
2791360	2795240	know, I was happy with that. I got a little something for it. I felt like Microsoft was
2795240	2800320	trying to appease me at that point. And I was just happy I could get back into my account.
2800320	2803680	So all's better, right? All's well that ends well, right? We're done?
2803680	2810760	Uh, well, not yet. Not yet. Uh, we're almost done. So I go home and I play a couple games
2810760	2814600	online. Everything's cool. Next morning I wake up and as I'm driving to work, I see
2814600	2820240	I get an email that says, Hey, we noticed you added a new email to your account, which
2820240	2827420	I did not do. And it's some Oscar hyphen four one eight at hotmail.com or something random
2827420	2832520	like that. And so, I mean, yeah, I got hacked again, less than 24 hours after this is all
2832520	2835880	resolved. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
2835880	2839680	wait, wait, wait. Put the brakes on. Hold on. You, you were out of your Xbox live account
2839680	2847400	for four months. Finally, thanks to major Nelson, you get back in 24 hours later, 24
2847400	2854240	hours later, you're hacked again. Yes. So I said, screw this. I'm not talking to Microsoft
2854240	2862000	again. Oh damn it. Now we're getting the service job. Hold on. Can you still hear us? Oh, hi,
2862000	2867840	go, go back. Go back a little bit. We lost you for a second. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so I got
2867840	2874840	the email. I, uh, sorry. Got a, that'll, I lost track there. Uh, let's say I walked in
2874840	2882000	on my phone to Xbox.com, went to change my password and all that stuff. Uh, as soon as
2882000	2886920	I got to work, I, you know, delete all my email accounts. I associated my account with
2886920	2890560	new email accounts, changed my password to something completely new that's never been
2890560	2896280	used anywhere. Uh, made sure that this person had not made any purchases on my account.
2896280	2900960	All my points were still there. There was no activity. So I just booted that email address
2900960	2907880	off my account and, uh, made everything, you know, brand new basically. So far since then
2907880	2912360	everything is cool. Okay. I have to ask these questions because listeners will kill me if
2912360	2916720	I don't ask these questions to get some things clear. You changed your password between the
2916720	2923080	first time and the second time, right? Yes. It was, it was not a brand new password. It
2923080	2927800	was one that I'd used in other places before. So one theory that I have is that maybe this
2927800	2933280	traces back to when all, you know, all the websites and Stoney and all that got hacked.
2933280	2938840	Maybe, uh, they got my password from something like that associated better, but it was not
2938840	2942640	my same password from before. But it was still different. They, they somehow got two different
2942640	2948320	passwords a year. Yeah. And I think, I was wondering also maybe they, uh, they hacked
2948320	2952600	into the email account that was associated with my Xbox account and that's how they were
2952600	2957120	doing it. Because if you have the email account, you can reset the password, you can get a
2957120	2961440	reset link sent to that email address. That could make sense. I don't know, maybe they
2961440	2965640	did something like that or maybe they did some social engineering and, uh, got a service
2965640	2970120	rupture request to reset it or something like that. But, you know, that stuff happens. I
2970120	2975200	usually pretty careful with this stuff. Do you think you were phished? Because I, that's
2975200	2979560	the line that Xbox has been saying is that, well, all these people are getting phished
2979560	2984280	and I'm like, the fuck I was getting phished. Man, I've been on the internet since I was
2984280	2989800	11 years old. I didn't get phished. Like I, I'm smarter than that. I don't click on links
2989800	2994640	that I don't know where they came from. Whenever I get any sort of email that says, hey, we're,
2994640	2998840	we need you to log in here or something like that, I don't click the link. I open a browser
2998840	3004880	and I type in the URL, you know, so I'm positive that I didn't get phished. And that's an easy
3004880	3009560	thing for a company to say, you know, put the blame on the users and make them think
3009560	3011520	that it's not their fault.
3011520	3016560	So, all right. So since, since we got to, we got to wrap this up and get back to the
3016560	3021040	show at some point, but I want to, I want to just kind of summarize here. You were hacked.
3021040	3026560	You went through four months of hoops. Finally, after getting Major Nelson involved, you speak
3026560	3030160	to the super secret department of Microsoft who can actually fix things when you talk
3030160	3033800	to them. 24 hours later, you're hacked again.
3033800	3040920	Yeah. So I want to, I want to make sure that I emphasize that Major Nelson, once I got
3040920	3045640	to that point, super helpful. Everything was taken care of pretty quickly. Microsoft just
3045640	3051860	really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the initial, you know, interactions.
3051860	3056040	When this happens, they need to be a lot more swift with this, their, their investigation
3056040	3061000	team, as they kept calling it, needs to be more accessible and they need to get this
3061000	3065560	stuff done faster because the fact that I had to get Major Nelson involved, I mean,
3065560	3070440	I felt terrible trying to get his attention on Twitter to get this taken care of in the
3070440	3076640	first place. But once I did, everything was taken care of. So I don't want to encourage
3076640	3081280	people to just tweet at Major Nelson when other things go wrong. But I mean, that's,
3081280	3085640	that's what I ended up having to do to make this work. That's just insane.
3085640	3088920	Yes. And you know, what else is insane is that I'm seeing, I'm looking in our chat room
3088920	3093200	at chat.orangetontrader.com and I see MXT is in our chat room saying, I'm going through
3093200	3097440	the exact same thing that the guy they're interviewing is. This story is crazy similar
3097440	3101480	to what I'm going through. Microsoft is telling me that I'm not properly verifying the account
3101480	3105640	details, even though I successfully verified everything to start the investigation and
3105640	3111760	I've been using the same information. So it's not just you buddy, but Microsoft denies there's
3111760	3112760	a problem.
3112760	3116960	Yeah. And I know that you got, you got hacked and I've heard a few other people like I,
3116960	3121760	I posted one that initially happened, uh, uh, I write for Nukesilla. So I posted a story
3121760	3126760	on there, uh, basically saying, Hey, I just got hacked. So PSA, you know, I want to change
3126760	3130800	your password. So I got a bunch of comments on there. Probably half a dozen people saying
3130800	3134920	the same thing was happening to them. And I Googled around, found a ton of other people
3134920	3138920	get hacked. So, I mean, it's not an isolated issue. This is something that's happening
3138920	3145880	a lot. I don't know what the common thread is, but it's not, uh, something that only
3145880	3149680	a few people are getting hit by. And I've talked to a lot of other people like friends
3149680	3153320	of mine who said, Oh yeah, I just had to go through that too.
3153320	3157600	So, so what happens from here? Do you, do you think this is something you can put behind
3157600	3161200	you in a couple months and say, all right, whatever, I'm a Microsoft fan again, woohoo,
3161200	3166840	Modern Warfare on my Xbox, pew pew. Or like, has this like permanently damaged things?
3166840	3172080	It's, I mean, there's, there's definitely permanent damage. Uh, I think it's insane
3172080	3179240	that Sony got basically crucified for the hacks a few months ago, but I can't think
3179240	3185000	of a single instance in which anybody actually got, there was any fraudulent credit card
3185000	3189400	activity. You know, I didn't care if anybody actually losing money over that, but this
3189400	3195520	is going on with Microsoft and it's widespread and there's no press about it. I mean, people
3195520	3197760	aren't talking about this.
3197760	3202800	What can Microsoft do to mend those, make amends?
3202800	3209000	They need to fix their security holes, whatever they may be, or, uh, maybe send out a force
3209000	3213260	password reset. I don't know. They need to, they need to do something about it. I think
3213260	3217260	people need to be talking about this more so that people are more aware they can go
3217260	3221880	and change their passwords. Oh, one more thing I wanted to add to my story because I forgot
3221880	3227760	to mention it in the middle of it. Uh, they called me about a month in and said they needed
3227760	3233040	my console ID and serial number. I did not have that with me, so I called back a couple
3233040	3236120	of days and gave it to them, but they tried to use that as ammo when they were talking
3236120	3240080	about how long it was taking. They said, well, we needed the console ID and serial number,
3240080	3245120	so that resets the timer. And I said, well, you know, that was three months ago, but I
3245120	3248840	just wanted to throw that in there in the interest of having all the facts.
3248840	3251400	Fair enough. Fair enough. Still four months is pretty shitty.
3251400	3256280	Console ID and the serial number. I mean, they probably already have it.
3256280	3258280	How about look at where he's logging in from.
3258280	3262600	It took him a month to even ask me for that.
3262600	3266560	Silly. All right. Well, Justin, I got to wrap up so we can get back to tonight's news, but
3266560	3269680	thank you so much for calling in and sharing the story with you. I don't know what else
3269680	3274540	to say. I'm glad you got resolution for Microsoft, but I agree with you. Microsoft needs to admit
3274540	3278040	there's a problem more than putting the, because what Microsoft's doing here, and there's a
3278040	3281680	pattern. It's what happened to you. It's what they're saying on the internet. It's what
3281680	3286000	they're saying to MXT. They're saying the user base is the problem. We're the problem.
3286000	3290560	We're getting phished. We're causing the issues. We're not providing the console ID numbers
3290560	3294560	in time. The customer is not right, is what I'm hearing from Microsoft.
3294560	3299360	No, I did not get phished. I mean, it's definitely something on Microsoft's end. I mean, I'm
3299360	3303320	still going to play games on my Xbox, but I'm definitely going to be playing more games
3303320	3305640	on my PS3 as well.
3305640	3309320	Hey, home just got a renovation there. It's worth checking out.
3309320	3314280	Well, I was just going to ask now, did you have the same email associated with your PlayStation
3314280	3317600	network account as you did with your Xbox Live account?
3317600	3319080	Yes, it was the same email address.
3319080	3320080	See, so that's the thing.
3320080	3322840	That's why I was thinking it might have something to do with it.
3322840	3327700	That's the thing is I think that what they're saying with these hacks is that it's not necessarily
3327700	3331880	that people are getting phished. I think it's just that people are getting in through their
3331880	3337200	email accounts. And it's not an intrusion to Microsoft's Xbox Live service. It's just
3337200	3342320	a different way. So people are getting phished that way or are getting hacked via their email
3342320	3343320	accounts.
3343320	3347880	Can I, I have to ask, DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?
3347880	3351240	Checking my account.
3351240	3355240	I recommend everybody do the same thing. For God's sake.
3355240	3360080	Everyone listening right now, log into Xbox.com right now. Change the email address associated
3360080	3363480	with your account. Change your password and change your security question.
3363480	3367720	I changed mine ages ago, but not well, not ages ago, but like about a month and a half
3367720	3368720	ago.
3368720	3373600	Right. Right. So, all right. Well, Justin, thank you again so much. And God, I hope it
3373600	3376520	I hope it doesn't happen a third time. What else can I say?
3376520	3378640	Well, thank you very much for having me.
3378640	3383160	All right. No problem. Drive safe. Oh, wait. Did you want to plug your site or anything?
3383160	3384160	What's that?
3384160	3387640	Did you want to plug your site or anything? I don't know if it's appropriate, but.
3387640	3394480	Oh, yeah, absolutely. Check out Nukeszilla.com. We're actually in the middle of a month-long
3394480	3400560	review, Nukes-travaganza right now, where every day we're writing a review of a game.
3400560	3404880	First day, we wrote one sentence for the review. Second day was a two-sentence review. That
3404880	3408800	was my Pokemon review, actually. Third day, we wrote a three-sentence review and so on
3408800	3409800	until the end of the month.
3409800	3410800	It is-
3410800	3411800	We're about halfway through that right now. Go check it out.
3411800	3415800	It is blowing up over there at Nukeszilla.com. All right.
3415800	3416800	Absolutely.
3416800	3417800	Take care, buddy.
3417800	3418800	Bye.
3418800	3419800	All right. Bye.
3419800	3420800	Bye.
3420800	3423080	Wow, wow, and more wow.
3423080	3427560	Apparently, MXT in the chat was saying that, oh, my God, they did the same thing to me
3427560	3431000	as far as asking for the console ID and serial number.
3431000	3434240	What's that? Oh, what's that?
3434240	3435640	That they did the same thing to him.
3435640	3437680	Oh, MXT, really? Oh, my gosh.
3437680	3438680	But, yeah, so-
3438680	3444080	Well, I mean, think about it. We don't have that big of an audience when you consider
3444080	3448880	the entire internet. We have, what, maybe 50, 60 people in chat right now, right? And
3448880	3453200	the fact that Justin's on the phone and one out of these 50 people is like, oh, yeah,
3453200	3458400	I'm going through this, too. What? This isn't a problem?
3458400	3459400	It's redonkulous.
3459400	3464240	Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
3464240	3469320	But it's the thing, though, is they're right in the fact that, yeah, it's not through-
3469320	3472920	I mean, if someone's getting access to your email account, how's that their problem?
3472920	3477280	I mean, that's not their fault that someone got access to your email because you happen
3477280	3481440	to use the same password that you use with the PlayStation Network stuff, and that list
3481440	3482440	got leaked out.
3482440	3486080	To be fair, Justin might have made a mistake if his email password and his Xbox Live were
3486080	3491120	the same. But, you know, whether he made a mistake or not, the hoops he's going through
3491120	3492120	is ridiculous.
3492120	3495800	But it doesn't even matter if those were the same because they can send a password reset.
3495800	3496800	Yeah, yeah.
3496800	3499320	But I think they still have to answer the security questions, if I'm ever correct. I
3499320	3500320	don't know.
3500320	3503440	I just want to say this real quick. Bobby Blackwell is sharing an idea with me. I don't
3503440	3507240	know if this will work for you or not. But he says, to help with the social engineering
3507240	3512780	aspect of it, change address line two in your account to read Xbox support. Do not assist
3512780	3518720	with recovery. That way, when the folks look at your account and see it, they won't try
3518720	3523280	to, you know, give- accidentally give out any information or make any changes or whatever
3523280	3527080	if somebody's trying to get it done that way. So, I find that interesting, an interesting
3527080	3528640	way to do it.
3528640	3532620	At the end of the day, honestly, I'm getting to the point where I'm using unique passwords
3532620	3536440	on different websites. Like, and it's kind of a pain in the ass to remember them all.
3536440	3539080	But it's like what I have to do. So, anyway.
3539080	3543200	All right. Moving on. We spent a good 20 minutes on that topic. But you know what? It's important.
3543200	3545880	And Justin's right. Not enough people are talking about it. And I said that back in
3545880	3549320	August. I'm saying it now. Like, at least we're finally saying like, okay, well, finally,
3549320	3554820	we're seeing that Xbox and EA's denying that there's a problem and warning people to not
3554820	3561160	get phished. I guess that's a baby step. But see, that's the thing, though, is they don't
3561160	3572840	even- you know, why didn't they just say, hey, you know, back- I mean, another video
3572840	3578320	game console provider or something like that, you know, was hacked earlier this year and
3578320	3584680	emails were leaked out. You may want to check that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if
3584680	3591880	they can't see that because that's, you know, untactful or whatever. But, I mean, obviously
3591880	3598800	there's something going on. There may be some sort of restrictions for how much you can
3598800	3600400	spend in a day or something like that.
3600400	3605400	I think they need to just do the force password reset. And they don't want to get right through
3605400	3609080	the holes like Sony did. They're scared shitless of what happened to Sony.
3609080	3614760	If they do a force password reset, people are going, why are you doing that? Oh, well,
3614760	3618040	because there's a lot of people getting hacked. I mean, they're not going to come out and
3618040	3620240	say that. It draws suspicion.
3620240	3625080	All right, let's move on with news. That took up a big chunk of time, so we want to quickly
3625080	3626080	get through this.
3626080	3629880	Real quick, to finish up the whole TV program, we think. So Bloomberg is saying that Microsoft
3629880	3634480	is on the hunt for a TV exec to handle the original programming. And they said they also
3634480	3644320	have some candidates with Mark Graboff and Jess Gaspin, two ex-NBC suits, I guess.
3644320	3648000	And they're saying that they're thinking the original programming via Xbox Live dashboard,
3648000	3653160	including like the Major's Minute, Xbox 101, et cetera, and also possible tie-ins with
3653160	3656720	like IGN, all that stuff.
3656720	3662120	Of course, they had MSNBC, so it makes sense to do that. And of course, this week they
3662120	3671600	had the launch of a few more applications, YouTube, TMZ, Verizon, FiOS, if you happen
3671600	3680960	to have that, and I believe, was it iHeartRadio, MSNBC, Muzu TV, if you're in some of the European
3680960	3693480	countries, Rogers On Demand in Canada, SBS On Demand in Australia, and RTVE in Spain,
3693480	3701880	and MSN Video in some of the European countries, and Blinkbox. All different streaming stuff
3701880	3702880	there.
3702880	3704400	TMZ, I haven't even looked at that. I don't even know.
3704400	3708560	I actually looked at the TMZ stuff. It's similar to the phone app. It's Celebrity Gossip. They
3708560	3713440	go out and get the videos, the raw footage of celebrities walking out of famous restaurants
3713440	3717920	and stuff. They do a live show that I think is broadcast on Sirius and all that. If you
3717920	3723000	like Hollywood gossip stuff, which I don't think many of you do, but that might be a
3723000	3724720	way for them to try and reach out to a different demographic.
3724720	3728240	Here's what I don't like about it, and I think it'd be awesome as if it was actually set
3728240	3733660	up like TV. Like you have channels. It would be awesome.
3733660	3737960	It's easier for me to log into a computer and type TMZ.com or hit a button on my phone.
3737960	3743480	I just don't think the Kinect interface is yet there. If I want to go check TMZ, I don't
3743480	3749320	go sit on my couch. Okay. Xbox, Kinect, TMZ, Bing.
3749320	3754300	I think they should have live TV or something like that as an option. They should have these
3754300	3759840	TMZ channels where they have some TMZ shows or whatever they're on at certain times, and
3759840	3765200	then you watch it actually like TV instead of having to... Because I think that would
3765200	3769000	be really cool, and that would get a lot more people interested in it because it's in addition
3769000	3774320	to their own TV. They can actually watch the Xbox TV instead of, oh, hey, look, I can queue
3774320	3777520	up all these videos. Yeah, you know what? You can do that with the PC, and I'm sure
3777520	3783120	most people out there have PCs even if you don't have an Xbox. Why would you bother downloading
3783120	3789160	this app and going through all this crap? It's more of a hassle.
3789160	3793440	Maybe once they have a remote control or something. I just don't think Kinect is as fast as they
3793440	3795960	want it to be. They do have a remote control. Do they? Yeah, maybe they have the little
3795960	3800240	infrared remotes. I agree with your whole thing. It needs to be channel up and channel
3800240	3803920	down or something like that to get to the stuff. It should be like web TV. Well, not
3803920	3811040	necessarily web TV, but like IPTV or something like that. Speaking of MSNBC, I want to break
3811040	3817680	in real quick with some real world news. What is it with world news going on in the middle
3817680	3822160	of our show? Because remember earlier this year, Osama bin Laden was reported dead and
3822160	3827120	all that. Well, they didn't kill anybody, but Kim Jong Il from North Korea has died
3827120	3832720	according to the Associated Press and it's on msnbc.com, which I mean, not to be crass.
3832720	3836760	I mean, it's sad when a world leader dies, I realize he's a controversial figure. I'm
3836760	3841040	just going to stay far away from that and just say, I believe it was reported he was
3841040	3846400	having, he had pancreatic cancer related issues. So, you know, and that was the same thing
3846400	3856000	that got Steve Jobs sadly. So that, um, cancer sucks. That's my point. So there you go. If
3856000	3860600	that, I mean, allegedly that's what obviously with world leaders, they're always very secretive,
3860600	3867360	but you know, there you have it. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, more gaming news. Who's
3867360	3873960	going to be making a death night of him in wow. And wow. Yeah. I remember my friend,
3873960	3880040	uh, from a hoard house. Matt, uh, had rip Steve Jobs already for the big day. All right.
3880040	3884640	Anyhow, uh, the circle pad is coming out in the U S that's of course the, you know, a
3884640	3888840	little attachment for the three ds and extra little thing there on the three ds. However,
3888840	3892720	uh, it's coming out February 7th, so it'll be out next year. It'll be $20, which I guess
3892720	3898800	is a reasonable price, but here's the deal. It's a GameStop exclusive yet again. Nintendo
3898800	3903000	has chosen to go the GameStop exclusive route, but this time I don't believe you can get
3903000	3908440	it on nintendo.com. Can you? I think you can only get this at GameStop. So if you want
3908440	3914760	the circle pad pro for 20 bucks, that will allow you a, an extra pad in resident evil
3914760	3920840	revelations, a metal gear, solid three d snake eater. Uh, you got to check that out at GameStop
3920840	3926240	only on February 7th. And I got two words for that. Fuck that. I hate this. I, you know,
3926240	3931160	you guys all know how I feel about it. It's no secret. I hate that it's all this exclusive
3931160	3935000	retailer stuff and I'm not going to support it and it pisses me off. I actually kind of
3935000	3939360	wanted that circle pad, but not for the reason you think. Um, I don't know about you guys,
3939360	3944120	but I've had my hand hurt playing Mario Kart because I don't think that the three ds is
3944120	3948880	very ergonomically designed very well because like my thumb like starts to hurt from the
3948880	3952320	acceleration button and trying to use the shoulder buttons for like a long period of
3952320	3955680	time. We have to kind of like hold the a button down. It's not bothered me in any other game
3955680	3959840	today. Like it doesn't bother me in Mario three d land. It only bothers me in Mario
3959840	3964080	Kart. But I was thinking if I had kind of the extension that that circle pad provides
3964080	3969560	that there's a more, more rest for my thumb there and it might work better, but I'm not
3969560	3973720	buying it this way. I guess I could import one, but I don't like that idea either. To
3973720	3977640	be honest, I guess I'm just going to have to wait for the three ds redesign that will
3977640	3982600	release the three ds they probably should have put out in the first place. Yeah, they'll
3982600	3988080	do a three ds redesign, but here's the thing I, and I suggested this on Twitter. Um, it's
3988080	3992600	a peripheral. There'll be third party solutions for it and there'll be probably third party
3992600	3997760	solutions. They're even better than it, you know, the official Nintendo one. So just wait
3997760	4003640	to wait to get it. I mean, um, there's no reason you need to rush out and do it. And
4003640	4008240	honestly, you know, before we were like saying, Oh, maybe the reason that GameStop has the
4008240	4016760	exclusive on, you know, Xenoblade is because, um, they may have helped to pay for the import
4016760	4023160	stuff, but for the circle pad, ah, I don't think so. I think that it's just, I don't
4023160	4031520	know, unless I was part of the Xenoblade stuff. Yeah, so I'm not happy about the whole thing,
4031520	4038760	but I don't know what, I don't know what Nintendo has to gain from this, to be honest, by being
4038760	4042000	in bed with GameStop so much. But here's the only thing I can think of. I hate that this
4042000	4045680	is a pattern. That they think that this is going to be a niche product and that they
4045680	4052200	don't want to save money. They're going to ship everything to one, one source, basically
4052200	4058640	GameStop, you know, cause they do this in distribution, um, all the time or even their
4058640	4063940	direct retail partners is that these companies will, to save money, they will drop retail
4063940	4070680	partners and make them go through distribution, um, to, you know, drop the amount of locations
4070680	4076200	to save on freight and just streamline everything so they don't have to ship to all these different
4076200	4082580	locations. They ship to five locations instead and let them sort it out from there. So maybe
4082580	4085840	that's what they're doing with this because they're thinking that they're just not going
4085840	4090240	to sell a lot of it. And yeah, I think they're right. They're not going to sell a lot of
4090240	4095440	it because it's not a peripheral that's absolutely needed for some stuff, but it's nice. But
4095440	4099880	once again, I mean, come on, this totally screams that they're going to do a revision
4099880	4103720	of this thing. Yeah, no, I, and I can kind of see where you're going with that. It is
4103720	4107440	a bit of a niche thing and, and you know, the developers are kind of in a, in a stuck
4107440	4114000	place. They can't really design games to require this, especially now, you know, like I think
4114000	4118000	ever if they're not going to be able to, well, hold on though, because the new Zelda game
4118000	4122400	requires Wii motion plus, which really wasn't a part of the week when they do a redesign
4122400	4126920	of the 3ds. Eventually I think they could start to require it kind of down the line,
4126920	4130000	but I don't think they could, it's going to be a good year or two. I mean, that's how
4130000	4133000	long games take to develop anyway. It's going to be a good year or two before that's required.
4133000	4135120	I think if they're going to start doing games that require stuff, they better do it sooner
4135120	4139120	than later because they want, you know, the least amount of consoles to be affected by
4139120	4147640	it. All right, well let's move on to Dark Sakura with some news. There's news. It exists
4147640	4159200	and this one is about Square Enix. The Square Enix members site actually was shut down and
4159200	4164040	according to Square Enix, they said that they were actually looking to see exactly how deep
4164040	4170640	the breach goes. It looks like it was indeed hacked. So they said that it was a server
4170640	4176360	that was used by members in the US and Japan and so they shut down the server so that they
4176360	4180960	can see exactly what's gone on. They said they can't confirm that there's any possibility
4180960	4187060	of credit card information leak since that server that was hacked doesn't contain any
4187060	4191160	credit card information. But they're going to look through it and double check everybody.
4191160	4198520	So if you were on there, your credit card's safe. If not, ain't your problem. So there's
4198520	4207600	that. At least it's not your Xbox getting hacked. At least nothing was taken. But once
4207600	4213960	again though, if you have your email associated with that Square Enix account that may also
4213960	4220240	be associated with a console or you may share a password on that site that you also share
4220240	4229280	on your console, you may think about changing that just to be on the safe side.
4229280	4233800	So there's been a lot of lawsuits against Sony for different things. One of the more
4233800	4241640	popular ones is the other OS removal and there was a class action lawsuit actually with Sony
4241640	4253160	about that. A federal judge has dismissed all counts of the suit. It's interesting though.
4253160	4260960	All of the claims have been dismissed I guess back in February. But I guess they amended
4260960	4268640	their claims and of course they dismissed the amended claims as well. The quote they
4268640	4276120	have from I guess Judge Richard Seaborg is in light of the prior amendment and the fundamental
4276120	4280400	shortcomings in the plaintiff's basic theory that it was wrongful for Sony to release the
4280400	4289720	software update in dispute, leave to amend will be denied. So they're not allowing them
4289720	4304320	to amend it again and they're basically dismissing it. So basically they allowed the people to
4304320	4312280	keep the other OS but they obviously had to decline the update and basically it was well
4312280	4317440	within Sony's rights to do that whether you like it or not. I think that's part of the
4317440	4320560	reason why you can use your license agreement so they can do that kind of stuff. You know
4320560	4325200	it's not what we were saying. And technically you know it wasn't an advertised feature on
4325200	4330680	the box even though it was something that they talked about and you know different developer
4330680	4336760	conferences and E3 and stuff like that. You mean the little fine notes there but it wasn't
4336760	4342460	something that they go hey you can run Linux on this because I mean but then again Linux
4342460	4346640	on anything anyway. Then again though you can still kind of run Linux on it if you know
4346640	4352600	you jailbreak it and give it an amount of time or some more time and jailbreaking will
4352600	4357800	probably be legal soon enough and then you can do what you want. But once again they
4357800	4365680	can also you know prevent you from playing online if they have that ability. Although
4365680	4370640	I mean if you think about it it's not only does you know the other OS thing doesn't necessarily
4370640	4376320	just stop you from playing online it stops you from playing new games because new games
4376320	4380280	require firmware updates that are included on the disk and those updates remove other
4380280	4390040	OS so it kind of sucks. Damned if you do damned if you don't. I mean just maybe maybe buy
4390040	4396760	a computer that do Linux instead of actually using you know your PlayStation 3 unless you're
4396760	4402280	the military and then you can buy a whole bunch of them just specifically for that but
4402280	4407600	it's just either going to be a computer or a game console. They're busy curing cancer
4407600	4414920	below their game. You can still do the folding at home without having the other OS stuff.
4414920	4418720	I never used the other OS. I thought about it for a while but just never got around to
4418720	4424720	it. I have a laptop with Linux on it. What do I need that for on my. Yeah I don't I think
4424720	4430960	if people are just looking for a reason to have their panties in a bunch. Yeah. So real
4430960	4437960	quick let's talk a little bit. Yeah I'm sure we're kind of talked about this during kind
4437960	4442800	of what we're playing this week. But yes in case you haven't heard and you happen to have
4442800	4450260	bought a 3DS early on you're one of the early adopters if you will. You are of course going
4450260	4456280	to get some more games as part of the ambassadors program. You'll be getting 10 free Gameboy
4456280	4462120	Advance games as well and this is kind of cool. Some actually really good games in there
4462120	4467120	which I was very pleasantly surprised to see. They include Super Mario Advance 3 Yoshi's
4467120	4474600	Island, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare Mega Micro Games, Mario
4474600	4480080	vs Donkey Kong, Wario Land 4, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, The Sacred Stones,
4480080	4485140	The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, and F-Zero Maximum Velocity. Some of those games actually
4485140	4489880	I recently sold with one of my old DS's. I gotta say some of those games haven't aged
4489880	4494760	too well either. Because I played the Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero which I love
4494760	4501400	the F-Zero on the GameCube but yeah the F-Zero on Gameboy Advance I guess wasn't that good
4501400	4505240	or one of those things you kind of remember more fondly 10 years ago. These games aren't
4505240	4509080	that old but still they're kind of showing their age a little bit. Especially the Mario
4509080	4512960	Kart. Like it's hard to go from playing Mario Kart 7 on your 3DS to going to play Mario
4512960	4516680	Kart Super Circuit because it's like why am I not able to get the nitro boost when I do
4516680	4521200	the turn or you know some of that. So it controls really funky too compared to 7. And I gotta
4521200	4527360	say Mario Kart 7 man that's a good looking game. I mean the screenshots don't do it justice
4527360	4533680	at all or even the gameplay video doesn't do it justice. But man it's just really crisp.
4533680	4540520	But some of the other like Gameboy Advance like Metroid is great. WarioWare is amazing.
4540520	4544360	You know there's a lot of great. You know the best. Even though it's not in the bundle
4544360	4549000	it's still the best. River City Ransom. What on Gameboy Advance? That's right. Heck yeah
4549000	4552980	it was really good. But that's not a first party Nintendo game. That's the one thing
4552980	4556460	all these games have in common. No but I'm saying that it's a game that has aged well.
4556460	4561100	And hello Yoshi's Super Mario 2 Yoshi's Island which yes I realize is whatever they redid
4561100	4565600	it as for the Gameboy Advance but still that's an amazing game. And then also one thing I
4565600	4570600	read is kind of a little tip because I know the Gameboy Advance stuff gets stretched out
4570600	4574380	when you play it. You can actually hold start or select while you're starting the game up
4574380	4578660	and it will shrink it down. Yeah funny enough Kijuno in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com
4578660	4582800	says Rob did you play the Gameboy Advance games in small window mode? Yeah I actually
4582800	4586920	didn't like it. I just I didn't mind the stretched images. Especially for like WarioWare. It
4586920	4591220	doesn't matter. Those games weren't like cutting edge graphics. But I can see where the stretch
4591220	4595400	gets kind of yucky on some of the other games. So I get why you can do that. But it's too
4595400	4600120	small. Windows too small when you do it that way. Zether in our chatroom is saying you
4600120	4604780	know the Gameboy Advance F-Zero is more of a throwback to the SNES games. I thought the
4604780	4608600	SNES games control better. I will say though it is interesting to play those games with
4608600	4614520	the circle pad. Because it works. I mean you know. But we didn't have like a circle pad
4614520	4620560	on the Gameboy Advance so it's kind of neat to have that. Yeah. So. Alright. Alright Dark
4620560	4626120	Sakura what do you have for us? Well I have some more stuff. This actually has to do with
4626120	4634760	Ultima Online 2. There was apparently something said by Richard Garriott who was looking to
4634760	4640460	talk to EA about publishing a new Ultima Online. He said that they would they would love to
4640460	4648800	have access to the Ultima property and had discussions with EA about it. But EA apparently
4648800	4653960	is not down for that. They've said no we're not. What's he talking about? In fact the
4653960	4658040	quote actually says I'm not sure what Richard Garriott is referring to. So it doesn't look
4658040	4665000	like that might actually be happening. Maybe he's feeling a little bit sorrowful that you
4665000	4669120	know Tabula Rasa didn't work out the space thing. Maybe. Not really doing that now but.
4669120	4677760	But there is something about an Ultimate Collector project that does start with Ultima. Hmm.
4677760	4684400	Maybe no. Ultima was a great series though. I would like to see it make a comeback in
4684400	4687560	some form or another. I know they have the web game I think was the last big thing I
4687560	4692280	saw them doing. But some people are still freaking playing Ultima Online. They gave
4692280	4696000	it they gave it a big redesign a few years ago to kind of make it a little more current.
4696000	4701960	So it's kind of cool. Let's see. Alright let's travel around the world and look at some release
4701960	4705920	dates and check out what's coming out to an arcade or excuse me a home console. I wish
4705920	4712400	it was a tradition arcade but to a console near you soon. Well probably not a lot right.
4712400	4718400	Yeah. I hope you like Star Wars The Old Republic because that's all that's coming out this
4718400	4727760	week on PC. Nice. That's it. Alright. It's pretty good. Let's go to Japan and check out
4727760	4731280	what's coming out there. Now I do want to point out the Vita is out in Japan. That was
4731280	4736080	one of the big releases of this past week. And of course you see a lot of the unboxing videos
4736080	4740400	and a lot of stuff. I thought about importing it until I saw the six hundred dollar for
4740400	4746640	just the console thing. Oh my God. Like a hundred bucks each. No thank you. All right.
4746640	4751120	Things are a little more exciting in Japan than just one game this week on the Xbox 360
4751120	4756720	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 gets a dubbed version for Japanese release this week. Divinity
4756720	4762960	2 The Dragon Knight Saga and Musou Orochi 2 comes in a regular and treasure box edition
4762960	4769920	from Koei Tecmo comes out this week on the Xbox 360. That's a is this a fighting game.
4769920	4773440	I think this is a fighting series. Oh yeah it's a fighting series from Koei. It's probably
4773440	4781840	like a Dynasty Warriors universe fighter. Orochi has to do with a legend an old legend.
4781840	4789680	What was that was it Orochi? Yeah. Musou. Yeah. I think it might be all that stuff.
4790880	4796400	On the PlayStation 3 pretty much the same games I just mentioned Modern Warfare 3 Musou Orochi 2
4796400	4805360	a couple extra games there though. Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011. Need for Speed Hot
4805360	4810080	Pursuit gets a price reduction and next week in Japan I got to get this out there because we're
4810080	4817280	not going to be here next week. The Idolmaster Graver For You Volume 3 comes out next week. I
4817280	4822720	know The Idolmaster is like a really big series over in Japan. Going to some of the other consoles
4822720	4829520	I want to check out at least like the Wii and the Vita. Nothing really on the Wii that I can see.
4830800	4834800	Oh wait I was looking at the Wii U no wonder I don't see anything there. My name my brain
4834800	4842720	combined them into the WETA. On the Wii Inazuma Eleven Strikers 2012 Extreme. That's the lone
4842720	4848480	Wii release this week and let's see if there's anything on the 3DS or the Vita. Any late starts
4848480	4854000	out the gate. Oh yeah Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3. Oh that's a general Asia region release
4854640	4862880	comes out this week and quickly let me look on the 3DS. There is a looks like there's a branded
4862880	4869520	Nintendo 3S a Gundam 3DS. Oh no the SD card it's just the SD cards. Oh no no this is the full 3DS.
4869520	4874400	Are they SD Gundam cards? Yeah yeah like they're SD cards little Gundam characters and then they
4874400	4880880	actually have a 3DS that has. That makes it funny because they're SD Gundams. It was a series SD
4880880	4888000	Gundam. I gotcha. Well there is a game also to go with it SD Gundam G generation 3D is out this week.
4888000	4895040	SD Gundams are so cute. All right there you go that's your Japanese releases. The UK um on the 20th
4895040	4901760	Star Wars The Old Republic um and the 21st Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD on PS3. That's it.
4903440	4908720	Pretty quick series of release dates yep. That's what happens this time of year. All right Loki.
4908720	4916400	All right um man it's always dead this time of year but thankfully though it won't be dead to
4916400	4923200	along in um first quarter of next year. Nintendo has announced their upcoming release list uh for
4923200	4929120	their you know titles um hitting the Wii and 3DS and of course on Nintendo DS as well.
4929120	4935200	Some notable stuff um Kid Icarus Uprising getting a date finally. It's going to be coming out
4935200	4944720	in March and uh I love how this isn't working. March 23rd um so that's pretty cool. Wish it was
4944720	4950640	coming out earlier than that but whatever I'll wait. Um other notable stuff Mario Kart I'm sorry
4950640	4958240	Mario Party 9 on the Wii coming out March 11th. Also Poke Park 2 Wonders Beyond on February 27th
4958240	4965680	also on the Wii. Uh let's see some other stuff. They're also going to be getting um some cool
4965680	4972800	eShop stuff. VVVVV um for the 3DS will be coming out first quarter next year as well as Night Sky
4972800	4981200	and uh Mighty Switch Force Zen Pit Ball and Mutant Mudds and I guess uh Kirby's Block Ball
4981200	4986240	is going to be brought to the Virtual Console as well for the 3DS. Um they're going to be
4986240	4993520	coming out for the 3DS. Um on uh WiiWare La Mulana is supposed to be coming out. That's pretty cool.
4994320	4999520	And then uh someone tell DT to keep it in his pants. Yeah he's already well aware of La Mulana
4999520	5007280	coming out. Nice. He's he's on the pulse of La Mulana. Um Rhythm Heaven Fever that's coming out
5007280	5015360	February 13th on the Wii. That's also going to be $29.99. So uh you're a nice budget price for that
5015360	5021040	honestly never got into those. But uh and then of course the Circle Pad Pro will be coming out
5021040	5026080	around that time. All right well before we get to the classic game of the week I gotta share this
5026080	5030320	story that's going around the internet this week making its way on the gaming blogs. Uh a very
5030320	5035680	interesting censorship issue going on on the Nintendo 3DS. Imagine if you were Ashton Kutcher
5036400	5044080	and you tried to name your Mii on your 3DS Ashton. Uh Nintendo apparently is censoring that name
5044080	5050240	believing that it contains objectionable content. Because think about it Ashton if you spell it out
5050240	5057600	A S H. Yeah it sounds like a shit ton or um ass ton maybe. I don't know but this. So if you like
5057600	5062160	Aston Martin's you can't have one? I guess not. So this poor guy named Ashton I mean it's not
5062160	5066320	Ashton Kutcher obviously but that's you know a common use of the name or we would think like
5066320	5069440	oh there are people named this in the world. Because if it was Ashton Kutcher that shit would
5069440	5078000	be fixed. Maybe done. But somebody who also has the name Ashton uh tried to set up he named his
5078000	5084560	Mii that and he named his um uh the Mii creator that and it got censored. And he actually shows
5084560	5089120	there's a whole YouTube video and you can see the YouTube for yourself it's posted there. Uh
5089120	5097360	it is on user L E Y V I U R. Leave your? Take it or leave your? Uh so you can see this and he
5097360	5101440	actually shows his Mii and then he shows what it looks like on his friend's system where it's
5101440	5106720	replaced it with a bunch of question marks because apparently the name Ashton is objectionable. Now
5106720	5110800	Ashton Kutcher I find objectionable but this poor guy who just happens to have the same name
5110800	5118240	shouldn't have to suffer the consequence of Ashton Kutcher being crappy. So.
5120480	5124240	Man wouldn't you hate to find out that Nintendo just suddenly deemed your name offensive?
5124240	5129920	It's stupid. I'm offended by Rob. Yeah I feel like you're gonna steal from me. It's like you're
5129920	5136560	gonna rob a bank or something. Hey well it's good though that they was it for the 3DS they've
5136560	5144400	patched it so that they can add DLC right? So does that mean they're gonna be able to bug fix stuff
5144400	5147920	like this? Well I suppose they could get firmware updates. They could do that in a firmware update.
5147920	5152080	That firmware update really did kind of you know it was like they changed everything in that
5152080	5157440	console. I mean they they overwrote some of the stuff in the the find me thing. They overwrote
5158240	5162560	it was a lot of changes so they can they could they could fix it if they want. I know they can.
5163360	5169040	But they're not. No not unless Ashton Kutcher tweets about it. So somebody should send him
5169040	5173440	that YouTube. But they could do it though because remember there's issues with Street Fighter where
5173440	5177760	it wasn't working correctly or Ridge Racer or something like that. One of the launch titles
5177760	5187200	was like bugged or something. Yeah so they fixed that. It's sad that you know because we're gonna
5187200	5194080	get into a story later on but it's sad that that Nintendo hasn't embraced the ability to
5195200	5204160	patch games. Right? Stupid. Yeah all right let's uh let's take a look at the classic game of the
5204160	5212000	week. I thought of it in my car. Every week we take a stroll down memory lane because you know
5212000	5217280	at one one day you didn't have these 3DSs that were banning people's names. You used to just
5218400	5223760	one day actually in tonight's case you used to walk into an arcade and there actually were
5223760	5230240	arcade games there and not like machines that spat tickets out. Right. So you have to recognize
5230240	5234160	the classic games in the past the way things used to be. You better recognize. You better recognize or
5234160	5239680	a recognizer will force you to play games. All right so you have to play Space Paranoids over
5239680	5244880	and over. Dark Soccer enough set up. What is tonight's classic game of the week? Xavius.
5247280	5252960	It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Namco and it came out in 1982. You know what else came out in
5252960	5261840	1982 Rob? What? Tron. Awesome. Yeah it was a game done by Masanobu Endo and uh it was released by
5261840	5268080	Atari in the US and it runs on the Galaga hardware. But I just have to say I find the um background
5268080	5274640	music on this to actually get kind of annoying. I might have to kill it at some point. The um in
5274640	5278480	Brazil the cabinet actually says Colombia for the game but the software still says Xavius.
5278480	5286160	So um you use um an uh eight directional joystick to move an aircraft called the Silvelo which has
5286160	5291920	a forward firing zapper and a blaster that lets you send the air to surface bombs down for ground
5291920	5299440	targets. And it's supposed to be set in Peru. So you have to basically just fly around and shoot
5299440	5308880	shit. It's a shmup. You have 16 areas and it loops back to area 7 after 16 and uh you just keep going
5308880	5317360	over terrain and shooting shit. So if you complete at least 70% of the area before dying then um like
5317360	5323200	when you die then you actually will start at the next level instead. It constantly flies forward
5323200	5329680	just like any good shmup. Um you actually can make it through the whole game without killing anybody
5329680	5336400	for the record. Although not really. Where's the fun in that? I know right? The challenge is not
5336400	5344720	getting hit. Um it is one of the very I would have to put it in the first of the uh uh shmups.
5344720	5351920	It actually one of an earlier one before that was Caverns of Mars on uh the uh Atari computer.
5351920	5360240	Um it was really really cool. It uses a lot of different um uh techniques for it. It uses palette
5360240	5370640	shifting for color changes and it's just really amazing. Um they also had a uh a few hidden bonuses
5370640	5375920	in it that you could find by doing a secret maneuver. Um one of them was a special flag from
5375920	5382640	Rally X. And what happens if you find the flag then you um get an extra life. It's in a bunch of
5382640	5392160	Namco games. Um and the slogan when this came out was are you devious enough to play Xevious?
5392160	5398320	Oh and then it says the arcade game you can't play at home. I'm gonna play some of the music from the
5398320	5406320	I'm gonna play some of the music from the um the the newer the newer one. Well
5408800	5415360	actually there were um pretty big uh music stars in Japan who were big fans of the games. And uh
5416480	5424240	one of them who was Keisuke Kawata um of Southern All-Stars actually did an album uh that was all
5424240	5432080	based off of Namco video games and Xevious was the centerpiece one. And then um there was also
5432080	5438720	a 12-inch single that had uh liner notes and a science fiction story written by um the creator
5438720	5445920	um Masa no Blendo uh that had uh it was set in the world of Xevious and had its own language
5445920	5455520	included. Um there was also a three-part novel written about it called uh Fairdraw F-A-R-D-R-A-U-T
5456400	5461520	um but the theory is that it doesn't sound like it was ever released or if it was released it
5461520	5467200	was really limited release. There were other games that came out in the series. In 84 it was Super
5467200	5476160	Xevious that was basically the same game just harder and uh Sylvilo in 1991 which was first
5476160	5482880	person sort of it uses 3D flat shaded polygons and they only came out in Japan. Xevious 3D-G um
5482880	5490960	in 1995 was basically a 3D textured um on top of polygons and two-player play only in Japan although
5490960	5498000	I've seen one. Xevious Arrangement in 1995 that was part of the Namco Classic Volume 1 collection
5498000	5504480	also included Xevious and Super Xevious. Um Grubda which was a spin-off starring an enemy
5504480	5512320	a tank with corkscrew treads that came out in 84. Also um new versions for the home system was
5512320	5518880	Super Veevious Gamp no Nazo in 1986 which came out for uh the Famicom and the Nintendo Vs.
5518880	5526720	I'm sorry why is that versus series um in the arcades. Uh basically there's different riddles
5526720	5532480	you have to solve to get through it. Um there was Xevious Fardrop Saga which was um an MSX2 game
5532480	5537680	and it was done by Compile. Compile does amazing stuff. You can actually uh pick from four
5537680	5542720	different ships you have the Sylvilo, the Solgrado, the Zeodally and the Gamp Mission.
5542720	5549760	There's uh Xevious Fardrop Densetsu in 1990 that came out on PC Engine also done by Compile.
5550320	5556800	And then Xevious Resurrection that came out in 2009 for PS3 as a downloadable um with the
5556800	5563920	downloadable title Namco Museum Essentials or it was called namcomuseum.com to the ends in Japan.
5564480	5568880	There's also an RTS game called New Space Order that was done by Namco Bandai Games
5568880	5574800	that has bits of Xevious included in it. For different ports we're looking at the Atari 7800
5574800	5583360	Atari um 8-bit NEC PC Engine, the NES, the MSX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II,
5583360	5589840	Apple ST Home Computer. Everything. Yep. Rereleases like I said there was Namco Museum Volume 2 for
5589840	5599040	the Playstation which I have the A. Um the Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade PC 1998, Namco Museum 50th
5599040	5604720	Anniversary for Xbox, PS2, GameCube. That one's pretty sweet actually. I like that one. And PC.
5605440	5613040	Um it was not in the Game Boy Advance version by the way. Uh Namco Museum Battle Collection for PSP,
5613040	5619200	Namco Museum DS, Namco Museum Remix on Wii, Namco Museum Essentials for PS3. Like I said earlier
5619200	5626640	and it was also ported into the plug-and-play um version of Ms. Pac-Man TV compilation for a little
5626640	5638720	plug-in thing. Um there was also um a uh GBA um release of the NES version on um it was an
5638720	5644960	unlockable bonus game for Star Fox Assault and then came out on Virtual Console. Uh like I said
5644960	5650080	there's just a bunch of them. They tried to do a 2600 version it didn't come out. It was part of
5650080	5658800	Pac-Man's arcade party in 2010 and uh 3D classic Xevious a 3D uh remake of the game was available
5658800	5667040	on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS. There's a bootleg version too called Xevious. X-E-V-I-O-S.
5667040	5677440	The U is absent. Oh that makes it a new game. Um but really it's just all they did was instead of
5677440	5690080	saying uh 1982 Namco it says 1980 Watson and they removed the Namco logo and it's just not very cool.
5690080	5699280	In fact um there's a trick that was in Xevious um that the bootlegger left in that you um get
5699280	5703600	a message right at the beginning. When the ship appears you move to the far right edge of the
5703600	5708800	screen and begin bombing constantly. You keep bombing until the first set of attack rings is
5708800	5714560	close to you then you shoot the rings. The message dead copy making copy under Namco program will
5714560	5720080	appear on the screen as proof of copyright validation and the explosion sounds are different.
5720080	5725680	As far as differences in the U.S. and Japanese ones um the names in the Japanese version are
5725680	5732960	the pseudonyms of the games designers and composers and since uh the U.S. basically let three uh
5732960	5738000	characters in it didn't work and the zapper and blaster buttons were reversed between the versions.
5738000	5745120	There's also references in Ridge Racer you get a car called the um RTXevious Red and the RTXevious
5745120	5752320	Green uh you get that all three different versions of it and uh one of the in Ridge Racer 3D one of
5752320	5758400	the unlockable cars is called the Sovalo and it's piloted by Pac-Man. Isn't that cool? Very cool.
5758400	5763760	How about other references? Good lord there's a lot to this game. Oh yeah we're we're just scratching
5763760	5769360	we're just scratching the surface in Star Fox. Come on we're getting ready to start Mario Kart. In Star Fox
5769360	5776960	Assault it's uh it has basically hidden versions in it. Tales of Symphonia there's an enemy called
5776960	5783600	Bakura which is one of the invisible flying panels from Xevious. Mario Kart Arcade GP and GP2 which
5783600	5793200	were co-developed by Namco. Um you also uh one of Pac-Man's uh cars is the Sovalo spacecraft.
5793200	5801200	In Earthbound music from Xevious can be heard um at the Onet Arcade. Um you can actually get
5801200	5808320	the Sovalo ship um as an avatar on PSN and it will be a downloadable aircraft in Ace Combat
5808320	5816960	Assault Horizon. There you go. Your classic game of the week Xevious and its 50 gazillion different
5816960	5822320	ports and reiterations. I like this one I'm looking I've never played this one the 3D-G.
5822320	5826800	Yeah I never played that one but it looks kind of fun I gotta say. You know what when I told um Dan
5826800	5832240	what I picked he's like Xevious is awesome. It is awesome. The other game that I picked though he
5832240	5839600	was really excited about that so I might have to do it uh next time. All right well uh we're gonna
5839600	5843920	take a break we're gonna do Mario Kart again we are uh getting in the oil army room right now
5843920	5847920	there's already five of us in there including myself and Loki and Bobby Black Wolf so it's
5847920	5854560	really it's on it's kind of and Tiger Claw so it's really like All Games versus Zether who won
5854560	5861040	last time so it's not looking good. Everyone's got a team All Games has each other's back dude
5861040	5865440	you are in trouble. That's right you are screwed. They're gonna use a special turtle shell that just
5865440	5869600	breaks out of paddle and spanks you. Does Zether have a shell maybe he does and I just I'm not
5869600	5874000	aware who knows. All right anyhow uh so if you have Mario Kart 7 hurry up and get in there in

6361680	6365760	interesting because uh i thought the game was originally supposed to be on both and then they
6365760	6370880	said no it's not going to be on the pc well now it is actually coming on the pc both download
6370880	6376240	content the rider and the signal they're going to be included in the pc version for free possibly to
6376240	6381120	make up for a little bit of lost time uh interestingly enough this is time to be right
6381120	6385920	around the time that the allen wake xbox live arcade game or allen wakes american nightmare
6385920	6389840	is supposed to be coming out on xbox live arcade so kind of maybe trying to get the name out there
6389840	6396000	a little bit again before the xbox live arcade expansion uh connectimals i find this interesting
6396000	6400560	you know this is one of the big titles on connect well connectimals has come out on another platform
6400560	6408320	on another platform it's coming out on ios i think that's i think this is very interesting um maybe
6408320	6412800	something we should talk about in a more extended segment but uh connectimals is coming out on the
6412800	6419360	ios platforms this is just a port of the windows phone 7 version but it still goes without saying
6419360	6425200	hey microsoft didn't just put out the xbox live application on ios this is now extending to some
6425200	6431680	of the games and sure connectimals is meh whatever but for two dollars and ninety nine cents you can
6431680	6438000	now i get this and it comes with i guess five cubs for the 360 games i guess you gotta link them
6438000	6444160	together somehow or whatever so very interesting also you know why i think this is interesting is
6444160	6448720	because there's been a lot of calls for nintendo to do something like this right the investors
6448720	6453760	really want nintendo to be doing this and they've really staunchly refused but microsoft has now
6453760	6458320	shown that they're not afraid to do it now granted they get a little more out of it with the whole
6458320	6464080	windows phone tie in but i mean they put it out there it's kind of like they acknowledged hey
6464080	6468160	if we don't put that on ios too we're selling ourselves short a little bit they kind of gave
6468160	6473200	windows phone an exclusive window they put it out there first but they kind of gave in and did the
6473200	6479040	ios system i just it's not like microsoft and apple doing things together is completely unheard
6479040	6484000	of right remember the gasps heard around the world when microsoft word was announced for the
6484000	6489040	max that was years and years ago when steve jobs first came back to apple but um it's still
6489040	6493040	interesting nonetheless very interesting to see this happening be curious to see if sony or
6493040	6499440	nintendo ever does anything in a similar vein anyhow moving on dark sakura wow i found pictures
6499440	6505200	of me when i was four okay oh i was a cute kid damn it it's still cute what happened
6505200	6513280	don't make me throw my microphone at your ass since you're facing the computer so there's
6513280	6520160	going to be a lego lord of the rings no one curr hey i curr all right maybe not and there's going
6520160	6528240	to be toys next year now that's cooler yeah you know what i want a lego palace this makes me happy
6528240	6536720	sonic cd on xbox live yay it'll be five bucks rock of ages going half price major nelson said
6536720	6542400	all of this and i believe major nelson also the awesome thing about the sonic cd is it will have
6542960	6550640	both soundtracks we will have the japanese as well as the american soundtrack trying to will be on
6550640	6558240	xbox live arcade on december 21st for 15 bucks also there will be the deal of the week including
6558240	6565200	japan's finest which is hardcore uprising and radiant silver gun for 750 each bangai ohd
6565200	6571360	missile fury and gun wage are five dollars apiece and rock of ages is down to five bucks as well
6571920	6578720	everyone needs to get sonic cd and radiant silver gun yay sales i love the japanese soundtrack
6578720	6584880	i love the japanese soundtrack for sonic cd so much but then again just not the same without
6584880	6593040	sonic boom and oh yeah there was other news shit sorry i was all you know excited over
6593040	6600480	sonic sales and stuff there's a new pokemon game that's a crossover with nobunaga's ambition what
6600480	6610400	yeah it's true when i think about pokemon i think about nobunaga's ambition so do i um i always
6610400	6616400	wondered when these two games go great together make the pikachus go out there's a website to
6616400	6625280	feed the troops and a trailer and it's set for 2012 release on the nintendo ds in japan and uh

6633360	6638160	where's our new real pokemon game i want pokemon fuchsia or whatever meanwhile the rest of the
6638160	6639840	universe shits their collective pants
6642320	6646880	all right is that it that's it all right uh all right we're gonna get back into some long form
6646880	6652240	news here with loki pretty soon guys the twitter topics i want to plug those twitter.com get in
6652240	6656400	your twitter topics we'll be getting to those in a little bit as well as the skype line one eights

6660000	6665600	game olr uh a little later in the show first off though loki you know i was gonna mention uh
6665600	6670320	remember earlier i said that i don't like people sending me invites or i'm not gonna accept any
6670320	6676160	invites that people send me for the sim social when the fuck this in aol instant messenger start
6676160	6681280	like posting on your fucking facebook wall saying i've been idle since blah blah blah time
6681280	6687360	blah blah time i don't fucking care if you haven't been doing something in another app so hide all
6687360	6692880	that i hate that it's posting like what's news articles my friends are reading i'm kind of like
6692880	6698160	on yahoo my friends know that i can tell like that they're reading all these weird stories like
6698160	6701280	maybe they're reading a few too many stories about lindsey low hand you know and i'm kind
6701280	6705360	of judging them a little bit well i i want to make sure that shit's not happening just
6705360	6709040	acts like you don't realize it's happening you know what i mean you got to be careful uh go
6709040	6712960	through every now and then and check like what apps have access honestly it's what you got to do
6712960	6718800	yeah all right um anyways so let's talk a little bit about uh club nintendo and this is kind of
6718800	6724240	cool because actually i've never really registered stuff in club nintendo and i started yesterday so
6724240	6728640	i had a bunch of these old games i just went back through you know like excite bots and shit like
6728640	6735120	that so i just added almost everything although i can't find my box for my 3ds um and definitely
6735120	6739760	don't have anything well the we would have been too early but don't have my 3ds box which is kind
6739760	6745600	of sad because i'm missing some points there might be a work but um you can use those points for
6745600	6751680	other things other than buying useless garbage that they have on their e-shop stuff um hold on
6751680	6756080	there's necessarily e-shop but you know the free shit they give away i don't really need a mario
6756080	6763040	notepad or something like that but uh you can buy uh games virtual console and we wear and e-shop
6763040	6771840	games including uh this first round of games all um either 100 or 150 coins for 100 coins on the
6771840	6777600	we you can get mario super mario kart on virtual console and this is only good until january 10th
6777600	6784480	so if you want to use that then go ahead and do that if you don't have the game um for the uh we
6784480	6794480	wear you have fluosity and uh that's 150 coins on the 3ds or ds i believe it's a 3ds you have um
6795840	6805600	the 3d classic xevious for 100 coins or mario versus donkey kong minis march again for 150 coins
6805600	6814720	and um it's neat but yeah there's not really i was kind of disappointed at the rewards it's
6814720	6818080	an interesting way to get you to spend some of those coins well you know like you can get some
6818080	6824400	pretty meaty things for more coins like there's the game and watch ds game and we we got a statue
6824400	6829760	yeah from club nintendo did you that's um like all the major mario characters that's cool
6829760	6833360	and the little statue i don't think my level is high enough to get any of the really cool rewards
6833360	6837360	but i've been trying to put like i put in my code for the to have in 3ds and getting the two games
6837360	6844000	i got because i i thought i heard something about the kid icarus 3d will be free if you register two
6844000	6849520	games on club nintendo this winner well i've already done that so yeah me too so i want to
6849520	6853760	make sure i would get that between mario kart 7 and and the mario kart 3d land so i'm kind of
6853760	6857440	disappointed though that you can't and and here's the other thing i don't like about the registering
6857440	6861520	the games yeah it's cool that we register the games but i don't like fucking filling out that
6861520	6865840	survey yeah it's kind of like especially you should notice how you get a damn survey for
6865840	6870080	each and every like stinking like nes game and probably now the game boy advance games are all
6870080	6874640	gonna have a survey on there too i kind of think it's no i i haven't seen surveys for any nes games
6874640	6878240	they want to make sure that they're still releasing stuff of good quality so do you get
6878240	6883200	coins for buying like stuff on the e-shop um yeah if you do the survey on them i think you do i
6883200	6887280	didn't have any surveys well i haven't purchased anything on the e-shop yeah check it out once you
6887280	6892160	do i think i think they do get get some stuff there so it'll be cool i got surveys for the free
6892160	6898800	shit by the way the information is up on our tumblr now the link to the uh pokemon plus
6898800	6903600	nobunaga's ambition i love that jigglypuff's on the cover like she's gonna sing the armies to
6903600	6910480	sleep what is okay what is looking like to me okay from what i can tell is that every human
6910480	6916080	character has a pokemon partner i guess they're doing like digimon like this one guy in purple
6916080	6922960	armor has a mewtwo and the girl she's all in pink she has jigglypuff and this one's got okay so you
6922960	6928240	see and then i think whoever he is is the guy catching them i'd be more interested in the dynasty
6928240	6935440	warriors mario crossover fucking we need to know armies of goombas with you know we need to do a
6935440	6938400	list list so i didn't schedule one tonight because i knew we had the interview it would take about
6938400	6941520	a bunch of time but we need to do list list some night like crossover emotions yeah i feel like
6941520	6946000	we've done that before random japanese crime it has to be japanese franchise random ass japanese
6946000	6950000	crossover game we want to see i think that would be a good one dude we have time for that anyway
6950000	6955200	no not tonight we still had you after birth and all that so we're that interview was 20 minutes so
6955200	6963280	anyhow um moving on that was 20 minutes shut up shut up well uh you'll lose a lot more than 20
6963280	6968080	minutes if you hit this bug here um did you hear about this there's that zelda skyward sword
6968080	6974080	apparently you could catch yourself in some type of like error where if you complete a quest in
6974080	6979760	the wrong order and then talk to a guy you can like screw things up i don't know but apparently
6979760	6985280	nintendo on the support page for legend of zelda skyward sword says you can actually send in your
6985280	6991840	save file to be fixed nintendo apparently will also be putting out a program that will repair
6991840	6997520	the save data if you have your we connected to the internet so it's like a patch but not really
6998160	7001440	so yeah i guess you could catch yourself in some type of because they can't patch
7001440	7006880	yeah they can't patch but they're going to put out some type of fix so there you go you could
7006880	7011920	also you could send in your safe you could send in your we and get your game fixed fuck if you
7011920	7019200	screwed up so just i would read the internet and figure out what you need to do to not screw it up
7019760	7023200	or don't try to break the game because i think you kind of have to go backwards a little bit
7023200	7028960	to make this happen so i don't know all right we're going to now see if anybody can break our
7028960	7035920	mailbag mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is the place to send us emails every week
7037360	7043760	dark soccer read some emails we have two two yeah that's a pathetic showing of emails well
7043760	7049040	one's from rob all right well he's pretty cool he says i got my answer from the consumer protection
7049600	7054720	um they said they can't give legal advice even though they are under an attorney general's
7054720	7059200	office then again i didn't ask for legal advice simply information their answer seems to say that
7059200	7065600	this is not codified in law in maryland my advice for these nasty eulas is if you feel the need to
7065600	7071200	sue microsoft or sony is to first try the arbitration then dispute it if the settlement
7071200	7078080	is unfair i think you just got a form letter back dude that's the form letter okay last email
7078080	7087200	sorry hey olr crew so i hate to be the guy that sends you yet another silly youtube link okay
7087200	7092720	rob get ready to pull it up but i found this to be worthy of a quick watch maybe my sense of humor
7092720	7097600	is completely sick and perverse but i'll be damned if the kids in skyrim aren't annoying
7097600	7102880	little bastards every now and then this just proves every now and then every is this another
7102880	7107440	goddamn arrow to the knee clip i don't know this just proves i'm not alone i think loki in
7107440	7111680	particular will get a kick out of this okay i'm linking it to hold on i got it i got it is it from
7112480	7116960	okay i see it here we go it's probably the killing children mod or something all right here we go it's
7116960	7123360	called yep killable children is what it's called so let's see here ew it's playing an ad i don't
7123360	7133040	watch no ad with ugly people all right hold on add add add well grandma was a hottie.com
7133040	7137360	yes that's what the ad was for now you know the type of stuff i watch on youtube okay here's the
7137360	7139360	real clip
7147920	7154080	you shouldn't talk to strangers this kid gutted with a fire sword oh look i just
7154080	7170720	i just killed a little friend here look at this oh my god that's terrible that's awesome
7170720	7175920	i've seen this video before run away from me he just i didn't even know you could decapitate
7175920	7182720	people ah you rush the dragon i stay i kind of want to go back and play skyrim again and
7182720	7191600	just kill everybody be careful agony i keep hands on the ground wow yes sorry in all seriousness
7191600	7197200	though i'm a huge fan of the show and have been listening for over six years i listen on and off
7197200	7201760	throughout the week while working and you three managed to put a smile on my face no matter what
7201760	7208880	the topic is even if we talk about child killing unicorn stabbing decapitating their mothers face
7208880	7215760	melting yes i wanted to ask you how you have kept the show going on for so many years alcohol
7218320	7224480	i have known countless groups bands organizations etc that start off strong but lose steam and
7224480	7229680	eventually die due to apathy how do you guys manage to push through and deliver week after
7231120	7236400	week after week after a whopping nine years what keeps you motivated and do you guys ever have
7236400	7241840	major disagreements or even fights regarding direction no never you want to see the show go
7241840	7247440	in the future just want to see behind the scenes gossip for a rabid olr fanboy take care and happy
7247440	7256720	holidays tonic vision um first of all i'm never the same person every day so it's because of my
7256720	7262400	innate womanness that i will change personality all the time you never know which pokemon she's
7262400	7269200	carrying around um robin i go to disneyland that helps i i don't know that's i i i honestly don't
7269200	7273840	know how we've managed to do this for nine years but you know we we we had a pretty good skit it's
7273840	7278560	funny you're asking this now because we had a pretty good scare this past week that it might
7278560	7282800	end very suddenly there there was a realistic possibility for a minute there that this could
7282800	7287280	have been the last i was still gonna try the skype thing no wouldn't have been the last or a lot i
7287280	7294480	know i know i know but the last olr as we know it you know and i i have my issues with the skype
7294480	7299520	thing i know horde house kind of does it but you know just this show is good enough for horde house
7300160	7305120	this show has worked because we haven't changed a lot since the first day and i think are you
7305120	7312240	shitting me we've changed quite a bit but we've had nine fucking years to change we've evolved
7312240	7317520	yes evolution we've evolved into raichu at some point along the way but no really i mean you know
7317520	7323840	i thought we were jolting on we slowly evolved into the whole uh um you know general video
7323840	7328240	gaming when we used to be about ddr and it was a lot more i found that the show had absolutely
7328240	7332880	no fucking structure back in the day like if you listen if you listen to early episodes migraine
7332880	7337680	the first episode and was like asleep in that chair if you listen to the first few episodes
7337680	7340720	we really would just be like we're just gonna kind of like fuck off for three hours and talk
7340720	7346480	about topics because you know to as much as i hate inflating travis's ego on this show
7346480	7350880	that's kind of how i learned to do it on understation live is we kind of like had that
7350880	7355200	same approach or it was like well we know we're going to talk about xyz tonight and somehow we'll
7355200	7360000	do a show and it it were i'm not knocking travis at all he does a beautiful show and that's iron
7360000	7366960	finger yeah that's that's how i was raised so to speak but at some point along the way when we made
7366960	7373840	the switch into podcasting like i think suddenly when we took a different approach in making the
7373840	7379840	to-go edition and then suddenly it was like okay we've gone from having 50 people listen live
7379840	7386560	to having 2500 people downloading our podcast it was like shit something's working over here maybe
7386560	7391520	we should like try mixing it up a little bit and it's it's kind of worked having the structure
7391520	7396800	hasn't been such a bad thing but yes there's structure but there's still huge amounts of
7396800	7401040	spontaneity yeah and a lot of that is directed by you guys in the chat room and i hate to sound
7401040	7407360	mushy yucky frilly fuzzy but it's my foot in the trash the chatters to a big extent and our live
7407360	7414880	audience and the interaction that we do get on the show me is sure is hugely motivating i mean
7414880	7420640	for real like i i will be flat out dead honest there was i can think of one night in particular
7420640	7425600	when i was ready to walk in here and say i'm quit i'm done i can't do this show anymore one dude
7425600	7432080	but well no that was a different time but there was another time where i i just and i couldn't
7432080	7436560	even tell you exactly when it was it was a long it was a long time ago it was it was during the
7436560	7442240	garage years i remember that and um it was like one of the see it was probably around that same
7442240	7446160	time when remember the computer went down yeah mid show and i had the big diva fit i think not
7446160	7453360	long after that i was ready to just fucking quit and within a short time of each other we had the
7453360	7459680	listeners chip together to buy a new computer and i got not one but like two emails that were very
7459680	7465520	kind of personal in nature about like you know just what i've kind of put out there on the
7465520	7469200	internet being like kind of open about the fact that i'm gay and you know in a relationship and
7469200	7473200	all that stuff and and that it kind of gave some people that were struggling with coming out
7473200	7478160	like hope and that like means like so much like i was just like floored and i was kind of like
7478160	7484160	i fucking can't leave yeah i'm in this too deep now that they keep bribing us with food
7485040	7491920	and games and happy things inevitably it'll it'll have to end someday nothing good lasts forever but
7493600	7498800	what else am i going to do on sunday nights i i'm serious about lots of alcohol no i'm
7498800	7504800	kidding it's it's seriously become like a part of my life like it's it's it's my routine like
7504800	7508800	the nights that we don't have olr for whatever reason i'm sitting there at home sunday night
7508800	7513200	going this feels weird you know what to know what most of the time we still end up hanging out
7513200	7518400	anyway we have a lot of the times we get a pink berry we're like hey we don't have this show
7518400	7524160	tonight let's go get pink berry and then we talk about the show literally the last time the last
7524160	7527040	time we didn't have a show that's exactly what happened was that the night the internet kept us
7527040	7532000	from doing a show yeah so i was like and we went to breakfast that day because dan was watching
7532000	7538800	a stupid football so we're like let's go get pink berry later okay who's to show up no stupid
7538800	7543680	which was funny because not 15 minutes after we decided to call it my internet came back up
7544240	7551280	although it did end up going back down an hour later so i was like what the hell but we went
7551280	7559520	ahead pink berry and talked about the show we talked about 10 year stuff yeah which by the way
7559520	7564400	you need to work on that girly as soon as you get past all the other stuff one thing at a time i
7564400	7569520	know i know but seriously we i i i need to talk to you offline about something because i don't want
7569520	7573920	to say anything on air but you need to work on that because people are making travel plans
7573920	7578240	because i kind of let it slip to somebody like there might be something happening at such and
7578240	7584400	such place at such a such time really i'm booking my ticket right now shit now it has to happen
7585760	7591040	well because i can't let this person down yeah well it's it's gonna be a busy couple of months
7591040	7597440	because also a mutual friend of ours is graduating fun in may all right so go to their graduation say
7597440	7603680	have fun in the real world bye and then get back on planning the 10-year party oh yeah all right
7603680	7608960	i guess that's kind of a big deal that's a big deal all right so um but you know i also think

7616480	7624320	miserable i was before you know having the show gave me something to mark my weeks because
7624320	7634160	i really was just like what am i doing oh yeah i have the show and it really kept my my level
7634160	7639440	of consciousness of what was going on around me up instead of just falling into i'm depressed
7641600	7648880	um a lot of stuff that's like for instance um i got to go to e3 like five times you know i don't

7788240	7794880	while i've done this show i got laid off while doing the show i mean big major events in my
7794880	7802640	life went through a lot too on the show you know and i moved a few times i've had the same fucking
7802640	7809280	job for 10 years well you're you're mr stability well but i i can't complain i'm very happy with

7816000	7819360	things like i want to say like the whole unloud stuff that came up last week like jamie getting
7819360	7824560	to do that design thing and me getting to try the on-camera thing and and in some ways succeeding in
7824560	7829040	some ways falling on my face that would have not happened if it weren't for the show i mean i
7829040	7833600	probably would have met seg anyway because he's a he's a friend of somebody i knew from college but
7833600	7838880	it would have never but he's such a sweet person it would have never come to that without this show

7865840	7872400	that that's a big thing to you and also one thing i have to say that i've learned a lot of skills
7872400	7880000	doing the show you know definitely definite communication and a big lesson that i learned
7880720	7888000	is the the skill of no one cur seriously like remember that first like couple years and get
7888000	7893680	you see she's go back in in the kitchen and i'm like oh yeah the itunes reviews that said like
7893680	7897520	you know dark soccer needs to shut up and get back in the kitchen yeah i remember that one you're a
7897520	7904560	bitch so thank you yeah i i you know what i was upset for like five seconds and then i just

8042000	8046000	for not allowing me to change my cart in between matches because that kind of sucks that you can't
8046000	8053040	adjust that or for some reason having a clear way to quit online without resetting the game that's
8053040	8062080	kind of stupid i mean seriously you're still so mad no it's like it seriously i was picking the
8062080	8066480	seriously i was picking the car because i can see it counting i'm like fuck i don't have time to
8066480	8071920	switch all this shit also the poof gone like couldn't pick anything i had no time to pick
8071920	8081680	anything oh well um my a few of the week um oh god where do i begin uh you know the old saying
8081680	8087040	when it rains it pours and especially this time of year it's just kind of a it's a bad time of year
8087040	8092720	but i'm really looking forward to having vacation coming up because damn it i earned it and i'm
8092720	8099840	gonna go to disneyland and you need to help me move deal what what help me set up the um the
8099840	8105680	studio all right that i can do if you'll let me set up video okay if it's not pointed at me all
8105680	8111600	right we can see all right you're on the listeners have been demanding live video and we'll we need
8111600	8116400	to make their wishes come true so we'll work on it all right fine i will help you tech out the
8116400	8120800	new studio all right uh let's go back into some gaming news so we can get some calls here in a
8120800	8127360	minute uh loki i like that darth spazinator says if looking go one show without hacking something
8127360	8133600	or ranting someone should check to see if he has a fever or something yeah i'm in hack mode all the
8133600	8143520	time all the time he's hacking your life as we speak uh you mad okay so capcom is releasing a
8143520	8151040	capcom digital collection it includes a bunch of um you know xbox live arcade games basically it's
8151040	8158400	coming out for 40 bucks and it includes 1942 joint strike by commando re-armed two uh final fight
8158400	8166640	double impact flock rocket man axis of evil and also with the dlc it came from uranus and uh
8166640	8174240	super puzzle fighter 2 turbo hd remix super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix and wolf
8174240	8184480	of the battlefield commando 3 um all those available for 40 bucks um now correct me if
8184480	8190640	i'm wrong but i thought that one of those games at the very least i believe final fight double
8190640	8196640	impact required you be to be connected to xbox live in order to play it on register you know
8196640	8201360	registered because i think that was playstation network that was playstation network they didn't
8201360	8207120	have that i think it's been a while maybe this is where chat can help us out maybe i can't remember
8207120	8212080	but i thought that would be interesting if you know if it required you to play online that'd
8212080	8216880	be interesting well maybe they changed that yeah maybe but anyways it's about 100 bucks worth of
8216880	8224240	games for 40 bucks so good deal i guess if you don't already have them so i have at least a few
8224240	8231920	of those awesome all right well uh we were talking a little bit ago about e3 and uh this kind of goes
8231920	8236480	with that and kind of part of the reason why i joke yeah i probably won't be going to e3 anymore
8236480	8243840	unless loki helps a brother out but um e3 passes have doubled in cost and i know what you might be
8243840	8247440	thinking you might be like wait a minute you don't pay to go to e3 doesn't everybody go to e3 for
8247440	8252320	free like you register and you prove you're in the industry well yes for the most part most
8252320	8257360	everybody you see at e3 got in there for free because either they are tied into the industry
8257360	8261600	they um are in the media as a lot of the people obviously they are in kind of like the
8261600	8265600	not just the gaming uh the people that make the games so the people like purchase the games like
8265600	8271600	loki's industry distributors and all those people retail a lot of the folks that go but you also get
8271600	8278240	sometimes people that want to go because they're exploring getting into the business or students
8278240	8282560	or you know people that are kind of like exploring what type of business possible business ventures
8282560	8290080	they can make and this is why e3 sells expo passes so to believe it or not this whole time you could
8290080	8296400	really pay to go to e3 you could just say i'm exploring the industry or i'm a student wanting
8296400	8302640	to kind of get into this or whatever and you can pay and the prices used to be uh let's see it was
8302640	8308880	400 was last year's price if you registered before a certain date and 500 if you registered at the
8308880	8315680	door for three days you know it's expensive or you can say i'm sin bad or you could say you're sin
8315680	8322640	bad i got nothing to do today however the news is this year those prices have shot way up they've
8322640	8327760	doubled now it doesn't sound like they've doubled but they've doubled they multiply them by two and
8327760	8333680	then subtract five seven hundred and ninety five dollars before the deadline for a three-day pass
8333680	8338880	nine hundred and ninety five dollars you might as well say a thousand dollars for a pass to get into
8338880	8345840	e3 after april 23rd um so i mean that kind of sucks for people who want to explore like
8346400	8351680	i i'm not i'm trying to figure out why e3 is doing this my thought is they're trying to maybe
8351680	8357040	cut back on the people because there's some you know blogs and things have joked about this is
8357040	8362240	that well you're paying all this money to wait in line and i i have to agree like i didn't well
8362880	8368800	we didn't we didn't go to e3 last year remember that dark sakura we went to e3 we went into the
8368800	8373440	lobby yeah we hung out and like we got freebies from the lobby people were kind of looking at us
8373440	8378320	like where's their badges but we didn't go in into e3 itself but we were in the convention center
8378320	8382240	kind of between the two halls and i held a ds street pass with people so we're just kind of
8382240	8387760	like hanging out between and honestly i don't feel like i missed much i mean yeah there were
8387760	8393920	some big announcements didn't you get a wiimoto no i didn't get me a moto i think uh me or shane did
8394960	8401760	so he he got the me somebody did maybe bobby did but yeah i don't think it's worth that
8401760	8407840	much money to go stand around and wait in line i mean it would it would kind of like you know
8407840	8410960	i don't know it would suck if you've gone all these years and then suddenly you can't go anymore
8410960	8416320	like i know bobby's probably doing a lot of like how am i going to get an e3 this time because
8416320	8420400	unfortunately the media standards they do this weird measurement where they're measuring your
8420400	8425760	website traffic well if you're a show like us they're looking for so many hundred visits a month
8425760	8430160	which we would hit easy on subscriptions we would easily hit i'm sorry they're looking for like
8430160	8433760	thousand but we would still hit that on subscriptions because with four shows a month
8433760	8436800	and everything we would hit that number on the subscriptions that people download our podcast
8436800	8440320	but that's not how they measure it because they're looking at who's visiting the website
8440320	8444320	and because our website doesn't really have a lot of cutting edge content on it
8444320	8446560	i mean well what if our website was the rss feed
8448880	8453680	i that might i don't know if it would work or not we'll see unfortunately the website
8453680	8459200	fuck-ups last month might damage that and i don't know but i don't know it's whatever arbitrary
8459200	8464400	scale they want to use and i i get what they're trying to do like it was so easy for somebody to
8464400	8469600	just start their own website and get 20 of their friends in e3 under that website i feel like they
8469600	8474080	did have to draw the line somewhere but i think they drew it too far out that us indie people
8474080	8483840	kind of get fucked you know anyway i say that we uh do a commando entrance and say that we're
8483840	8490480	worth modern warfare all right so good luck getting into e3 if you don't belong to a website
8490480	8496800	that gets so many thousand hits a month anyhow moving on happier news dark sakura maybe not
8497760	8506480	vita we've got vita mens um no actually not really um what is going on with the vita they
8506480	8511440	are actually getting rid of the instruction booklet guess what apple did it first mean or
8511440	8518880	neener um they're actually having digital manuals that you can access in game for each of the games
8518880	8527440	so um it puts people like me out of the job that like printing um but you can still design online
8527440	8533920	stuff uh yeah i could still still do pdfs and everything i mean that's not a big deal but
8533920	8540320	they're basically going to be um doing in-game manuals well it's still kind of yucky though i
8540320	8544720	mean i i don't know i'm i'm torn because it's like how many times do i really read the instruction
8544720	8548160	manual well it makes sense because they're already creating them anyways because they're offering all
8548160	8553360	their games digitally as well as at retail so if they're already creating those digital things why
8553360	8558880	make them printed but then i think about back in the nes days like the manual to the legend of
8558880	8563440	zelda that kind of like told the story in the first few pages so that was awesome i miss that
8563440	8568400	kind of shit but i i get it like now i don't i don't really bother reading manuals i mean look
8568400	8573760	at skyrim skyrim came in with a foldout map that it's made to look like parchment and shit hmm i
8573760	8578960	mean they still would do that kind of stuff like i remember like my copy of grandia that had a cloth
8578960	8587920	map you know they still do amazing manuals and stuff in japan here not so much even in the old
8587920	8596160	days wow so i think it's just i mean i understand yeah it'll save some money but in the end it
8596160	8601360	really detracts from the product i think but then again apple did that when they released the iphone
8601360	8607760	no instruction manual remember that's true it just had a how to hook it up all in their bookstore now
8607760	8612400	you can get a full manual in the bookstore but you don't need it yeah there's a video of a
8612400	8620240	three-year-old using one sending text messages but i'm just i'm just saying you know it's not a new
8620240	8626000	thing cloud cleveland in our chat room says gotta save those trees you know what for every tree
8626000	8631040	that's cut down in the united states three more are planted i think i i i have a feeling it's a
8631040	8638560	little bit tongue in cheek that comment i know but i it's not an excuse i it's it's a cost saving
8638560	8643280	measure is what it is that's what it is let's let's be real it's a cost saving measure it costs
8643280	8646880	money to print those books and they decided they could save money on getting the game out there by
8646880	8652400	just getting rid of the books and putting it's true i mean i i understand and i agree but i mean
8653200	8660320	it's putting a whole but it's it's the end of an industry of printing it's sad yeah but of course
8660320	8665600	well if you think about it though jamie i hate to say it but a lot of printing industry is going
8665600	8671920	digital i mean look at i love the smell of ink i know but and i think there will still always be
8671920	8676960	demand for things like movie posters advertising still big and all that but like look at things
8676960	8683680	like you know the new york times is on the freaking ipad now and that's how people get it
8683680	8687440	but you know what i think that the whole thing about the print industry in and of itself is
8687440	8694000	turning more into a specialty market because there are now a there's a resurgence of um quality
8694000	8700080	magazines if you know what i mean that are like artsy magazines that are like nice thick paper
8700640	8707200	and done in a certain size those and they charge quite a bit for them but they know their market
8707200	8713360	they're the people who are print files and or look at look at look at the stuff you had to do
8713360	8716640	for umlaut there's a lot of like design shit that people don't even think about like somebody made
8716640	8720320	the badges somebody made the photo background somebody made the you know uh flyers somebody
8720320	8725040	made you know there's a lot of stuff i did the digital ones too you know so i mean
8727120	8730480	as see that's why well there's also people who need to design game covers
8731760	8735440	that's true do you need to do the layout on the back that will never go away that's not gonna go
8735440	8740640	away that's why i get really irritated when people buy a nice expensive box set and then they just
8740640	8744880	throw the boxes away it's like do you realize that someone put work into that just think of
8744880	8747760	some of the great covers we've had in gaming like the original mega man cover
8749520	8754400	well well here's an example for you remember rolling stone used to do the top 100 album
8754400	8761120	covers of all time do we have that anymore do they still do this well of all time no because
8761120	8766800	they already made it well i know what you mean though once you have to be somebody like lady
8766800	8771600	gaga for people to get excited about your cover because you're doing something like like the
8771600	8778320	bitch is a bike what yeah but i mean it's it's really that i think that people are really stopping
8778320	8784640	are taking their design for granted they're so used to seeing something that's well done and
8784640	8790480	clean now as opposed to the shit we had in the 80s that it's all being taken for granted and
8790480	8795920	then you have to think about you know like the manuals all of that is somebody someone's got
8795920	8801200	to design that you know and yeah it's cool to have it you know digital because then you can have it
8801200	8808880	in color you have to pray you know pray please pay for four color process which is expensive
8809920	8815920	but at the same time you know i think it's it's really sad it does take something out of
8817760	8823040	an entire industry all right i know that's i would be the only one in this house that would go off on
8823040	8827360	that all right just a couple more stories for you guys i like the smell of ink shut up and then
8827360	8832240	we're going to get to the skype line at 1877 game olr and the twitter at twitter.com slash
8832240	8841360	olr but first loki yes um so let's talk a little bit about um my favorite discussion topic
8842080	8852320	skylanders and i said before you know you guys are only encouraging them i mean if
8852320	8858160	anyways so activision they're taking skylanders a little bit further they're branching out onto
8858160	8863760	into an online world if you will with skylanders universe and what skylanders universe is going to
8863760	8870960	be it's basically like um the free realms thing that they have for sony online it's basically a
8870960	8878400	world where you can go purchase a piece of the virtual skyland and customize it however you want
8878400	8883360	along with a skylander character and i guess it's filled a bunch of different little mini games and
8883360	8891120	stuff like that and they're gonna have constant updates to go along with it as well um no word on
8891120	8897520	integration though with the actual characters although i would i would imagine that they're
8897520	8905440	going to have something like that or you know i see a button that says rental so obviously they're
8905440	8912480	charging for something but um i mean seriously guys just i hear so many people going wow you know
8913920	8919040	this is like i've always wished for something to interact with you know my games and stuff they
8919040	8925360	come with these you buy these toys okay they're little figures they don't do anything at all and
8926160	8932960	i mean if call of duty were to come out with some little green plastic army men that did nothing and
8932960	8938800	they would charge eight dollars for you know each dlc character people will find the repo fuck marvel
8938800	8945920	versus capcom 3 when they were charging six dollars per character for dlc people bitched like
8945920	8951920	crazy saying what the fuck you expect me to pay six dollars for a fucking character that was on
8951920	8957680	disk hey you're paying eight dollars for a character that's on disk with you know skylanders
8957680	8965760	and guess what you keep buying them so they're gonna keep releasing them so i have you guys to
8965760	8970320	thank for that thank you people that got all fucking nostalgic about it because guess what
8970320	8975360	when next call duty comes out you're gonna be fucking paying eight dollars for whatever a gun
8975360	8982640	you're gonna get a little plastic gun i sense you're really upset about something it's just
8982640	8987760	annoying it's just like people complain about the prices of why are they charging so much why is
8987760	8994080	there so much dlc for for these games why am i not like getting only half a game at the buy the rest
8994080	8998400	in dlc it's because you're willing to pay eight dollars for a fucking plastic figurine that does
8998400	9005040	nothing to play as a character in a game and not only will you buy one but you'll buy tons of them
9005040	9010720	that's why they keep selling you fucking dlc for your games because you're a fucking sucker that's
9010720	9015920	why you will buy whatever the company puts out even if it's for a franchise that's brand new
9015920	9022880	that's pretty much nothing to do with spiro at all zero there's a character that resembles
9022880	9028000	spiro it's not really spiro anymore and then a bunch of other tertiary characters that really
9028000	9033760	take the forefront and that's it i love salacious pop's comment in chat room if it didn't cost like
9033760	9038800	380 to do it it would be awesome to hold an olr drive to surprise loki's tyke with a fluke
9038800	9049200	skylanders rig for christmas what a cruel thing to do to loki you wouldn't care he plays with
9049200	9059840	he tried to eat he tried to eat the toys all right one more story for you guys here uh and it's about
9059840	9064240	an online you were done right sorry yeah okay one more story for you guys here just trying to get
9064240	9068960	to skyline and it's about need for speed world do you know need for speed world do you remember this
9068960	9075200	this is the need for speed online free mmo they have right yeah stan was playing it yes it's it's
9075200	9085120	it's all right but um there is now in this free game a special conno seg koenig seg ccx elite
9085120	9089520	edition car and it's kind of like you know you can buy it because usually like freemium games
9089520	9095280	have things you can buy in them right well guess how much this car will set you back five dollar
9095280	9101440	one hundred dollars what oh tons of people will buy it because oh man i've always wanted like a
9101440	9107440	race car i'm gonna get a race car for my online game because i will pay a hundred dollars for dlc
9107440	9114880	give me more it's it's all for profit right this yeah of course this is i'm looking at the actual
9114880	9120160	press release here it says that there's the first premium elite car available to all need for speed
9120160	9127600	world players via the in-game store for 100 by the way oh get this get this for a limited time
9127600	9134480	until december 21st you can get the super car for 75 dollars this is 25 discount well shit i'm
9134480	9141840	jumping on that right now it's elite this is like you know this is an interesting me verb
9141840	9146000	this is an interesting trend in mmos lately and god damn i hope wow doesn't go down this path
9146000	9150880	although i would say the 25 amounts are kind of pushing it and i i have yet to buy a 25 dollar
9150880	9157280	amount i never will steed right now i never fuck that steed no but here's the thing um like other
9157280	9161760	mms was doing this i remember bobby was talking on his show because he he's dabbled in eve online
9161760	9166800	i think or he knows people that are playing it and um they had the whole monocle thing that was
9166800	9172000	being sold for like 60 bucks like it's just but some people in order to really stand out in a
9172000	9177680	crowd and have the biggest epine will pay that money i mean think about it why was there so much
9177680	9183520	internet rage about people getting into that star wars the old republic game different times this
9183520	9188400	week people were pissed that they weren't first that they couldn't have the first level 50
9188400	9193440	character although let's be real nobody that was complaining about it is going to be the one to
9193440	9197760	have that first level 50 character you know the person that has the first level 50 character
9198720	9204240	is probably a group of people that are pushing their way to it you know just just to have the
9204240	9211360	biggest pain you know what i mean yeah like people will do pay anything to get ahead and have the
9211360	9220320	biggest pain yeah and i'm sure that thing sold quite a few cars probably not a ton but enough
9220320	9228160	to make ea probably do it again we're just sad remember that app that when you know the iphone
9228160	9234160	first came about and they had an app that was like five thousand dollars or some shit for
9234160	9238560	sparkling diamond thing that spun around and that's all it did yeah people bought that shit
9238560	9246400	too because they're dumb and and i'd like to point out once again how stupid skylinders is
9246400	9250960	take a look at this picture of spiro from skylanders he looks like he got fucking kicked
9250960	9256560	in the teeth and some teeth got knocked out and he's like raging now i don't know it's just
9256560	9264480	really stupid looking he where did his teeth go it's kind of i mean seriously he looks so derpy
9264480	9273120	now it's derpy spiro i love it derp bro all right anyhow that's gonna do it for stories

9378640	9383920	i'll be at home i'll bust it out after i'll best it out after the show oh wait maybe i won't be at
9383920	9387520	home i don't know how long the family stuff is going i may not be at home actually so i can't
9387520	9391520	promise that but if i am at home i will be on after bobby lockwell yeah and you know what i'll
9391520	9399440	do what take a nap shush did you just call in to troll loki tonight uh yes but uh i do have other
9399440	9404560	things i can comment on okay everything yeah yeah tell us about the e3 thing you've been e3 eight
9404560	9409440	eight how many freaking years in a row 18 years in a row or something crazy 15 years 15 years in a
9409440	9417120	row and i paid 75 to get the exhibits only pass in 97 my first year oh my gosh and so now it's
9417120	9424880	five dollars for the three-day expo pass wow it's got it it always has gone up and like 400 was a
9424880	9429360	big jump because i think the last time i had paid i was like it was still like 150 or so
9429360	9436080	it's a 200 and but what i think is going on is that they're really trying to keep people like me
9436080	9442720	out because i've you know about half of my e3s have been free either through the media or through
9442720	9447360	my industry or through software development credentials or whatever um and the other half
9447360	9452240	have been free and i always had that to kind of fall back on and what they're i'm gonna kind of
9452240	9456720	equate it to something that's uh i don't know if they've got these type of toll roads out in
9456720	9462240	california but they just opened one in georgia where they increase the price to dissuade people
9462240	9468720	from using that lane on the road there's one lane it's an hov pass they just started those in the
9468720	9473440	bay area the whole fast track carpool lane where it's like you yeah depending on how many cars are
9473440	9477760	in it the price goes up during certain times of the day yeah yeah yeah so i think e3 is trying
9477760	9482560	to do the same thing they're like well if these bloggers that really shouldn't that we don't feel
9482560	9487040	have a right to be here are willing to pay the 400 let's see if they're willing to pay the 800
9487600	9494000	and there are there is probably people that will say no that's too much and uh you know if they're
9494000	9498160	not a legitimate business they can't write it off as a business expense or anything like that
9498160	9502240	so what they're trying to do is they're trying to limit the amount of people that they don't think
9502240	9507200	should be at e3 from still getting into e3 because that's been the dirty little secret is as long as
9507200	9514800	you're over 18 you could pay and it didn't matter what your job was wow and you know you it didn't
9514800	9519200	matter what you did if you gave them the money they gave you a pass and said have fun all right
9519200	9523600	just it just it just kind of stinks that some of us who you know have been trying so hard for so
9523600	9528240	long kind of you know get the shaft and you know there's some there's some people that do get those
9528240	9532480	numbers that kind of look down on the rest of us and say well just try harder but it's kind of like
9532480	9538960	well it's it's it's tougher when they don't get what we're doing and that i'm not here to create
9538960	9544160	a website you know what i mean right and they don't mind because they've got enough people
9544160	9549040	doing coverage that do have websites yeah and a lot of podcasting networks someone like you know
9549040	9554560	all games gets passes you know they've got enough and you know some other podcasting networks
9554560	9560000	basically they just pool all together but the individual shows themselves don't exactly have
9560000	9564480	the website visitors unless they've got a vibrant community that they've built up right and
9564480	9570800	unfortunately you know just our situation is kind of unique with the chat room and the the live
9570800	9575680	streaming and then the podcast and stuff and there's just they don't want to deal with it
9575680	9581120	you know they already feel they allow too many media in and so they're not going to change
9581120	9585200	anything they do so i'm not even going to bother with the media pass this year i'm but see what
9585200	9590320	they've done to me is the way i got in last year was through my day job because i'm a software
9590320	9596400	developer and yes we actually do work on ios stuff and i have done gaming you know gaming
9596400	9601600	exploratory stuff with my day job so technically i'm a game developer right and that's usually
9601600	9607600	good enough well apparently they've kind of updated their industry rule and now they actually
9607600	9612800	check your company's website to see if you publicly have ties to the gaming industry wow
9612800	9616800	and since we don't have any completed projects our website just talks about the real estate
9616800	9622080	websites which is our main revenue it says nothing about the gaming so if i i'm afraid
9622080	9627200	if i i mean i'm still going to try to apply and send my w2 and the tax id and all the stuff that
9627200	9631760	i need that i was eligible with last year i'm going to send it in and but they may look at the
9631760	9637920	website and say you're not in the gaming industry wow it's like they're paying all these people to
9637920	9641840	investigate who's going i mean i i kind of get that something's got to give because the
9641840	9647120	show has a lot of people there but at the same time there are a lot of people that shouldn't be
9647120	9653600	there right but in order to keep them out they also have to get some of the people that probably
9653600	9657760	do have more acclaim because a lot of the companies there do believe i should be there
9657760	9663600	but it's not up to them who gets invited to e3 it was at one point yes and i got in those years
9663600	9670880	yeah yeah funny enough my first e3 was thanks to friends of konami yeah so it's it's in fact
9670880	9675040	dark soccer could say the same thing i think and for a couple years was kind of that went into ddr
9675040	9678880	because well because we were all while doing ddr oriented stuff and you know konami was really
9678880	9682880	pushing those games when they came out those years so they definitely wanted to see us there
9682880	9686960	but it's um you know and uh we were there the year beatmania launched in america and obviously
9686960	9691600	they knew that that would be a big thing we you know we tried to get the word out but unfortunately
9691600	9697360	uh just wasn't it's time so so i mean and that's what it is and i'm not going to sit here and qq
9697360	9702160	over you know not getting in to go to go to e3 or something or it being a little bit too expensive
9702160	9707840	or something um you know but it but it does you know from a personal level it does kind of suck
9707840	9712560	because i've gone every year right right it kind of sucks and there are people that i see there
9712560	9717760	that i only see once a year and to me e3 is more about the people and not the games i actually
9717760	9723200	talk to more people and network more than i actually play games unless it was 2007 when only
9723200	9727440	like two thousand three thousand people were there and i actually played a lot more games what's
9727440	9734240	gonna happen to our disney trip i don't know i'm sad remember we went to we went to we went to
9734240	9739920	disneyland with bobby this year at e3 that's why we went to e3 we went to pick bobby up i wanted
9739920	9743920	that to become a new tradition maybe i'll just have to like book a ticket out to uh sacramento
9743920	9747920	sometime we'll just or we'll just go hang in the convention center take you to fairy tale town
9747920	9751440	i need to i need to actually clue you in on what's going on for the 10th anniversary or what we're
9751440	9755040	trying to plan because i just realized i haven't told you yet so it'll be awesome if you can make
9755040	9761200	an appearance but if not totally understand it's expensive so all right actually actually the the
9761200	9766880	only expensive part would be uh like a hotel room but if i didn't need one of those we can work
9766880	9773200	something out it's good it's gonna be somewhat local i i really have to watch my mouth because
9773200	9779600	nothing has been sealed yet but jamie's gonna work on that real soon when she's done what's
9779600	9785120	worrying her now see i know i know i'm on your side jamie in the new year thank you bobby all
9785120	9789040	right well then bobby that means i need to hang up on you now all right all right all right take
9789040	9796800	care take care guys loki uh get some practice in all right stop trolling bye bobby hung up yeah
9796800	9803360	yeah yes he gets one lucky race and then all of a sudden yeah see how fucking good you are without
9803360	9809120	those fucking items yeah we'll see where the real racing is but that's all right bobby for what it's
9809120	9813200	worth you guys but i know we we plug him a lot but if you're not listening to bobby blackwolf
9813200	9816960	he really works hard on his show and it's a great show and it's kind of like a i always kind of call
9816960	9820960	it like an npr style show because it's just him talking about games but you know you can hear his
9820960	9825680	voice when he talks to us there he has a great radio voice and you know he really kind of thinks
9825680	9829920	about the topics he's going to talk about and so he's kind of able to sustain the show himself
9829920	9834000	and then yet interact with the chatters he kind of does like part one and part two and in part one
9834000	9839120	it's him and in part two it's the chatters and uh he does a great job so definitely listen to the
9839120	9845200	show and we're happy to be on the same night same network as him let's go to the phones and take
9845200	9850320	more calls higher on orange launch radio who's this hello hello who's this hello this is
9850320	9857200	catastrophic moggie where are you from catastrophic moggie a long long way away i'm in the uk oh my
9857200	9865120	gosh it is way past your bedtime young man talk about it's five in the morning oh my god well
9865120	9870720	thank you for staying up late listening to us good heavens well what did you call in to talk
9870720	9876640	about tonight there's a there's a couple of things uh your really big bundle is actually the indie
9876640	9883760	royale and they have the xmas bundle up now which includes the black world trilogy remastered eats
9883760	9889920	dino d-day and the oil blue just in case you're interested also going back a little bit about your
9890640	9896480	about the peripheral for the 3ds nintendo have been doing this for years remember the n64
9896480	9905520	they had the memory expansion slot which also you needed for uh zelda uh oh god the horrible one
9905520	9914640	the horse mask yes the nintendo have been doing this for a long time that's true nintendo always
9914640	9918560	just kind of put out these extra little things and then suddenly the game requires it later on that's
9918560	9923840	that's very true nothing new for nintendo they did the same thing with the um uh uh what the
9923840	9928880	hell was i talking about earlier the um we we with the we motion plus did the gamecube do anything
9928880	9931520	like that i don't think the gamecube did i think that's the one system that kind of stayed
9931520	9936240	consistent i don't remember i remember they had those wave birds were awesome the wireless
9936240	9942080	controllers but that was that's all i can think of there it just seems every generation they tried
9942080	9947600	to do one thing they did they had the game boy advance cable but there were so few games didn't
9947600	9953040	they have like a network thing yeah fantasy star online used it that's it uh maybe one other game
9953040	9957520	mario kart land that was a that was a the warp pipe or whatever it was called that was a terrible
9957520	9962720	terrible thing nintendo did putting that out there and then just never using it so you know
9962720	9966960	i catastrophic maggie since you're calling him from the uk i've got to say it it's you must kind
9966960	9972320	of laugh when we bitch about how we're having to wait all this time for xenoblade to come out over
9972320	9978640	here because nintendo's been fucking over you guys for years with her releases huh that's one of the
9978640	9983280	weirdest things who'd have thought nintendo would ever release a game here first except you know
9983280	9989520	maybe tingle tingle rpg we never i don't think we ever did get that tingle rpg no we didn't i don't
9989520	9996960	think so that's sad it's tragic loki had it pre-ordered and everything oh yeah totally uh no
9998160	10002960	did he have his pre-order for his costume as well at the same time i i wish i wish yeah and
10002960	10007040	unfortunately they cancelled that too i'm sorry shame shame
10007040	10013600	shame talking about that though the funny thing is you're talking about manuals
10014720	10020160	uh in the uk though i mean you said japan japan gets better manuals than you but in the uk most
10020160	10026640	of our manuals have always been black and white even when um you get nice color manuals we just
10026640	10031760	get cheap black and white ones you get the seven cent copies from kinkos whereas we're having to
10031760	10037120	deal with the the uh or as we get the color ones that's that's great man you guys been getting the
10037120	10042080	shaft on your releases for years why is that why do you guys have to wait and then you don't even
10042080	10047760	get the nice manuals the probable reason is because europe has a lot of languages
10050080	10056720	that's true we get we usually get really thick manuals with 10 different languages also in it
10056720	10063280	well few pages for english french german blah blah blah you know what's interesting even here now all
10063280	10069040	the nintendo games usually have their manuals in three languages uh english french and spanish and
10069040	10074000	i'm assuming that's because they they do a lot of big north american region launches so they have
10074000	10079040	french for the canadians and spanish for the mexicans but it's just interesting just trying
10079040	10085680	to save money i guess i guess um one last question sure i remember a few years ago you were going to
10085680	10091840	do a euro a europe show and it got cancelled at the last second it did and we ended up starting
10091840	10097840	the marathon show we did a couple months later at noon are you ever going to do another are you ever
10097840	10102640	going to plan another europe show i'm sure this late is not good for my health i'm i'm i think
10102640	10107440	we're gonna have to at at our friend's request we're gonna have to do another uk show so we need
10107440	10113760	to do another marathon shows i'd be absolutely thrilled to well um we did mention a little bit
10113760	10119520	about maybe maybe we should do something earlier in the day on new year's eve may wait no we're
10119520	10123040	not doing a show new year's eve it's new year's day new year's day at this one no so we want to
10123040	10130320	do a show later trust me yeah well because i'll be hung up now i don't get hungover but um we were
10130320	10134240	we were definitely we had talked about it we definitely wouldn't mind trying something like
10134240	10138160	that again if the schedules work out yeah i'd love to do another marathon show at some point
10138160	10145600	um and do more of like the live gaming and playing the games so sometime in 2012 for sure early 2012
10146560	10153680	so that's good okay can i ask you a question sure because i want to be sure that i could i have this

10236320	10241920	here oh god where am i gonna start off here um okay um
10241920	10248160	um let me see i gotta screen this story first because they don't say anything on this
10249600	10255920	okay uh we got a tweet from cloud cleveland that links us to a story on screwattack.com
10255920	10261440	that talks about game gadget system wants to be ipod gaming oh this is kind of neat it looks like
10262080	10268400	somebody's changed like a typical ipod to put a little kind of like what looks like a little um
10268400	10274400	i guess you could say a ds like the bottom half of a ds kind of turn it into one of those
10274400	10279920	they call it an open source game system from the uk-based company game gadget and it's called the
10279920	10286000	game gadget 1.0 the press release doesn't appear to say a lot but let's go to a quote from jason
10286000	10290480	cooper who created the game gadget quote game gadget has been designed with the ultimate goal
10290480	10295680	of playing every game on a single device just as the ipod was for music hundreds of thousands of
10295680	10300800	games are currently archived and no longer being enjoyed by gamers with no value being generated
10300800	10304960	for the developers and publishers the launch of game gadget creates a market for gamers to play
10304960	10309280	the games that want to play uh that they want to play the game gadget game service just like
10309280	10314000	apple's app store allows the owners of these games to remarket their back catalog in their original
10314000	10319280	format set the appropriate pricing and gain incremental revenue but with no additional
10319280	10323680	investment okay so i get it so it's not actually like an ipod it just kind of looks like one with
10323680	10327680	its its plugins and stuff and they're just trying to build like an app store for games
10329360	10335360	um i it would be interesting to see if they get the buy-in because i don't know if they're going
10335360	10344480	to actually get the buy-in on that so all right um i need to reopen the skype line because i
10344480	10349280	just realized there is one more call i promised we would take tonight and i totally slipped my

10649600	10653440	he can promote both all right quickly let's try to close out some of these tweets um
10654160	10660240	i gotta say a couple tweets about the xbox live call earlier um people in the same situation this
10660240	10666160	one from sj100 matt this story on olr just now scared me into changing my xbox live accounts
10666160	10671280	password to email address to it change yours or you might get screwed i say up a good advice at
10671280	10676480	least you know you're going to be better off also from sj100 matt here's an ask orange launch radio
10676480	10685840	question which is better waffles pancakes or french toast rank them it depends on where they're
10685840	10691600	from but i will take my favorites of all okay number one is the french toast at sam's kosher
10691600	10698240	style deli you've had it i have it's epic number two are the banana cream uh waffles
10699120	10704800	at um charlie's that's across the street from my neighborhood and number three um
10707600	10715440	i guess i hop um pumpkin pancakes loki pancakes would definitely be dead last that's a toss-up
10715440	10722240	between waffles and uh french toast because it depends where you go actually terrible or good
10722240	10729440	in its own category should be waffle house waffles just saying uh for me waffles are way up here
10729440	10735360	number one waffle waffle waffle way up high and then below that pancakes and french toast i gotta
10735360	10741120	i gotta rate french toast last i'm sorry don't get me wrong it's still good and i'll never pass on it
10741120	10745040	unless i'm like not feeling well but remember the sweet potato pancakes that we got that didn't
10745040	10750240	taste very sweet potato oh yeah maybe they have some sort of unholy turducken of like pancakes
10750240	10756560	waffles and french toast you know where you like take french toast and like the the monty cristo
10756560	10763120	of breakfast food like yeah you like take french toast and you maybe like put some waffle batter
10764480	10771840	with french toast made of challah and we stuff it with a crispy waffle filled with pancake i
10771840	10775760	love salacious pops comment and chat what the fuck is this sophie's choice shit
10778240	10786000	agree think how it feels for us uh stirlock says it's a tweet vita shuts out the blind
10786000	10791360	you can't use the buttons in the menus therefore making the system completely unusable for us
10792160	10795920	really i'm trying to think now see i haven't seen the vita or look at the interface at all
10795920	10801680	so i know i know he's talking about it looks like bubbles blind is it because since you can't use
10801680	10806160	the tangible buttons and obviously a blind person can't see the touch screen or know where to touch
10806160	10810080	yeah they're that's why they're screwed yep because you can't use tangible buttons well that's messed
10810080	10818240	up sony needs to think about everybody hopefully in a patch i mean i have seen handicap accessibility
10818240	10823600	happen in patching not that that's gonna be a great answer for right now because that doesn't
10823600	10827760	because that doesn't look good for the us launch but hey you know what we say buddy
10827760	10832880	vote with your wallet if you can't play it don't buy one alan is telling all about you
10834000	10840960	ooh what oh did i eat waffles with nothing on them yeah i like i like plain i was like tell me
10840960	10846080	i do the same thing i burn them to a crisp and then i fuck yeah burned oh so good but
10846080	10851040	know what i've been doing lately though is just screw the you know scrutiny sort of like utensils
10851040	10855440	you just pour a stack of four waffles you pour syrup on the top a ton of syrup on top i don't
10855440	10861280	even like syrup oh i love syrup yeah enjoy my stuff man it's it's fucking good it's not that

10899200	10902400	well yeah it's still in an early alpha state but it makes you wonder why doesn't Bethesda

10924080	10929440	got you know right some of that all right and uh let's see i got another tweet from tiger claw
