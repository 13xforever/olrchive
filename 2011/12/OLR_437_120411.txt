A fan-demanded Wii game is finally set for release in the US.
Valve trolls everyone with a new t-shirt.
And the Comedy Central show is set to get a new video game.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
It is December 4th, 2011.
It's the 437th episode of our show.
Wee Wee Wee Wee Wee
Anyway, also say hello to, hopefully feeling a little less like an animal, making animal noises all night tonight Say hello to Loki No, I'm not going to make animal noises all night Thank gosh, alright, how are you doing, Loki?
Fine Yeah, alright, good Actually, I don't know about you guys, I am doing very, very well I got great news, literally, two minutes, literally, two minutes before we went live tonight Like, after the call with Bobby on his show, before our show went live
Our website is coming back.
Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
For those who have not been following the drama, OrangeLawnsRadio.com has been down due to some stuff and things.
We'll leave it at that.
And out of our control.
And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes.
Namely, and I want to give a shout out to Jason and Deekman behind the scenes have ensured that it will be back up.
Now, here's the thing.
I could flip the switch right now and some people would see it.
But it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out.
The way DNS works, it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours.
Exactly.
So that also keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.
Stop.
Alright, but anyhow, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.
We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site so everybody will get the show and we'll have a website again.
Yay!
You better watch out though.
If they catch you pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison for no reason.
Why are we talking about this?
I'm trying to be happy about the show.
I'm happy.
Coming back for the show.
Yay.
Party.
All right, anyhow.
OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
By the time the podcast-y people download this and hear it, it's probably back up and running.
Live listeners, you're finding out about two minutes after I did.
I said you all would be the first to know.
Yay.
So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, because right now I'm trying to do a show.
Why are you showing me up your sleeve?
I'm looking at my fake watch.
even though we are not televised I'm still going through motions and looking at my fake watch
Anyhow, what else was I going to say?
Damn you, woman.
You threw me off.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
It does work.
It's up right now, even on the backup site for the folks listening live.
We do encourage you to join our chat room at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want, such as Jim Sally in our chat room says, 24-hour pirate special at OLR.com.
R.
You can get lots of booty at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright, um Yes, what?
You have that look on your face like I have something smart ass I'm gonna say Yes, but it doesn't fit into the conversation that we're having right now Does it ever fit into the conversation we're having right now?
It's unfortunately a week too late A week too late?
Yes, it is a week too late Alright, now I have to know, what's your week old joke?
Say it Well, the Xbox Luba has a slick interface
No, it's still funny.
Xbox lube jokes are still funny.
It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website.
But there will be.
Anyhow.
All right, look.
I want to talk about other exciting things.
Not only is our website coming back up, but there's an awesome charity event.
We've pimped this on the show for years.
There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday, in San Francisco.
So if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you need to go to this event because I'm going to be there.
DarkSakura's going to be there.
Loki, you're not going to be there.
I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part of it.
I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim.
The moment I said that, Shermie looked up at me like, the hell you will.
But here's the thing, DarkSakura and I are going to San Francisco, and Salacious doesn't call, we don't call Salacious Pop anymore, but Alan is going to.
To be very honest, you know, had I not been locked into the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have bid and won that, uh, the be on the stage thing, you know.
Oh yeah, I know, do the rock band.
Because I like winning eBay auctions, so you know.
Well, let me back up.
For those that don't know what Loom Loud is, because I know we've talked about this for years on the show.
We're very grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like... Some people in chat were mentioning earlier, I've been listening for five years.
I've been listening since this was single digits on the show.
We've been pimping this for a long time.
It's a great charity event.
It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA Lounge, which is an actual venue.
And there's a lot of famous stuff that happens at DNA Lounge.
Club Booty is one of the biggest examples of that.
That's the mashup club night where they actually mash songs together.
And some of those...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and that money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event which is really worth it alone but you get to pick a prize off the swag table and I'm not allowed to say what I know about the swag table this year but there's like really good stuff that people are going to walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event and they're going to be doing a raffle they're going to be doing these silent auctions I don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction I don't know what I can and can't say so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty but I will say
but I will say this the silent auction stuff is amazing too like one of the items in particular oh my god oh my god anybody that like grew up on an NES is gonna lose their shit over this it's amazing so and I can't remember if that's one of the eBay ones or not because yes you're gonna be able to participate online as well and you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and and and this is so cool you're gonna get to watch it online it's all streaming at umloud.org and why am I pimping this so bad?
I'd be pimping it anyway but I'm especially pimping it because there's a live pre-show for the first time ever that's going to be happening video from it and they asked me to co-host so I'm going to be doing it with some other friends in the gaming community including Carnage who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff which will be very cool some other folks from other websites are involved too so it's no like singular website doing it this is not an OLR show it's just we're helping we're one of the cooks in the kitchen with this
and it's going to be great.
Met a lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place and yeah, it's going to be a kick-ass show.
So make plans to be here.
Thursday, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern, umloud.org.
Now you have no excuse not to be there.
It's going to be delivered to your house.
Thank you for watching!
We are going to lend our full support and if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what?
We'll have a drink together.
I can say at least that much.
Yeah.
We're not really going to make out with you.
No.
Okay.
And DarkSakura will not show you her boobs.
No.
But I am the designer this year.
I will not say much more than that but you get to see my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall.
Mm-hmm.
and other things.
Good stuff.
So yeah.
And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little creepy because I don't do video.
Like I've done...
you can see my work on that too I've done audio stuff since 97 so this is one of the first I mean besides back when we were doing the Justin TV like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show which I don't think makes for exciting video but some people miss it maybe it'll come back someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it but yeah I'm excited I'm into it I'm happy
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Granted to borrow, not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months.
You completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister.
From the dollar store, yes.
I got Rob a penguin snow globe at the dollar store.
It was the thought that counts.
I waited in line twice as long as I spent shopping.
I hate the dollar store this time of year.
Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler At least he's a little balder than me But cuter Which isn't saying much
Anyhow.
All right.
Look, it's not about that.
It's about getting you guys to show up.
They know.
This is the thing.
They know that the OLR and that the All Games people are rabid people.
And when we will do this stuff, they're more likely to show up.
So you guys have to represent.
Not just OLR, but all games.
And show up and cheer loudly and be excited about Umlaut.
And most of all, please donate.
I know it's a tough time of year, but keep in mind the charity.
There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher.
And we're going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity.
So again, umlaut.org on Thursday.
All righty.
How about video games?
Let's get back into how our gaming weeks were and all that good stuff.
We always like to kick off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I played stuff that wasn't well.
That made me play well, too.
Last night started the family tradition.
We broke out the Saturn and played Christmas nights.
Oh, it must be the holidays.
And then we realized that our battery wasn't working, so we couldn't save anything.
Dan decided that he was going to play Rayearth anyway, so he started playing Rayearth.
I finally played my copy of P.O.P.O.
2 on the Sega Saturn, and you know what?
That game sucks.
Not that it sucks that it's a bad game, because P.O.P.O.
is awesome.
It kicked my ass.
I am that out of practice on P.O.P.O.
and we played through Parodius Da we played through GKL Parodius sorry, Gokujil Parodius we played through a little bit of Oshaberry Parodius a lot of Parodius Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn and then he beat Thunder Force 3
On Saturn.
Like, just sat down and played.
There's apparently something called Kids Mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields.
So he was just doing Stress Relief Mode, pretty much.
I played, actually, some of the Blue Seed RPG, until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG, because I read like a retarded five-year-old in Japanese.
You had quite the Sega-filled retro week, didn't you?
There's more.
Oh my.
I found my Utena game.
I didn't play it.
Was that the Dish game?
No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura.
I can never remember these things.
But there was Clamp involved because I played Rayearth.
And I was going to play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or anything.
Also, I bought Dan's present.
Don't tell him anybody.
It's... That's what Dan got.
I'm not going to repeat that.
I'm not going to tell anybody why I got Dan because they'll tell him because of freaking internet.
People can't keep a secret.
What's up with that?
And then I bathed the cat.
That's a game all in itself.
That's just... See what offended faces Shermie can make at you.
She's asleep in her bed now, but she doesn't... She does look cleaner.
She's a lot cleaner.
She doesn't smell like her ass anymore.
That's a good thing when she's right underneath me.
She doesn't smell like old lady anymore.
All right.
I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like cat old lady.
Comments from chat.orangelontrady.com.
Actdeft in our chat room says, It's officially the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights.
That is true.
Do-do.
Let's see.
Misty says, woo, kid mode.
Sounds good for me.
Right?
Preach it.
I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate last night, that Dan was, the little night song was playing, and I remembered the whole thing.
I was singing along with it.
The other thing I remembered the whole thing of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese.
You know why that is?
What?
Because you're a nerd.
I love this song.
It's a cute song.
All right.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Did you play any old-school Sega?
I, too, broke out the Sega Saturn to play Hanukkah Nights.
It's not quite as popular as Christmas Nights.
But there's eight stages.
Eight stages, and it's a little longer.
So it was pretty good.
No, actually I played lots of Skyrim and ran across my fair share of glitches, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity on Facebook.
I fought a dragon, and all of a sudden it froze for a second, and then this giant dirt thing was in front of me.
We'll have to post it to the Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing down here.
Just to give you an idea of how tall this thing is, it's just ridiculous.
It's like an old faithful made out of dirt.
Yeah, pretty much.
And it is completely non-solid.
You can just run right through it.
I was like, oh, big mountain that it created.
And it's weird.
That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, today I was playing, all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like...
Wait, this is that same dragon I just killed, like, hours ago, days ago.
It just fell from the sky again.
It's so glitchy.
I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple weeks just because of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but I really need to play it more.
God.
Fucking chat.
What?
What did chat do now?
They're making assumptions, so I just said it.
You're dirty.
So, yeah, I mean, I haven't really been doing anything.
I actually had to force myself to go to the next actual quest or the storyline quest.
But along the way, of course, I had to waste a bunch of time and went back to Helgen and...
I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.
I got a dragon flying backwards today.
That's about it.
Yeah, 360.
I was playing on PS3.
I didn't notice any bugs, really.
I'm playing still on the last patch, the 1.1, because I'm not dumb enough to download 1.2.
I'm just like, nope, I'm not going to download that.
I like having magical resistance and stuff like that, and my dragons flying forward.
so I've been playing that and then actually I'm setting up my JTAG to play once I'm done how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can port over the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a JTAG
Which is fantastic.
And so you can do a bunch of cool things with that.
Of course, I'm not doing that right now.
I'm actually just playing legitimately.
Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their belongings, which is never a good idea because I started selling some firewood back to one of the inns or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place.
of everything that was not steel.
And so now people eating, I'm taking your food.
Just all sorts of fun stuff like that.
Awesome.
Hey, you helped them out.
What's theirs is yours.
Exactly.
And then I sold it back to them, which is great.
You can do some mean things in Skyrim.
There's some really funny stuff.
I went to this one fort, and all these bandits were running around.
There was this old woman, and she's like, I come with the fort.
There's people coming and going.
I don't know who's taking over.
One side wins, the other side comes back.
So meanwhile, all these bandits are attacking it, and I'm attacking them.
And she's like, I think you should leave.
And she's following me around saying, I think you should leave.
It was hilarious.
I'm like, I'm going to kill you, bitch.
You keep fucking talking to me.
And then she finally, she's still there, but now the Imperial forces are there.
But it's hilarious, because she's like, these people that have captured her, she's just like, I think you should go.
I'm like, well, no, I'm not going to.
you know the thing Skyrim obviously is doing amazingly well you know and it's a single player game and everything and I notice a lot of what makes single player games really transcend into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like Grand Theft Auto 4 or Grand Theft Auto 3 which while granted they do have their multiplayer modes they're probably more known for their single player I think these games that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable yeah stuff that the people create in the environments and
The Turd Has Its Own Microcosm
Yeah, I really do.
I'm probably going to go back to Saints Row again because I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't have all the achievements yet.
I'm almost there, but I really hated doing the car theft missions and so I didn't.
And then I also had to replay the game as a female character for at least two hours and get that achievement.
And then I had to finish some of the other story missions in a different way than I did before.
But, you know, it's almost at the end.
The other thing I played this week also was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1, you know, Call of Duty 4.
Now we're playing just regular free-for-all deathmatches.
We're going old-school free-for-all deathmatches, which is kind of a little bit like Grand Theft Auto deathmatches where you start off with the same weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along.
So it's kind of fun just mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game eventually.
The problem is, so it's like every time I'm like, okay, I gotta work on the mod game.
or I can play Skyrim and usually Skyrim wins out, you know.
Yeah, I know how it goes.
That game, literally, it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it.
I collect shit.
I hoard it all.
What's your wife's opinion?
Your wife pretty much hates video games.
She's reading books.
She doesn't care.
The only thing I heard out of her like yesterday was, oh, that's pretty.
You know, because, you know, it's the environment and stuff.
It is pretty.
But, like, you know, I attacked a mammoth the other day and stuff.
I killed a couple bears today.
They're pissing me off.
That's right.
Did you find the cave of bears?
Yes, I did find the cave of bears.
Yes.
I don't know if it was... It's right outside one of the quest towns.
It's called, like, Bear Cave or something like that.
Oh.
You go in and it's nothing but bears.
There was two bears in a cave that I found.
I don't think it was that.
It was on my way to... I don't remember the damn town names.
Yeah, I remember it's been a while.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, anything else for your week you want to share?
That's it.
Alright.
My game of the week, actually not quite as exciting as my co-host this week.
I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week.
I wanted to get Mario Kart 7 today, but I neglected to order online, and now that I'm trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it until after Christmas.
I'm like, screw you!
So I want to know, I was literally next door to an evil G today and I still didn't want to go in.
I'm like, I'll wait till I go to Target later in the week.
So yeah, no Mario Kart 7 for me today, but I will get it this week.
Just things are a little bit crazy right now.
As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier, prepping for Thursday and just everything else going on with my day job.
Darkmoon Faire Darkmoon Faire
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
www.hoardhouse.com
You'll have to forgive me, I forgot the name Somebody in chat I'm sure will yell it out But it's the bundle that had Cthulhu, Saves the World It's like a big something bundle I don't know Yeah, and then it had a really Big world bundle maybe?
Yeah, it had a really neat sounding game in it Which between that and the Xbox Live Indie games that I'd played before I knew it would be worth it It was like poker mixed with puzzle game mixed with RPG It sounded really cool So I wanted to play that I just didn't get around to it this week
because, again, new WoW patch, busy day life.
It'd be awesome if it was Swords and Poker for the PC.
It is not Swords and Poker PC.
It's something else.
That was another game that took over my life.
Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't even get the answer for them.
We'll see.
It'll come up in a little while, I'm sure.
See, the problem with those indie bundles is I'm not buying any more until I play the one that I have, and I've only played one game out of it, VVVV.
I still haven't played all the other ones out of that Humble Indie Bundle.
So, yeah, it'll probably be a while before I buy any more of those.
Actually, I was looking a little bit on Xbox Indie Games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet.
And I thought about buying some stuff.
I almost bought DLC Quest.
But then I was like, how often would I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff?
So it'll be something that I...
purchase later on all right thank you guys thank you chat room chat.orangelandradio.com it was Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle it's done that was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it I don't know but it's done so unfortunately you can't buy this now but let's see unless maybe you can now the current minimum is done it says or beat the minimum I don't know what the minimum is
I don't know if you can still buy it but you look down here and it says one minute five seconds ago they were still selling it so I don't think you can let me try four dollars go see if it'll work but anyway it had Breath of Death Cthulhu Saves the World the game I was trying to think of Rune Spell Overture that's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out so there you go and sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore I think it's done so can't get it now
Alright, chat.orange.com if you want to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.
Awesome.
Some other things we want to plug.
Lol, you're old.
Right?
I was talking about this earlier and they were like, no, you're not old.
It's like, no, I'm forgetting things left and right.
A couple other things we wanted to mention before we get into tonight's news.
I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet.
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
You can also send in your questions for tonight because we'll get into Twitter topics a little later in the show when we get into Part B. Our Facebook is there as well.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And now we are also on Google+.
So you can reach out and plus one us.
Just search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google+.
Because there's no URLs on Google right now.
So there you go.
Many ways you can interact with the show and talk to us and say hello.
And thank God there will be a mailbag again next week, hopefully as well, if we're getting the old website back.
So that should be up midweek or so.
All right.
Let's get into some gaming news.
Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight.
Yes, so lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation Vita.
And of course, one of the things that people are wondering is, how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us?
Of course, it's going to be something reasonable, right?
Right?
Right?
No?
Actually, no.
They're pretty high priced.
Or as you might say, not reasonable.
Yes, not reasonable at all.
Apparently, they're saying that according to GameStop, or the Evil G if you will, they have it listed on their website that the 4GB card is going to be $29.99, although they have, I guess, Sony has told some websites that the 4GB cards actually retail for $24.99, 8GB cards for $39.99.
But, but, I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it listed for.
So beyond the 4 and 8 gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will run you $69.99, and 32 will be $119.99.
Why is this important?
Because they're required.
You need to have a memory card to play your games, for the most part.
Most games require the memory card, and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory card in order to do that.
And it's proprietary, so you can't just, you know...
Get an SD card or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper.
But, you know, hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right?
That's what their fear is, or they're going to hack the system somehow.
I can tell you this much, Sony.
They're going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have.
It's just going to happen.
So I have to have a memory card.
And is Sony selling a bundle that includes a memory card?
They're going to have launch bundles or whatever that come with like a two gigabyte one, I think.
Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, oh my God, I can't believe they're releasing the Vita for $250.
That is in fact a lie because $250 doesn't get you a memory card.
Am I correct?
Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah.
But some games do not require it.
Okay.
Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves, and they also have storage for download content and stuff like that.
Some other games require memory cards for that storage as well.
I was going to say, if these stupid things are required, then the system's not really $250, is it?
But because there is that little, you know, we call that a loophole, where it's like, okay, well, really, you can play some games without one, right?
Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360, remember when they first released it?
You don't have to get a hard drive, but, you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever.
But they're a little ridiculous, and I mean, I understand the price of memory.
I'm sorry, that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards.
Especially when everything else is way cheaper.
I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive prices.
I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, you can get a 250GB hard drive for probably about $30 if not cheaper than that and it's just such a high markup and it's not anything really special either it's just a laptop hard drive formatted a special way which you can get any laptop drive and format it that special way if you have the right software to do that
Now, some of our folks in the chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing.
And so like SSJ100Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now upwards from $350.
And Avakan Anagram is like, no, it's $250 plus $25.
You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is nice.
TigerClaw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video player.
And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD Passport thing?
Let me get this right.
If I want to play Luminous old school all over again, assuming it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is, I need to buy the right to get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some of these games on.
Yes.
Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game would just cost me used anyway.
to just play on my old PSP.
Yes.
Logic doesn't apply when it comes to new video games, Rob.
I know.
It's just... It's so interesting to me because what got everybody excited about the Vita?
What truly got everybody like, fuck yeah, Sony Vita!
What got everybody really excited about it?
The price.
The back touch.
It was that price.
No, it was not the back touch.
It was not the reach around.
It was that $250 price.
And now it's kind of like, oh, but it's...
Yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know.
Oh, by the way, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how we were talking last week about Ridge Racer?
There's another thing to lose a little excitement about the Vita over.
Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little bit cheaper than your average PlayStation game.
It's $29.99, whereas your average going cost for a Vita game is going to be $39.99.
So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the game.
Fantastic.
It's awesome.
You know what?
I'm going to save myself $30.
I'm just not going to buy that game.
you know I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am a consumer whore and I want all the new toys but I'm finding myself a little less excited than I was a few months ago I mean at the end of the day it's all about games it is all about the game and if there is a truly like kick ass oh my god blow my mind game on this thing like you know I gotta say Luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic if there's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita then you know
All this stuff seems a little less.
Maybe it's worth waiting.
Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that.
Being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything.
It nets you a bunch of problems and a more expensive price point.
That is it.
What are you going to net?
Oh, I get to play some of these games early.
Well, it's all Generation 1 stuff.
I mean, is there really anything super fantastic?
I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then Uncharted game might be worth it to you.
I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan, but I'm not buying Ridge Racer.
I don't really care about a new LittleBigPlanet game or ports of a bunch of older games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or UFC game, MMA stuff.
I just don't care that they're porting that stuff over right now.
Our chat room is on fire.
It is literally burning with conversation on this whole thing.
Alfcananagram's talking about the bundle.
The PlayStation Vita first edition bundle.
PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, 4 gigabyte card, and little deviants, $349.
God, I sound like a PR dude.
I gotta admit, not all that stuff interests me.
I'm probably gonna want a card more than 4 gigabits and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3G.
Like, I don't need it.
I think they have one that's without the 3G as well but I'm not sure if that's available over here.
I think that's only in Canada.
I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.
Alright, one more comment I'm going to get to here from a private message.
Usually I don't read private messages because I'm like, talk in the main room.
But I'll let Miklatov have this one because he did guest on Horde House earlier today, so he did me a favor.
But anyway, even though he only did a mediocre job.
No, just kidding, just kidding.
I just want to give him to alt tab and say something angry.
Miklatov says, Rumor has it that the memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus retail box.
Yeah, but here's the thing about that.
That's all rumor, and I don't know if that's actually true or not.
And on top of that, all that is is just incentivizing you to buy the more expensive memory card because...
At the end of the day, say you buy a 4GB stick, what's that going to hold?
One or two games?
I mean, that's not going to offset the price of that memory card.
All I have to say is the more and more we talk about all this, and please let that 40% thing be true, because once that news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react?
I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.
The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy, GameStop included.
Well, here's the thing.
How long is it until the Vita comes out in Japan?
I mean, isn't that like right around the corner?
yeah it's like the 17th I thought the price points that they had for games on I don't know if that's just been announced yet but I don't think it's going to be 40% I think it's going to be either the same price or just slightly under not 40% if it is 40% cool then that way maybe it gets more people to buy their games or whatever or people just be more selective in what they buy
All right, let's move on with another story.
This is also about Sony.
I don't know what to think of this news, and I think a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either.
There are rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony.
Ueda.
Ueda, excuse me.
He's quit Sony, and why is this important?
Oh, he's the creative lead behind Team Ico, which is creating The Last Guardian.
Remember The Last Guardian?
Remember that?
That was that game that showed up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good.
And then it was suddenly absent this year.
And yeah, apparently he is left.
The game hasn't come out yet.
Maybe that explains why it was supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not.
Supposedly he is working on the project still.
He's freelancing.
but uh yeah interesting Sony was asked to comment on the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation right okay be interesting to see how that impacts that game especially if they announce it now for the 360 and the Wii U maybe that's the surprise it's on the Wii U Wii U what about the Wii U Loki
Thanks for watching!
It doesn't do anything yet.
It's just a video with some tech demos and shit.
They don't actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that doesn't, but at E3, that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware.
All I'm saying is that if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you Shadow of the Colossus and Ico, comes the last Guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just be like, I don't give a fuck.
This is what you're going to hear in the audience.
They're not gonna... It's not gonna go to any other platform other than Sony.
I guarantee it.
It's not gonna happen.
He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit.
It's not fun to fantasize about.
Who cares?
I mean...
Retail Exclusive
It's not just the game stuff.
I know, but... They said Nintendo of America has said that it's going to be out in April 2012.
But I mean, why... Why not have just already put it out?
It's in English.
It's there.
It's there.
Why wait?
Because, DarkSakura, they have to remove the U's and put the Z's back in.
So what?
So what?
Excuse me, the Z's.
And all the Z's are now Z's.
So maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look nonsensical.
Americans won't understand it.
So yogurt has an H in it.
Is there yogurt in the Xenoblade Chronicles?
I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.
There probably is yogurt.
Just... You know what?
Just for that, I'm still gonna get the British one.
Look.
I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this.
No, I haven't pre-ordered it.
I have until April.
Why pre-order it today?
I don't need to pre-order this.
I do because I really feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to fail?
Have you ever heard that before?
You're setting me up to fail.
At work all the time.
I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying.
It's a very, very thing you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail.
Yes, they do.
We're not a company that sets people up to fail.
Yes, they do.
Okay.
I feel like this game is being set up to fail.
Yeah.
And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic.
I mean, for a Wii game.
At the end of the day, a game is a game.
And even though it's a...
Really, really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game.
It's still a really good RPG that any RPG fan needs to experience.
For real.
I mean, for real.
I mean, so what if it doesn't have the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff?
We pimp classic games here on the show all the time.
It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games in the slightest because this game does a lot.
And, like, seriously, when you do play it, you're like, this is a Wii game?
Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.
And they should!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like Loki said earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox Lube joke because it was a week old.
Well, this game is coming out like years after it came out in Japan at this point, right?
It's got to be at least a year since it's out in Japan.
At least six months from Europe, for sure.
And for what reason, we don't know.
Who already really wanted it has pirated it.
Let me put it this way.
If you're translating from English to English, English, English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week to finish that.
I mean... It's called Find and Replace.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't see how that would be that difficult to go through there.
And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the words that's spelled in English English.
Who cares?
People are going to be able to read it.
And you know what?
Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was misspelled in the first place.
Or it's spelled correctly, but just not in the way that we may spell it correctly.
Who gives a shit?
You can understand it.
So, for one, it's coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it.
So now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's going to be honest about it and actually buy the game if they pirated it?
Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever, at least they haven't said.
I...
Thanks for watching!
I bet it comes out and all that shit is still in there.
I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all.
So, what do you want to bet?
We'll see, we'll see.
But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release thing.
What does this tell you?
If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really going to do a lot of marketing behind this.
You're not going to see Xenoblade TV commercials.
You're not going to see magazine ads really a whole lot.
Maybe onesie twosie here and there.
GameStop might promote it a little bit.
Game Informer will probably have an ad for it.
That's true.
Game Informer will probably have it.
And they are a big magazine.
but it's not going to be quite that campaign you would see behind old say Mario Kart 3DS or you know some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going on right now which it just seems like they're just going to here
Well, it's all about exposing themselves to loss.
History has shown with games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's not going to sell very well.
I mean, look at Mad World, look at even some of the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff.
It just...
It looks good.
It could be really cutting edge as far as the technology behind it or something like that.
Or it can be really edgy.
It's like a violent game and stuff.
But people can hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell.
And unfortunately, for Nintendo to publish this and to bring it over here, it's a risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing money.
They're not doing any marketing, but spend some money on another Mario Kart game or another Mario game that they know they're going to sell millions of copies of.
But at the same time, they want to not lose all their cred with hardcore gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer.
At least that's what they're trying to
This is how they're skewing it right now.
Ninja Gaiden is going to be on.
There's a Ghost Recon game that's going to be on.
It's going to have all these publishers backing it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want the hardcore games to come back.
all this makes me miss working designs
GameGuru GameStop probably paid for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive.
I don't know.
I worry at the end of the day it's not going to sell as much as it should.
And then Nintendo's going to say, well, this is why you can't have nice things.
We were gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall and it didn't sell.
So no last story for you.
Goodbye.
Here's why I say that.
Fuck them.
Because you know what?
I don't need them to bring out fucking RPGs.
They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want.
Because guess what?
This world has multiple publishers.
It's full of publishers that bring out RPGs like Atlus or Exceed or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs.
And guess what?
I don't need you to fucking bring over anything.
You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports games, your stupid...
If there's another goddamn game with Woohoo Island in it, I don't give a fuck if Woohoo Island is in there.
It's not a landmark.
It's not something like, oh my god, there's islands in here.
It's such a character, as they put it.
I don't fucking care.
Hey, why don't you put Woohoo Island in fucking Xenoblade or whatever, because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are going to want to see that.
And hell, Mario is a playable character, since it's a Nintendo published game.
It's got to have fucking Mario in it.
Mamma mia.
So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't brain out over here.
And if they're like, well, see, we listened to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through.
Well, fuck you.
You know what?
Because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit, and sure, people are going to cream themselves over goddamn Zelda.
And to be fair... I was going to say, hold on.
Hold on.
Because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward Sword...
Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing.
I haven't played it myself.
But that Mario 3DS game, I will tell you firsthand, is that good?
Okay.
To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy.
It's not a Xenoblade.
It's a different type of game.
It's an adventure game, if you will.
It's not an RPG.
It's an adventure game.
and so on.
Thanks for watching!
And then they never did it again.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They did it once in Endless Ocean.
But who gives a fuck?
No one bought Endless Ocean.
It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game.
If I want to go snorkeling, I will go outside and go snorkeling.
I don't need to play a game to simulate that.
But that was like the two times that they ever used that stupid SD memory card slot for anything other than later on.
This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?
it's because they do stupid shit because now everyone's like oh look look Project Rainfall worked no no they did it so they could save face so they're like see we care about the hardcore gamer buy the Wii U we're gonna put out hardcore games for it then you buy the Wii U and you're gonna get fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more Mario games oh and there's gonna be a Zelda there because you know that's a hardcore game now and maybe a Metroid that's gonna suck
I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting.
And RDGSinge in our chatroom says, The new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year.
I'm not sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you can read into it.
And it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games?
And I think you can, but certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about?
And I gotta say...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That was all anybody could talk about.
Nobody shared the stage.
That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good games.
And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever, and some other good Wii games.
But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or sold their Wii because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to play anymore.
Where is my Wii?
You know, so it's like, well, who cares?
And also, Skyward Sword, one system.
Skyrim, on a bunch of systems and PCs.
So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking about it.
But once again, RPG, adventure game.
Different.
Completely different.
Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.
Yeah, it's definitely not for Grandma.
I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal to a lot of people.
And to be honest, I mean, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind of a risky move for them.
I mean, if you think about it, they're...
Their big thing was let's get non-gamers into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.
Yeah, but there's a problem.
They were non-gamers for a reason.
They don't play games.
And yeah, they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii Party didn't sell very well because no one buys games that are non-gamers.
Mario may have sold well for some of the stuff because, once again, you're convincing them it's a party game, but Skyward Sword, not a party game, not really anything that non-gamers are going to be interested in.
It is kind of...
Hey fans of the series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey we're still considering you and it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform but
At the same time, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever, I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care.
I'm not going to buy it.
Especially when they said GameStop only, I'm really not going to buy it.
I gotta be honest.
Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April.
I am leaning towards, I think I might buy it.
It's a good game at the end of the day despite my displeasure of how they're fucking this up.
I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein that DarkSakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on.
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a piece of gaming history.
We have almost everything that Working Designs put out.
Same thing.
It's kind of one of those things for me.
and yeah, I don't give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. They'll use probably the touchpad for some other goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for.
Whatever.
I don't care.
Yeah, I may get in on 3DS, but I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that has all these classic tracks.
What if the Mario game is really good?
Like Mario 3DS Land or whatever the hell it's called.
Super Mario 3D Land.
Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo
and a lot of games have sold me the systems you know Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation but and there's a lot of Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation there was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii but you know what I bought the Wii and I played some of those games and haven't really touched it since played a little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back but I mean I kind of was like it's kind of a waste of my money
And I don't want to make that mistake again Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on But I'm sure we'll get lots of emails on it this week Oh wait, you can't email us Actually no, the email should be fixed mid-week So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, we've got more news to cover So I'm going to go back to Loki
Alright, so let's see here, let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool, and I actually had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind of reinvigorated it.
There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which I'm not too familiar with those games,
Because they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.
But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware.
And EA, I guess they've given, they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high quality RPG titles to a fast growing, highly engaged core gamer crowd.
And they're also saying, you know, planning on bringing stuff to, you know, social platforms like Facebook and stuff.
So maybe seeing like Bioware games on Facebook and stuff.
Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there.
Well, I've been seeing it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook, too.
Yeah, so more like that type of game.
Because that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.
And so it's BioWare Sacramento now.
That's kind of cool.
Yeah, because that's where we, if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered is in Sacramento.
I did a little investigative journalism, if you will.
I just want to figure out where these guys are located.
I want to know if they were downtown or if they were like a suburb.
Well, do you know where they are downtown?
I found this fascinating.
I actually, because their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is.
And so I Googled it and put it in the maps.
Guess what they are next door to?
The Depot Oh, fun Do you know what The Depot is, our international audience?
It's the gay bar downtown The gay bar It's right at the corner of where all the gay bars are down there I think it's hilarious, Bioware Sacramento Bioware is now officially next door to a gay bar
It's just whatever.
But it's just kind of funny because, you know, especially BioWare has also been kind of one of the leading companies in kind of breaking down that barrier in a lot of their storytelling, too.
You know, obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff.
Alan's tried and they've got positions on the website.
And I think a lot of it's like design stuff, too.
So you really should.
You should look into that.
So, in fact, we should...
Gosh, now there's gaming companies starting to pop up here.
There's us.
There's BioWare Sacramento.
There's the Prima Games people are actually here too, the strategy guys that come out of there.
We need to have a luncheon.
Maybe a short luncheon.
Hi, two people.
We need to rent out the back room at the Spaghetti Factory, which is across the street from BioWare Sacramento.
Sacramento's not on the website yet.
No, but go to their old name.
The ClickNation or whatever, it's on there.
But a lot of that's probably changed.
Oh, yeah.
I applied with them before as ClickNation.
Yeah, yeah.
There you go.
A little more gaming moving into our backyard.
That's pretty cool.
All said and done.
Good luck to them.
I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but especially with... Here's where I could see this going.
A lot of people are very excited about The Old Republic, which Bioware is a part of.
If they can find the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think they'll be a step ahead of Warcraft.
Because World of Warcraft...
Yeah, they've kind of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great.
They just kind of publish like, hey, my character got this achievement.
And hey, look at this 3D model of my character.
And it always seems to break whenever there's a new patch.
So, you know, Blizzard has not been interfacing with Facebook very well.
So this is a chance where BioWare could maybe get a step up.
So who knows if these will be the guys to do it or not.
So pretty cool.
Fun stuff going on in the backyard.
All right.
Moving on.
Lots of reports coming out of Black Friday sales.
Of course, Black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.
because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day.
And now some of the sales numbers are in.
Apparently...
and Loki will love this following up with the rants he was just saying there.
Nintendo of America in an interview with USA Today mentioned that Super Mario 3D Land has become the fastest selling portable Mario game ever.
Mario Land on the Game Boy Mario Advance
So whatever, it is the fastest selling game ever.
It moved half a million copies since November 13th.
3DS system sales are up, way up too.
System sales up 325% for the week of November 20th.
Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.
The Wii had its biggest Black Friday ever.
Half a million systems sold on Black Friday alone.
They needed that because they were not selling well at all.
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, 535,000 copies, fastest selling Zelda in history.
There you go.
Lots of stuff coming out of Nintendo.
Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too.
They moved almost a million Xbox 360s on the week of Black Friday.
They don't say specifically Black Friday, but like just under a million 360s.
750,000 connects that same week.
I'm kind of surprised that the Kinect had such a huge year.
There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on at the Kinect right now, except maybe like Dance Central 2 is cool.
There's a lot of games out for the Kinect, though.
A lot of games out.
A lot of garbage.
Not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are out.
But there's some good stuff.
I had a giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox website because they're like, Kinect for core, like as in hardcore gamers, and they have like a picture of Forza on there.
I'm like, because it has head tracking, it has some voice commands, that's hardly a Kinect game.
and Just Dance 3 which is a Kinect game but this is a franchise that was really popular on the Wii between November 20th and 26th Just Dance 3 sold 700,000 copies lots ABBA You Can Dance no sales figures on that just right now but I'm telling you I didn't talk about that game the other week it's fabulous
Oh, Rob.
DarkSakura watched me play Abba, You Can Dance on the Wii.
I did.
It was the gayest thing I've ever seen.
There was a song where- It's really something.
There was a song where- You gotta see it.
You gotta see it.
They have a ballerina.
Yeah.
And Rob was trying to go in point.
You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs, and it has a little ballerina on the screen, so you have to do little ballerina dances.
It's hilarious.
Wasn't that Fernando?
I think it was The Winner Takes It All or something.
It was Fernando.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Whatever.
No, it's The Winter Takes It All, I think.
That was it.
That was when we had to do the hand sweepy thing.
Yeah.
Anyhow.
I have blurry photos of Rob.
I have blurry photos of Rob.
That better not end up on the internet.
I will destroy you.
I'm going to call you Dance Squatch.
You know, because every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.
Shush.
Alright, let's move on with some release dates.
We're going to travel around the world and check out games coming out soon, although it's probably dried up quite a bit moving past Black Friday now.
Yeah, it's usually December is quite a dead month.
In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are probably going to be just a couple titles.
But this week we had Mario Kart 7, well today, that's on the 3DS.
Fortune Street coming out on the Wii this week.
Jaws Ultimate Predator on the Wii and 3DS.
FaceRacer's photo finish on the 3DS NanoAssault on the 3DS Ubisoft is releasing their own tablet thing to compete with UDraw the Drawsome tablet that's coming out on the Wii
Yeah, it's awesome.
Outdoors Unleashed, Africa and Alaska coming out on 3DS.
Just Dance 3 on the PlayStation 3, finally coming out for the PlayStation Move.
The Adventures of Tintin, the game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and the 3DS.
I care about 1010 You know the game will be garbage The game doesn't look like garbage It's actually kind of a neat little adventure game I don't know what I'm talking about Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait Interruption Amiga 777 says it's been reported that Famitsu confirmed a Kinect remake of Blue Stinger Ooh Okay Formula 1 2011 for the 3DS The Oregon Trail for the Wii and 3DS this week
Hell yeah.
I think my Wii died of dysentery.
Actually, I think that's why I haven't played it.
And I believe that is it.
Alright, then let's move on to Japan and talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there.
This week on December the 8th on the Xbox 360, Dragon Ball Z, Ultimate Blast, Connect Disneyland Adventures, Michael Jackson The Experience.
Boy, that game's been out here a while, but you're finally getting it in Japan this week in regular and limited editions.
And the Elder Scrolls Skyrim comes out in Japan this week.
I can't imagine...
They've localized everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the menus and things.
I don't know, but that's interesting.
They are bringing that out in Japan.
By the way, next week, huge release, Final Fantasy XIII 2.
This is Japan, again.
I know we're getting it early next year.
PlayStation 3 on December the 8th, Beyond the Future Fix, The Time Arrow in regular and limited edition, Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Blast, Michael Jackson The Experience, Need for Speed The Run, Japan's edition, as well as the Elder Scrolls Skyrim there as well.
They actually did all the voice acting stuff in Japanese.
Did they really?
Yeah.
That's a lot.
They have a trailer that shows it.
I think it was on Kotaku they were saying, which language trailer is the most epic?
and they had Japanese and German and French and a whole bunch of stuff.
I'm searching the YouTubes right now.
Let's see.
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Japan trailer.
I better not get trolled with this YouTube link.
Let's see.
We are live, folks.
Let's see.
If the world has come to an end, let's enjoy it.
I'm feeling moved already.
I don't know about you guys.
There's not a lot of talking.
God, this game is really good.
I actually do have to say that that's an example of the Japanese voice acting.
It sounds really good.
They could be reading this in pig Latin and I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic!
Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire thing, but there you go.
Wow, I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.
So props to them.
That's really something else.
All right, also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Wizardry Perfect Pack comes out this week.
That's a role-playing game.
I wonder if that ties into the old-ass Wizardry series from back in the day.
It probably does.
Let's see.
On other systems, the PlayStation Vita, not out just yet.
That is December 17th.
But otherwise, anything on the Wii this week?
Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games And Michael Jackson The Experience and Need for Speed The Run All the versions on the Wii are out this week as well Let me check the 3DS lastly real quick Ah, World Soccer Winning 11 2012 Soccer games are usually pretty big over there And, looks like on a special release day, the 10th of December This might be slightly a big deal Monster Hunter 3G
That's right, the Monster Hunter 3DS game is out People are going to be piled outside waiting for it Yep, that's slightly a big deal Side of people who will be in line Yeah Freaking Monster Hunter Alright Two games in the UK Alright, what?
On the 9th, Dizzy Prince of Yolk Folk on the iPhone and Android And Just Dance 3 for PlayStation 3 There you go
DarkSakura, more gaming news please.
Well, I don't know if Alan knows about this.
He does.
I trolled him with it already.
Well, a Valve employee was spotted wearing a Half-Life 3 shirt.
And the person that took the picture, Chandana...
and Ekenayake, I think that's how it's pronounced, asked permission to take the picture too and put it on his Twitter.
So it's a big Half-Life logo with the three.
Yeah.
Thanks for watching!
This whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling, but I hope it's true.
I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true, but the problem is it could also be a joke.
I mean, is this something that Valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce?
They probably would want to show off the new engine, obviously, because it would be a new engine.
I'd imagine so.
I guess if it's real, maybe something early next year?
Because, you know, what else is Valve working on right now that we know of?
The Dota game.
That's about Dota 2 or whatever.
I'm going to put the picture up on our Tumblr.
All right.
And Salacious Popper, Alan, is in our chat right now saying, shaking and crying, shaking and crying.
I'm there with you.
I hope it's true.
A lot of people will be very happy.
If it's true, then I'll need new underwear.
All right.
Valve, try to give us all a little bit of warning.
All right.
Loki.
All right.
So let's see here.
This is kind of annoying, I guess.
You remember how some of these publishers are doing online passes?
Well, EA, being the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's right.
Apparently, there is a guy that was part of the Neo Games Are Fun forum, and he posted that his copy of EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit contained the online pass that was expired, blocking him from accessing online content.
And I guess there's a bunch of other people that were saying that they ran into the same problem.
EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly.
Dragon Age 2 has an online pass that expires March 31, 2012.
Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement, it's actually listed in there.
It says redownloading or getting a new pass is free.
EA said, I'm not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the old pass and it somehow changes the date or something.
Um, and it's weird though, that they have,
Wait for it?
Wait for it?
Do I really need to say anything else?
I mean...
Yeah, I just don't understand why they would do that in the first place.
I mean, that would be like, for example, if you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically these passes act like download content, and it expires.
Hey!
Hey, you know you like playing that Skyrim DLC.
Hope you finished all your quests in it, because it's expired.
Unfortunately, we made it out of meat.
It's no good anymore.
You can't consume this download content.
You will get sick.
I mean, it's just... I know, I know.
What else needs to be said?
It's just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting punished over and over again.
And it's like, when is this shit going to stop?
oh and they even said that apparently Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and it even says on the actual card it says was it the service network whatever activation and it says code expires January 1st 2012 so if you're planning on buying Mass Effect 2 I hope you use that code already SMH that's all I have to say SMH
Moving on.
You know, wait, no, not moving on.
You know, in California, we have this law, and I think some other states have it too, and the federal has certain protections about it, but if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate to the movie theater for his birthday, and he never uses it, but like three years later he finds it, it's still worth $25.
They can't deduct fees, so...
if he wants to take it in for certain amounts I think it's like up to $10 or $25 he can actually go in and say I want the cash back then they have to give him the money for it like they have to do that so it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole kind of around this where things that are worth money like this can expire I'm going to tell you something else though in the state of California gift cards don't expire oh yeah yeah
So why does this stuff expire?
I don't think it actually legally would be able to in this state.
See, but it's not real money.
The online pass technically has no value.
It does and it doesn't.
To me, it seems like a legal loophole.
The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it.
But you've still bought the pass.
You've still bought the card.
But you didn't really buy the pass.
It was included with your new game.
It still has a monetary value attached to it.
The game has a monetary value.
No, the pass actually does have a monetary value.
But you didn't buy the pass, you bought the game.
I don't agree.
I don't agree with what I'm saying.
I'm just being their lawyer.
No, but it's nothing that would stand.
Thanks for watching!
Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these online passes that you happen to throw in their way guess what you can download any DLC for free now granted if you know Mass Effect 2 or whatever that's not a big deal and you can't play online with you know a JTAG system or something like that but you can download all that download content
For example, Saints Row the Third.
If you're ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend that may have a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version of that online pass download content that works just fine.
Of course, legitimate consumers that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what?
THQ wants to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares.
or they can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle.
It's just a little minor inconvenience, I guess.
I mean, and does it stop some used game sales?
Maybe it does.
I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like that.
It's not the way.
The sequel to Tiny Tower, tiny text.
It's not the way to go about it.
I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January.
Let's say they go and buy it in January and they got this code.
Hey, sweet, I can get this free download content.
And you go put in code invalid.
It's expired.
I mean, wouldn't that kind of leave a little sour taste in your mouth once you think twice before buying an EA product again?
And let's just say they bought it.
Brand new.
Because, I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.
Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet, and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.
I mean, that would kind of annoy me.
That would be like, maybe... What?
You should have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier!
I mean, thanks!
What I think it comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of when they're going to drop prices of these things, and you see they work in the price of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60.
Oh, now we're going to drop it down to $20, and we're going to take the download vote.
No, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually.
I think you're giving them too much credit to plan ahead.
I think that's exactly what happened here, is that people didn't plan ahead.
And I think that's what's really happening here, is this...
Somebody put the cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well, what about when these things expire?
And then when that point came up, somebody just said, ah, fuck them.
So that's what happens in boardrooms across America.
Fuck them!
Moving on.
Verizon.
I wanted to say fuck them too.
Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon, but if not, well, fuck them too.
But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about Verizon, because this sounds like it could be interesting.
You know that whole streaming TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360?
Well, Verizon Fios, I don't know what that is, because we don't have this here.
I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse, that type of thing?
It's F-I-O-S, it's...
FiberOptic Okay Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels from this to your Xbox 360 If you're an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get the Fios TV and Internet service So in other words, as long as you can just turn on your TV and get these channels Now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have Gold as well And you'll get 26 of the channels
I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome, but everybody's reporting on it anyway.
No, I'm with you, because as far as... Oh, you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect.
I don't care.
That's something your TV can't do.
Once again... Xbox!
P-break!
Once again, why do I need to do that?
Okay, I'm telling you, in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote faster than someone can say, pause.
I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference there.
Xbox, pause.
Did you ask for a puppy?
No, Xbox, pause.
You want to watch Jaws?
Xbox, pause!
It's just... Cannot identify you.
Please face sensor.
You're not old enough to watch this programming.
Uh, I mean, here's the thing.
I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for stuff in addition to my cable company.
Or, like, for example, say, if I'm ever so inclined to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point?
If I have to have cable to watch TV...
I'm going to do it without an Xbox.
I don't need to buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV.
Chat room to the rescue.
The show where every gamer has a voice.
Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this.
Alpha Kanatagram in the chat.
If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one.
Something for the kids room.
Loki, witty retort.
I can just get another box and okay that's great that's great we can do that I suppose but at the same time I mean I only watch TV in one room I don't need that what about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV in his room
Then he can watch TV in his room.
Because by then I'm sure we'll have something better than the Xbox streaming.
Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream cable, we got a problem.
I mean, hell, you can get like dish installed like four receivers or whatever.
I'm not going to do that.
Like they always say, but we can install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms.
I'm like...
I'm only one person.
I can watch TV in one room at a time.
I don't need four receivers.
Why am I going to watch?
Hey, wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.
You know what?
I have the internet.
Fuck receivers.
I'm already paying for a high-speed internet.
That's my DVR.
I can watch shit whenever I want on any system.
And I like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your iPod and stuff.
Well, first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small until you watch a TV show on my iPod.
But, um...
DarkSakura.com
Um, so they're of course not going to do that.
So, watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal.
Now, here's the thing though that would interest me, is if they're in HD, because I currently don't pay for the HD package, because I chose to go the, I was actually going to go the route of no cable, but they said, hey, for two dollars extra we can give you cable, and I'm like, okay, two bucks, I can do that.
Two dollars.
but it's actually the additional stuff on top of it like channels that are not on my TV that I'm interested in like if they have gaming channels or something like that ESPN Ocho the Ocho if they have additional stuff that's kind of what I'm interested in as far as the stuff that's offered from Verizon or Dish or DirecTV or whatever or maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently powered on how about that wouldn't that be something
You know what?
JD Ross.
JD Ross is not working.
Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.
Think about it.
Could be the Major Nelson hour.
Could be the Major Nelson channel.
Just camera fixed on Major Nelson all day long.
Major's miniseries, maybe.
DarkSakura, we need another news story, please.
Animal Crossing!
This one's actually kind of different.
Yeah, they say that now, but... You actually play as the mayor, and you can customize your town, and you have a secretary.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now I'm the mayor?
Now you're the mayor.
Do people have to do what I say?
Probably.
You also have a secretary named Shizu.
and the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently too and your clothes you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts so now that I'm the mayor will I be able to evict Tom Nook
I wish.
Will you have to deal with problems?
Will all the animals start occupying on your front lawn?
Is that going to happen?
Am I going to have to send out Resetti to mace the villagers of the town?
Can I finish my story, Rob?
I'm a hands-on mayor.
I'm going to take this shit in my own hand.
Grab the shovel!
Get the bug net and it's time to discipline people.
Can I finish feeding my story, Rob?
No.
Okay.
Rob's shaking and crying.
He's looking forward to this so much.
I just wish somebody other than Nintendo would make these games because then they might be really funny.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Ooh.
And you can actually exchange house designs with people through street pass.
Like a model home view is what it is.
Oh, Loki, you know what this means.
You draw cocks on them.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Tom Nook has left his store.
He has a new job.
He's the town's real estate agent.
Tom Nook's a little asshole.
No wonder the housing market's screwed.
I just want Toto KK to be awesome in it forever.
Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over Animal Crossing.
Occupy Nooks I'm just like, really?
Fuck Nook, I'm switching to a credit union Hey, you can design your own couch cushions I don't fucking care Well, I'm looking, oh wow Actually, your little character looks a lot different I thought those real people were It's like, wow, that's realistic Some Japanese dude No, what's sad is they're trapped in your little town And they have to sing and dance for you to get out
DarkSakura.com
That's okay, we had a Japanese trailer earlier.
This can't possibly be any worse.
The people actually do look quite a bit different.
The little characters.
So this is the developer roundtable.
This is kind of boring.
When do we see the people?
It's like peppered throughout the video.
That video is about as exciting as Animal Crossing is on the second day.
Hey!
I'm probably gonna get it in a 3DS.
Let's move on, Loki.
Well, unfortunately, it is the end of GamePro.
They're going to cease publication altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly.
It will be their last issue.
And basically, the website is shutting down tomorrow on the 5th.
And they're done.
So...
Can I say something about that real quick?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
GamePro, yeah, you know, it was great back in the day when the internet wasn't around.
Unfortunately, now everything is digital and print magazines, unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store, then you're not going to do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives...
You really have to buy them or somehow leverage them out of these companies.
And most of the stuff that may be in your magazine is already a month old by the time everything rolls around.
It's tough.
You've got to figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time-sensitive material.
And that's tough because that's what people want.
That's why RetroGamer is a great magazine because you're not expecting to see new stuff in there.
Yeah.
Anyhow, interesting comment from GameGuru in the chatroom I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no gaming magazine besides PC Gamer My favorite magazine right now is actually Retro Gamer It's a British magazine that's all old video games Oh, the one I just mentioned?
Retro Gamer is a very, okay, and keep in mind, my career, what I want to make a career of is print publication.
And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort into it.
Print it on nice, glossy stock.
Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should warn you, it's going to be rough.
I gotta tell you guys about this gaming magazine that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games in there it's a magazine called Retro Gamer I don't know if you've heard of it shut up
Thank you for watching!
They're having a lot of overlap with their sister site, IndieGames.com.
And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of the best material out there as being indie related, they're just going to kind of focus mainly on IndieGames.com.
Also, mainstream game blogs are doing a much better job nowadays, including The Weirder and Alt Links and among the other gaming news.
Yeah, I think a lot of these gaming websites, to be honest, nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.
Oh, hey, one game blog covered it.
Let me cover it as well.
I mean, Kotaku, I read you daily.
And JoySick, you know.
Kotaku, I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny.
How many videos can I watch of someone spawning cheese and having to roll it down a hill?
I mean, yeah, it's funny the first time.
That's funny.
But I don't need to see that every single time.
But, you know, I...
I don't know.
Yeah, there's a lot of sites out there for getting your news.
Kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know, why we don't really cover a lot of the news.
Because, I mean, really, do you need another source for, you know, website news?
Well, no, we do talk about news.
Well, we do.
Just to have some lols.
To have some lols.
I mean, once again, it's all about, hey, we all have day jobs in our own lives and stuff.
Once again, we're not going to be there right away unless we have some sort of scoop on something, which is not very often because we're not doing this professionally.
that it's impossible for anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that.
We're just a few people and we just can't do it.
We concede.
Alright.
Moving on.
Since Loki talked about how much he sees Skyrim information oversaturating the internet, let's talk about Skyrim.
And Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out this week.
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
And apparently...
Oh, not doing too good.
It's kind of buggy.
A lot of users are reporting various issues are going on with the game.
Apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance.
That could be an issue.
Think about it.
Yeah, the bug list is quite funny actually down at the bottom there.
This here?
Unofficial bug list.
Oh, let me look at that.
Just mentioning some of the things.
Alright, let's look at this.
Oh, is this like, oh, somebody actually posted this on their own forums, good lord.
Well, it's actually the Bethesda forums.
Yeah, but this isn't Bethesda that posted this.
No, it's an unofficial list.
Yikes.
Let's see, the Dark Brotherhood Cal does not show a face mask, only seems to work for females, but doesn't show up for males.
Oh, where's the funny stuff?
Characters getting stuck running.
You know, obviously the resistance is not being there.
Dragons flying backwards.
Or erratic.
Destruction trainers are not letting me train.
Markarth guards always try to arrest the player.
Invisibility is being undone by the Shadow Warrior perk.
Oh, this is a funny one.
One of my coworkers was telling me about he was playing and I guess one of his followers died.
I think it might have been Lydia.
She's the first, well, not really the first follower, but the one you get appointed to by the Jarl.
So apparently she got smashed by a troll, no, a giant.
She got smashed by a giant.
Well, she didn't die, she kind of resurrected herself, but she was still flat.
And so she slithered around like a snake for about eight hours in-game.
And...
and then he was telling me also later on in the game like another person had died and so he's getting married or whatever and like everybody keeps like walking this is just an outrage this is disgusting this bride keeps like storming off and stuff like that he kept reloading and saying what the hell is going on I can't fucking understand what's going on looks down there's the corpse from the person that died like days ago this is like somehow teleported to your wedding he wanted to come see it that's hilarious
Patches in the future
My friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a dead monk in a jail cell, except he looked like he was spasming all over the place.
All right, LOL, Skyrim's buggy, we get it.
Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy.
I mean, as great as a game as Skyrim is, jeez, it's kind of buggy.
And, you know, we didn't... Remember when they couldn't patch games?
Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?
Oh, you mean like on the Wii?
And if you were gonna patch them, you just released a new game.
We're going to take a step back to simpler times.
Maybe it's a Wii game this week apparently since now that's a classic gaming system.
It's not a Wii game.
It's a classic game of the week.
The classic game is a game that I've actually done the full version of before but I haven't done this specifically.
So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas Nights.
My family tradition, damn it.
So, basically, you fly around, collect balls, put them in the idea cap machine, and go fight a boss.
Yay.
What?
Nothing, just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees that put the balls in for the family guy jokes.
I never saw it.
Anyway, with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December 1996 in Japan.
It came with the Christmas Saturn bundle.
Everywhere else, it was given away with the purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Raid Heroes, and Next Generation Magazine.
Um...
It actually, though, if you got the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't have a slipcover.
It just had a transparent one.
But it has its own little special cover.
In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this.
It got its own jewel case and everything.
Sucks.
So with this one, it has the full version of one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley.
But both Claris and Elliot can play through it.
Elliot couldn't in the full game.
And he has a different layout than Clarissa's one.
His is actually a little harder.
So basically, the way the story goes is that they notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in the center of town.
So they go into Nightopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.
At any rate, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it.
In November and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition.
Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition, but it changed to Winter Nights.
In December, it becomes Christmas Nights.
and then the entire area that you go through instead of being all spring-timey turns into wintery places and the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.
You have presents everywhere.
The music, as you can hear, is like a different version of Jingle Bells.
Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it's really fun and cool.
Now the other neat stuff that happens is that the weather in Spring Valley will change depending on the hour and then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's Day where instead of playing Knights you play as Vialla which is pretty cool.
It also has a ton of hidden goodies in it like one of the things that we unlocked last night
Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams
and you fight a bouncy ball version of Robotnik slash Eggman.
And the music is a remix version of Final Fever which was the final boss music from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD.
As I'm sure I've mentioned before, they changed the US music.
So it's really neat.
It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.
There's even a karaoke mode so you can sing the little theme song.
It's really fun.
It was a freebie, which was even better.
This is back in the day when they would do nice shit for us.
Don't you remember?
I do.
So that's your classic game is Christmas Nights.
Ho, ho, ho.
There it is.
There you go.
Yeah.
Christmas night.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
So time appropriate.
I appreciate that.
We're going to take a quick break, guys, but when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced this past week that's going to be lulzy.
A special email bag.
Somebody managed to get an email in anyway, even though the email's down.
We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.
And another game going free to play.
We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show.
This show's been going on a long time, I just want to point out.
Every time you say the 37th, I want to go in a row.
So during the break, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays.
And some folks were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas?

and then we'd go to family stuff to eat free food and we're doing stuff with now Alan and I are doing stuff with Alan's side of the family but I don't know when that'll be done we might be done by I seem to remember last year we were kind of out of there by like 4 or 5 so we'll see but I don't want to rush it so I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not probably
Probably not, but never say never, right?
I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and eat it live on air.
It would be fun to do, have a Chinese food Christmas special, but we'll see.
Anyhow, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not, you guys.
The good news is the next week should be easy, so we'll have one week off for the holidays, and that should be it.
We'll let you know more about that in the next couple weeks Because believe it or not, Christmas is only about three weeks away from today So, yikes!
Alright, Jester Scott in our chatroom says Take a day off, peeps!
That's true, we deserve a day off That's what we're getting for the holidays, a day off Let's go to Disneyland
Don't even tempt me.
All right.
We're going to get back into some more gaming news.
Your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets.
Make sure you get your tweets in because especially since the email bag's been down this week, we're really relying on your tweets.
So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
We don't have quite as much news.
This half of the show, as we did in the first half of the show, so we definitely need your calls and tweets tonight.
Do we have a work injury?
What's going on?
DarkSakura says she has a splinter.
Go take care of it!
I have a splinter!
Alright, go do what you need to do.
Loki will read some news.
We'll take care of it.
Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.
I'll do the news, I guess.
So let's talk a little bit about...
Zynga.
And apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of a franchise with Angry Birds in it.
Apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for a $2.25 billion acquisition from Zynga.
So that's a lot of pride right there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Tell us about that role-playing game that's coming out very soon.
If you can load up the story here, if it'll work.
All right.
Sweet.
Let's talk a little bit about... This is great.
South Park.
They've had a lot of okay games, and then, of course, they have to go and...
and DarkSakura's bleeding, apparently.
No, um... And now it's come out... I was gonna say something nasty, but I didn't.
Thank God, I... I appreciate that you did not say anything.
I was gonna take it there, and then I said, you know what, I'm not gonna take it there.
That would explain a lot about why she's so upset.
Rob, you know what?
I know that Alan would really like for you to come home eventually.
South Park, you were saying?
Yeah, South Park.
Well, they have an Xbox Live Arcade game, the kind of side-scroller co-op game that's South Park's Tenement's Revenge, which is coming out a little bit later on.
But this isn't what we're talking about.
We're talking about what was revealed from the new cover of Game Informer.
Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company that can get exclusives.
We'll see you next time.
Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
And, uh, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they also have, uh, some details out about it.
Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about you fitting in, I guess.
And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be completely customizable.
Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff like that.
Um...
and I think it's pretty awesome looking.
They're saying it's going to combine a bunch of different things.
The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.
The weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from 7.
Also, they're saying that, of course, the entire game is going to be 2D or at least look hand-drawn, I guess.
I gotta say, I'm a little worried, though, because the other South Park games that have come out today have been kind of crappy.
Granted, this is a new company doing this.
Like, who did the Nintendo 64 one?
That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it?
And that one, that was that first-person shooter.
It really wasn't that good.
So, I mean, you know, there's been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live Arcade games, like, you know, there's the Let's Play Tower Defense and all that stuff.
It's good that it has their input.
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm excited.
I'd buy it.
I'll definitely check that out.
I mean, you know, the demo and so forth is very important.
But it's so funny that South Park is still going after all these years.
I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons, too.
God, The Simpsons has been on forever.
The Simpsons is still going.
But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of college.
That was, what, 97?
And it's still on the air?
And people talk about, boy, South Park is so old.
Which means I'm so old.
Rob, I'm older than you.
I was talking about Kinect for PC.
I think so, but I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week, so here's the deal.
Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect, and Kinect 2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected, right?
More high-def cameras, all you really need, and maybe a better microphone in there, I don't know, or higher sound sampling.
but apparently it's going to have some other technical stuff in it as well it's going to be able to read lips it will be able to detect the direction that you're facing and recognize your emotional state
DarkSakura.com
Well, look, a lot of this is just what?
A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device.
The fact that it would be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising.
It was stuff that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough camera resolution.
It didn't have the power!
Hmm.
Hmm.
you know the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing I mean especially for what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth or folks you know that it's going to be really neat I think kind of like it's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now like when they showed FaceTime for the first time and how like deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of like have phone calls so it's pretty awesome so it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up in that regard that's cool yeah very cool
It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.
All right, we're going to go to our email bag.
Now, here's the thing.
We don't really have a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week.
I would say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, hordehouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning.
And one of our special guests, all the way from the other side of the pond, Sil, beat me on Skype and said...
DarkSakura.com
Oh shit, that's right, you need mailbag music.
We also love Syl and we'll do whatever she wants.
I mean really at the end of the day, right?
Syl is my hero.
That's right.
Email!
Hello, guys.
I'm so sorry for what happened to the website, and I hope it will all be resolved quickly.
Now, I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet, but it seriously made me facepalm, and I'm not even giving anybody the address because it's retarded.
It's called Mario Kills Tanuki.
It's on the PETA website.
If you really want to find it, find it, but I don't care.
It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving, so I think a lot of people heard of this.
I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end, points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our inner beings and morals.
I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game I never felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat.
What is your feeling about what PETA did here?
I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing up Shermie now and taking measurements.
Then I haven't said anything.
Love the show, Zil.
I love Zil.
First of all, Shermie...
What the hell is that ringtone?
My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is Bitches by Mindless Self-Indulgence.
Okay.
Apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now.
First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.
It's a bullshit organization.
They put more animals to sleep, or I should just say they murder more animals than they help.
Their second in command, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, their second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal-derived insulin.
Just saying.
Their main leader is a sociopath who basically has stated that she would rather all humanity die.
and have the world ruled by animals.
So I'm just throwing that out there.
She's crazy.
Aw, but animals are so fuzzy-wuzzy.
No, she says that she wants all humans to die.
Okay.
So Ingrid Newman, I think, is her name.
So anyway, we've got this organization that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that
Are we surprised at all?
That they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at basically their target age group, which is gamer age.
They're trying to get them young, get them in our little bracket, because we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.
PETA makes so much money.
Peta is smart.
They are very smart.
Because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community.
This isn't the first time they've done something like this.
And they know that they will get completely free advertising for a very long time from doing something like this.
I like how they kind of went back on it and said, oh, it's just a joke.
But whatever their weird-ass reasoning was or whatever...
An audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought, the majority of which probably wouldn't give them a second thought, couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.
I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have a show unexpectedly, remember?
So that's when this all kind of came up.
So PETA's very smart at what they're doing, and this is all part of a calculated plan to drive more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer.
It's like you sit there in your inbox and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or you won the lottery or congratulations.
You're really the millionth visitor to this website and you really did win this.
But if one person falls for it, then...
I really hate how an organization can tell us that we are being influenced by games.
I thought that was really important because that is not unique to PETA.
That is absolutely not unique to this organization.
This is just the most recent example of this.
There's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for political office, mind you.
This is far and above any organization.
People that actually wield actual power.
that think gamers are stupid, gamers are easily influenced, gamers care nothing about more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.
You know, like, there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when the reality is, especially now thanks to Facebook, guess what?
We're all gamers.
and I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing as opposed to what they were doing before when PETA made fun of what was it Super Meat Boy was one of the games they did before they did a Cooking Mama one too most people don't know Super Meat Boy most people don't know Cooking Mama
everybody fucking knows Mario and Mario especially Mario 3 what person in their 20s or 30s or hell even most teens that weren't born when this game came out what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3
Thanks for watching!
You know.
I knew plenty of my friends.
Their parents played Mario with them.
And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no.
I know this Mario game.
And you're being stupid.
Yeah.
People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like that that they didn't know.
But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki suit... Like, here's the...
And still goes on in the email to say something like, I used to play Super Mario 3, and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat and wear him like a hat.
But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is, I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch 6 and 7 year olds when they play.
A lot of them are little freaks, and I mean that in a good way.
But a lot of them will pretend to be Tanooki Mario, like, woo, I'm flying, or I'm a Tanooki statue, you know, they'll stay, I mean...
and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb.
But guess what?
When you were six or seven, you were that dumb.
Yeah.
So you didn't want to skin your cat.
You just wanted to be Tanuki Mario.
Mario was your freaking hero.
Sure me, baby.
I'm not going to skin you, but I will use you as socks.
All I have to do is have her sit on my feet.
Anyway.
But anyway, my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that...
I didn't want to skin the cat.
I wanted to be a statue.
I wanted the freaking Hammer Brothers suit.
I wanted to save the princess.
That's because we were 6, 7, whatever age when this game came out.
I wanted to throw hammers at people.
Peeta, you're being dumb.
I wanted to throw hammers at people.
No, seriously.
That was my point.
I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once.
That could still happen.
We could still make that dream come true, DarkSakura.
By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point that I would like to bring up to our listeners of Voting Age.
Sure, and then I want to go to the chat room.
The people with power are trying to make these decisions for us.
Basically, every time that you say, fuck it,
Every time you say, I can't make a difference, or I don't feel like it, every time you display apathy, you're basically saying, do whatever you want to, I don't care.
That means the shit that's going on in the world right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault.
because you didn't vote for the people who need to be the ones to make the change.
You get enough people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.
We'll see change then.
Very serious point and very much needed.
I think everybody better make sure they vote or you can't complain about these things like SOPA and things like that because you elected these people.
My third catchphrase then, because you know my first one is welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.
The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
Number three, change doesn't happen until you make it happen.
I thought it was going to be Reject False Icons, but that works.
No, I stole from Gorillaz.
Alright, fair enough.
Technically, I stole the first one from Space Harrier.
Let me go to some lols from our chatroom, because the chatroom is bringing the lols, and it's talking about Tanuki Mario.
Kaijudo in chat says, I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario.
DDR Dollar Bill says, the only time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned.
Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says, these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.
And also says, PETA never complained about Angry Birds, a game where you slingshot birds into buildings.
Pigs.
All I have to say, wait.
Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote.
Including my husband.
Well, unless you're, you know, 17.
Well, if you're a voting age...
And if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house.
And then you mail it back in.
You know what that requires?
Walk into the mailbox.
All right.
Actdeft says, sadly, I don't live in the U.S.
Well, I meant for people who live here.
People who can vote.
Or in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote.
Your votes matter in your country, in your community.
You make the difference in your own damn community.
Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life.
The end.
All right.
I think DarkSakura is ready for the F use of the week, or maybe she already did it.
Let's get the music anyway.
My FU goes to Bones006 today.
Um... Who, uh... Can't spell.
What has an H in it.
The word is about.
Bout.
B-O-U-T is like a battle.
Or a match.
People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E.
Can't has an apostrophe in it.
And a period.
You are part of what is wrong with the country.
And everybody else, fucking vote.
Alright.
Loki.
Um...
Oh boy.
I guess I'd just say FU2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.
There's only so much time in the day.
my FU of the week just goes to like being like really really busy and just there is so much going on right now and like you know like somebody said to me last night like oh boo hoo you have the biggest problem that you have too much on your social calendar to do but I just it can be exhausting and just you know sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't want to piss people off it's just rough so F you to all that
The holidays are about loving, dammit.
I actually do have a little tiny one, people.
F you to everybody who says that Christmas is becoming less Christian because it wasn't Christian to begin with.
It was very, very, very, very pagan.
The end.
Can't we all just get along?
Oh, come on.
It was about burning trees.
How is that not pagan?
Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?
No, because fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth.
No, but he could make water into wine.
He also wasn't... Never mind.
So I have to say this.
My mom tried to have this argument with me and you were there.
That's where the gay pie party came from.
She says, well, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?
Hanukkah was always Jewish.
um yeah that made no sense mom well also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah no it's actually menorah is a Hebrew word for a candelabra the technical term is a Hanukkiah so it is how about some rapid fire gaming news Loki you have a lot of news to talk to us about we're gonna quickly go through some stories let's talk about Rhythm Heaven it's coming to the Wii in North America and
In February, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and this was announced via Nintendo Power.
So I would say that's pretty legitimate.
I hate the game, to be honest.
I played it on the DS, did not care for Rhythm Heaven.
Just not my thing.
Some people are really into it, though.
I haven't played it enough.
If you like rhythm games, by all means, go ahead and check it out.
Of course, there is supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow you to shoot some 3D video.
Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time.
It is scheduled, though, for this week on December 8th.
So you can look forward to that.
And, of course, that will give you the 3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on.
So more Mario Kart tracks, we can only hope.
Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight.
It is going to be a brand new Microsoft Flight sim.
And, of course, they haven't really unveiled too many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that series.
It's definitely popular, so that'll be cool.
And then, of course, last but not least, or actually, this is even closer to last year,
I kind of thought the theory had something like this, but it's still neat to see anyways.
There's a new device out called the Supa Boy.
And what the Supa Boy does is allows you to play Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo cartridges, on the go.
It's one of those devices that you can play.
It's like a handheld system.
And also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make like a mini console of sorts.
And so that's available for purchase as well.
And actually, I believe it's on Amazon.
Let's see what this thing goes for here.
$80.
That's almost cheaper, I think, than buying Super Nintendo.
But if you want to play something portable without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go.
That's the way to go about it.
Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched Tetris on the iOS, uh, system, or platform, if you will, but there is a little issue with it.
Um, it's $30 a year.
and you can basically... Thanks Apple for opening up the subscription thing to everybody.
Really appreciate that because EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?
It does have some new features including Galaxy Mode and Marathon One Touch Mode, whatever that means.
and also it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay and of course you can subscribe to the Tea Club which offers exclusive access to new mobile challenges and content you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you can drop $30 for a full year and of course the game costs you money anyways it's 99 cents
I'll pass.
Thank you very much.
Ditto.
And then of course, last but not least, Lego Batman 2 is going to be coming out at some point.
And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other superheroes involved with it as well, not just Batman.
In fact, there's a little teaser showing Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as some other characters.
So
and Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes will be the new title, I believe.
That'd be kind of neat.
Also, they're saying that they're expecting that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well.
Looks kind of neat.
It's going to be hard to compete with Arkham City, though, even when you're Legos.
Well, I understand that.
Lego games are pretty fun.
Lego Batman wasn't bad, so it'll be cool.
EverQuest 2 is now going free to play, but here's the weird thing, okay, EverQuest 2
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Bless you.
Oh, rude.
My body faked me out.
Have you ever had that happen?
It's like, I'm going to sneeze, I'm going to sneeze.
Psych.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, hang on.
Great radio.
EverQuest 2 Extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2, and there will be free, there will be silver, and there will be gold.
Free members get just a little bit.
Silver members, which pay $5 or $500 station point things per month, they get a little more.
And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole $15 a month.
Well, shit, you get everything.
So there you go, EverQuest 2.
You can now check out.
I wonder if it'll get the same reception that...
DC Universe did I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff in it EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1 so people didn't want to leave EverQuest 1 which is still going still going DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Well, I have a little something for us.
And that is something about a game that people have been waiting for.
Except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting for.
It's Kid Icarus.
But it's the 3D Classics Kid Icarus.
It's going to be given away for free when...
It launches on January 5th.
You have to register two eligible 3DS titles online this Christmas.
That's kind of janky, but alright, whatever.
It's a Club Nintendo thing.
So you get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes out next year.
But where's the... People...
I totally want a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama
There you go.
All right.
Well, believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight.
So we're going to actually open up the Skype line.
It is open now.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
There's a little bit of a delay tonight.
So before I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be a few more in a minute here.
We'll see.
Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you want to talk about, Loki, with last minute stories before we get to the Twitters?
Yeah, let's talk about how the Vita will not support simultaneous web browsing and gameplay.
You can only do one or the other at the time.
Is that really that big of a deal, though?
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
I mean, I know a lot of people are making a big deal out of it, but I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like, what system now lets you do that?
Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that, hello.
But, you know, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so.
Yeah.
Also, of course, there's that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be discounted 40%.
I don't know where that's... Apparently, it said a recent Vita event is where they announced that.
In my pants.
I...
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Even if they are, that's still too damn much for those.
Yeah, and that's great.
That's promoting that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what?
I wouldn't do that anyways, because guess what?
I get tired of my games after a while, and I want to sell them used.
So, meh.
That's what I think is going to ultimately happen.
I think the hackers are going to find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards.
I could see that happening, absolutely.
Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Anything else?
I like fire.
You do?
there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name I'm so sorry but the guy was writing about how he got hacked and it's like kind of one of those things I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked to finally kind of put it out there where it's like wait a minute I didn't get phished and he even says this in the story like I don't think I got phished you know I'm not happy this is happening to people but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites
So let me go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic.
Remind me to come back to this, okay?
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma Sautome.
Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?
Not much.
A couple of things.
I just got home, so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds cookbook.
No, I didn't.
The Angry Birds cookbook.
Good God, could this game get any more saturated?
It's a cash cow, what can I tell you?
Yeah, right?
Mm-hmm.
So what is in the Angry Birds cookbook?
What will I learn how to cook?
Birds?
Actually, I don't know.
I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to read into it.
What's that?
I'm sorry.
DarkSakura's phone went off.
I said I just saw it online on a friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered.
Maybe it talks about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.
or pig themed recipes.
Seriously?
An Angry Birds cookbook?
Like how?
I don't know.
Forget it.
I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade.
I think that's Loki's department.
Loki's all tiraded out tonight.
I don't know if you heard part A. No, I was at a premiere tonight.
That's all right.
Let's just say that Xenoblade news just kind of one thing led to another on that department.
Oh, God.
I can't wait to listen to tonight's episode.
Oh, and our website's coming back.
That's the big news you missed too.
We'll be back just depending on when DNS updates for people.
So hopefully within 24 hours.
Wonderful.
Yep.
But the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.
A game review?
All right.
What do you want to review?
Voltron, Defender of the Universe for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
What?
You didn't know?
No.
Yes, it came out Wednesday.
I'm in school.
I have no life.
She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft.
But anyway, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.
Long and short of it, you are in control of any of the five lions and it's up to you to protect the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat Lotor.
Is it like a tower defense game?
Actually, no.
The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars.
Oh, that's kind of cool.
I like Geometry Wars.
Now, take your typical treasure shooter.
It's like that.
You're pretty much running around the plains just blasting everything that the lasers can see.
Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up DarkSakura's alley.
It's a cave shooter, or treasure shooter mixed with... Want.
Want.
You should go download the demo on Xbox.
I think I will.
Ukchan, one more thing.
Yes.
If you like it, depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.
Aw, what a nice boy.
Aw, okay.
That's the best part about doing this show.
I'll play it.
Once in a while, free shit.
Heck yeah.
Thank you.
Love you, Ranma.
Love you, mean it.
So on a scale of one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?
Seven.
That's a pretty good review.
So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger?
Hell yeah.
Now what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?
Your butt's for babies.
As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate.
Hey, Ranma, do you know what I actually just watched all of last week?
What?
Go Lion.
I have all of it and I watched all of it.
By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Row is called Hate is Gonna Hate.
I heard about that.
I saw somebody get that on Twitter.
And Ranma.
This is such a great story.
You're gonna hate it, but I don't care.
Okay, so I thought of you this week.
Yeah.
Okay, I was watching Wendy Williams.
That's a man.
I just want you to know.
That's a man.
Okay.
But you know I love Wendy Williams, okay?
How you doing?
And she was talking about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something.
And at the end of it, she said, and I kid you not, she said, stay black.
And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?
Because I thought that joke started here.
Wait, wait, wait.
Rob, stop.
What?
You said you like Wendy Williams?
Haters gonna hate.
50 points from Gryffindor.
All right.
Look, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them.
In this case, somebody saying stay black.
Because that all started with you here on the show, you know.
It didn't actually.
It's not.
Just related to... It's a phrase that's been out for a long time.
Yes, I know that, but I'm just saying.
I heard it in mainstream press this week and it made me think of our Ranma.
Stay black.
Dan didn't bring me any pie.
I'm mad at him.
Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get more calls.
Go back to Voltron.
Have fun.
And of course, stay black.
and you stay fabulous.
I will.
Oh, I will, girl.
All right.
Bye.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Kaijudo in chat says stay black as an old saying.
I know that.
Gosh, I'm just being silly.
All right.
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
How about some tweets in the meantime?
OLRFanForever, hey I like that name, that's a great Twitter name, OLRFanForever, and it's like it's not my mom or something, like it's an actual person OLRFanForever asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester?
Was DarkSakura eliminated?
Actually, I believe DarkSakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention, correct?
I just didn't bother promoting it.
That night it was funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that?
It was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland.
On the negative side, I would be whoring myself out to Sony.
I am no one's whore.
Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo
Absolutely adorable.
Aw, look at her little hoodie on and stuff.
I know, it's precious.
I love it.
Alright, sorry to derail.
Sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Jim Sally train's coming in today.
We gotta have some discussions, people.
First off, we need to talk about Evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers' issues with these game cards expiring.
It's not...
We really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their game cards expire.
It's Evil G's fault.
If I went to the grocery store to buy some milk and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer.
I'd yell at the store that sold me the expired milk.
I think EB Games should be taking these games off their shelves.
It shouldn't be EA's fault.
You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it.
I have to admit, I didn't really think about it like that.
I mean, I don't know.
I kind of...
I get what you're saying.
I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I feel like they didn't really think about this before they implemented this.
I don't think they informed the stores either that they have this problem.
And I kind of think the stores don't know either.
I think people just kind of didn't know.
They told Evil G. You know what Evil G is.
They would just pretend like they didn't know.
Sell it to you anyway.
I don't care.
So they're all in cahoots?
I don't think they're in cahoots.
I think Evil G is just doing it anyway.
EA probably told...
Evil G, yo give us those games back if you don't sell them Evil G's like whatever we can sell anything I would honestly think though that Evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe like an independent ma and pa shop who you know only rarely gets a lot of people that come through there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time and
I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their shelf and I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't control that no one wants the goddamn game I don't know
Well, either way, it ain't EBA's fault.
How long are they supposed to keep these codes active for?
And it's a service.
There's no monetary value to it.
Right.
Because it's a service.
It's not like a gift card.
A gift card is an account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency.
I realize the gift card thing is a stretch.
It is a service being provided later.
It is a little bit like you can't, it's not apples to apples comparison, but my point with that was that it's still, it would be $10 to replace that pass.
So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly you're losing.
You know, it's not a gift card per se.
Yeah.
Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year.
And here's the other thing too.
Look at Blizzard games.
If they're saying that, oh, by the way, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st.
Okay, well then I'm going to buy used.
Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive to do so?
That's not the way to do it.
Really, it's not a way to do it?
We shouldn't punish the publishers for doing this kind of bullshit?
How am I supposed to keep the stuff all open for?
I don't even think it's a punishment thing.
It's just any shopper is going to find the best value they can.
Yeah, man.
It's up to you.
When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up.
to the dealership down the street.
You shop around a little bit before you buy it.
You have to educate yourself a little bit before you buy it.
Yeah, and play the game with people.
Everyone's got a different deal.
But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that.
If there's nothing there, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game and someone hasn't played this copy of the game.
Then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new, I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap.
Now going back to the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore?
Because they know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day.
EA has already made their money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf.
They don't care at this point if the game is sold new or used because they already sold the game.
They're probably not buying new copies of that game anyway, so they probably have a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyway.
And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, say I want to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that.
Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies that are used that are in good quality that you can get for $5, $10 cheaper or whatever.
And most people are like, okay, sure, I'll do that.
Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that.
But
You can probably guess that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run of Mass Effect 2.
Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, well not a Game of the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.
That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.
I mean, I don't know.
I haven't really looked at it, but they may have.
All right.
Well, Jim, Sally, I've got to wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets.
Do you have any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter?
South Park Games is going to be a great game.
Obsidian is doing it.
They're the best developers ever in the world.
Obsidian, thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 New Vegas.
Knights of the Republic 2 I love you everybody and don't forget if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed you're picking it too much or not enough thank you for that sage advice Jim Sally appreciate it
I have high hopes for the South Park game too, I will say.
So I hope they don't let me down.
Back to the Twitters.
1877GameOLR, username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
We can probably squeeze in like one more call.
DarkTetsuyo tweeted us and said, Hey, OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One.
I don't think I've ever loved a book this much.
P.S.
Fuck the Sixers.
I'm assuming that's something from the book?
Yes, it is.
saying the Day One Studios who developed Fear 3 and Mecha Salt, they laid off 95%.
That's an entire development team because they lost a publishing deal with Konami.
Apparently, they were working on a reboot of Silent Scope.
Interesting.
But I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they pulled it.
I guess.
Yeah, Silent Scope's kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go...
Maybe with all the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off.
Maybe.
Well, they didn't have to do it that way.
I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now.
They have Sniper Elite, and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior or something like that.
That was...
um actually pretty well liked and they have sequels coming out I mean there's not a lot of sniper games but I think something like Silent Scope would have stood out I would have guessed that they were working on was it that I remember the fuck the series is called now the one that was on the PSP and then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3 it was like a sci-fi shooter or something like that I don't even remember that's how wonderful that game was um but there was it was supposed to be like a launch title for the PS3 but I guess that would have been a little late
Alright, let me go to the phones.
We've got one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Kokomo.
I just have a question.
When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3?
That's a lot of Mass Effect.
I've got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me, but here's the thing.
What I really like about what they're doing with Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea.
I mean, I guess this is from that
Demo that leaked out before and all that remember how they had the demo up early is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode that focuses more on the battle it's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end of the game you like more and the RPG mode to me sounds really really interesting because I do think Bioware can tell some good stories so but as far as like do I have enough time to freaking play Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably not
but if Mass Effect 2 or if they do with 3 what they do with 2 didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect 1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game sort of yeah on the PS3 they did so maybe there'll be something like that so at least the rest of us can get caught up what's your opinion on it are you a Mass Effect fan
I really do enjoy Mass Effect.
I'm probably going to have to take a whole week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3.
Then you have all the different things.
You can be evil, and that's another play around.
It's just so much time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
based on how he was playing the story.
And this is one thing that Bioware is really good at, and it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about the Old Republic, because love or hate Star Wars, they're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect-style storytelling in Dragon Age into an MMO, and for some people, that's very, very exciting.
Absolutely.
All right, that's all my questions.
You guys have a great night.
That's it, all right.
Thanks for your station.
I won't, bye
TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here, and that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to Astoria1up.com.
where apparently the Digital Millennium Copyright Act the DMCA a few exemptions were granted about a year ago which had to do with the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use now the EFF is saying shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well if you want to mod your video game consoles what do you think I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if you can jailbreak your phone why can't you jailbreak your video game console
I was going to say, is it really illegal to do that right now?
Uh, technically, I mean, sort of it is.
I mean, but they're just not going to come after the user.
Especially now that, you know, they have, in fact, ironically enough, I'm looking at something right now about reset glitch hacking on, well, you can do it on any Xbox 360 regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now.
And looking at, you know, slim modding and stuff like that.
Just curious to see what's required for that stuff.
Interesting.
I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem.
It's that they don't want you playing pirated games on it for one and using exploits and all that stuff as well.
So that's why usually these companies will kick you off the network, which they can do because it's their network.
Exactly.
But for instance, didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation 3s because they were supercomputers?
Uh-huh.
They probably...
Never upgraded them, or who knows?
Maybe they even found a workaround so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.
Is that illegal?
I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation Network.
They're just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight, and that's also going to do it for the Skype line.
Big apologies to those who didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+.
We'll take your comments there, too, and we can read some of those on the show.
But for now, that's it.
We're wrapping up.
We're getting out of here.
You were done with last-minute stories, right, Loki?
Yeah.
Okay.
I didn't have anything.
I figured, because you would have spoke up if you did.
Hey!
So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio.
It's almost 9 o'clock or midnight on the East Coast, so I think it's about time to wrap up.
First off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show.
Thank you for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
It's been kind of a poopy past couple weeks with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us.
and those of you that are listening live or still showing up and listening live.
We have a lot of people in chat tonight.
So thank you guys so much.
And podcasties, you've stuck by us and here you are downloading another show.
So I really appreciate it.
Thanks for the support.
Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money.
Although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.
Yes.
That will be an exception.
uh but you know here on this program we don't ask for your money all we ask help spread the word tell somebody about the program and uh you know help the OL Army grow so on that note let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can get out of here tonight Loki I'll start with you your final thought tonight
My final thought is I'm picking a really weird song for Cage Match.
Awesome.
My final thought is now that Loki's Lamey Borrows Saints Row the Third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the character that Travis Donovan made?
Online pass is only for playing co-op or system link.
All right.
I'm going to have to figure out how to do that.
I want Travis Donovan's little character of me.
You need to create a profile on the Saints Row website.
Once you do that, you go browse to his character and you add it as a bookmark or something like that and you go into your game and you log in with your account from the Saints Row website and then you can download it.
I can do that.
Yes.
Awesome.
Alright, and DarkSakura, your final thought.
Thanks for watching!
All right.
Well, thank you guys again for tuning in and downloading the show.
And one more time, awesome event happening this Thursday, December 8th, 630 Pacific, 930 Eastern, umlaut.org.
I'll be there live.
DarkSakura will be there in-house.
If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you better be at the DNA Lounge.
Bring 10 bucks.
Bring a little more.
to donate for some raffle tickets and stuff to a great cause, Umlaut.
We're going to rock out.
So I'll see you on Thursday, and then we'll see you again back here Sunday night for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Until then, have a wonderful week.
