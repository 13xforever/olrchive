11
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:37,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine Yeah, alright, good Actually, I don't know about you guys, I am doing very, very well I got great news, literally, two minutes, literally, two minutes before we went live tonight Like, after the call with Bobby on his show, before our show went live

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Our website is coming back.

13
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:42,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

14
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

15
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:44,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

16
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:49,930
[SPEAKER_08]: For those who have not been following the drama, OrangeLawnsRadio.com has been down due to some stuff and things.

17
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,650
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll leave it at that.

18
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And out of our control.

19
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes.

20
00:01:54,894 --> 00:02:00,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Namely, and I want to give a shout out to Jason and Deekman behind the scenes have ensured that it will be back up.

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's the thing.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I could flip the switch right now and some people would see it.

23
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:07,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out.

24
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:10,865
[SPEAKER_08]: The way DNS works, it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours.

25
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:12,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

26
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:22,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So that also keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.

27
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

28
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but anyhow, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.

29
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:32,693
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site so everybody will get the show and we'll have a website again.

30
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

31
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:34,014
[SPEAKER_11]: You better watch out though.

32
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:38,935
[SPEAKER_11]: If they catch you pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison for no reason.

33
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we talking about this?

34
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to be happy about the show.

35
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:44,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy.

36
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:45,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming back for the show.

37
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

38
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Party.

39
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:48,862
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow.

40
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,303
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

41
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:54,346
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time the podcast-y people download this and hear it, it's probably back up and running.

42
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Live listeners, you're finding out about two minutes after I did.

43
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I said you all would be the first to know.

44
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

45
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,054
[SPEAKER_08]: So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, because right now I'm trying to do a show.

46
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you showing me up your sleeve?

47
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:07,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at my fake watch.

48
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,978
[SPEAKER_08]: even though we are not televised I'm still going through motions and looking at my fake watch

49
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:17,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what else was I going to say?

50
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:18,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn you, woman.

51
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:18,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You threw me off.

52
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

53
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:23,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It does work.

54
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up right now, even on the backup site for the folks listening live.

55
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:39,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We do encourage you to join our chat room at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want, such as Jim Sally in our chat room says, 24-hour pirate special at OLR.com.

58
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:56,937
[SPEAKER_08]: You have that look on your face like I have something smart ass I'm gonna say Yes, but it doesn't fit into the conversation that we're having right now Does it ever fit into the conversation we're having right now?

59
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unfortunately a week too late A week too late?

60
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is a week too late Alright, now I have to know, what's your week old joke?

61

[SPEAKER_07]: Say it Well, the Xbox Luba has a slick interface

62
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:11,836
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's still funny.

63
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox lube jokes are still funny.

64
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:20,110
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website.

65
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,631
[SPEAKER_08]: But there will be.

66
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:22,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

67
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:23,995
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, look.

68
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about other exciting things.

69
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:31,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only is our website coming back up, but there's an awesome charity event.

70
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: We've pimped this on the show for years.

71
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:38,628
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday, in San Francisco.

72
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:42,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you need to go to this event because I'm going to be there.

73
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:43,953
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's going to be there.

74
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:45,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you're not going to be there.

75
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:50,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part of it.

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim.

77
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,058
[SPEAKER_11]: The moment I said that, Shermie looked up at me like, the hell you will.

78
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:05,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing, DarkSakura and I are going to San Francisco, and Salacious doesn't call, we don't call Salacious Pop anymore, but Alan is going to.

79
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:16,371
[SPEAKER_07]: To be very honest, you know, had I not been locked into the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have bid and won that, uh, the be on the stage thing, you know.

80
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I know, do the rock band.

81
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I like winning eBay auctions, so you know.

82
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:21,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me back up.

83
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,155
[SPEAKER_08]: For those that don't know what Loom Loud is, because I know we've talked about this for years on the show.

84
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:30,137
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like... Some people in chat were mentioning earlier, I've been listening for five years.

85
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been listening since this was single digits on the show.

86
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,059
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been pimping this for a long time.

87
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:35,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great charity event.

88
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA Lounge, which is an actual venue.

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of famous stuff that happens at DNA Lounge.

90
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Club Booty is one of the biggest examples of that.

91
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:47,863
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the mashup club night where they actually mash songs together.

92
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:48,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of those...

93
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,644
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

94
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:45,521
[SPEAKER_08]: and that money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event which is really worth it alone but you get to pick a prize off the swag table and I'm not allowed to say what I know about the swag table this year but there's like really good stuff that people are going to walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event and they're going to be doing a raffle they're going to be doing these silent auctions I don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction I don't know what I can and can't say so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty but I will say

95
00:06:46,061 --> 00:07:14,484
[SPEAKER_08]: but I will say this the silent auction stuff is amazing too like one of the items in particular oh my god oh my god anybody that like grew up on an NES is gonna lose their shit over this it's amazing so and I can't remember if that's one of the eBay ones or not because yes you're gonna be able to participate online as well and you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and and and this is so cool you're gonna get to watch it online it's all streaming at umloud.org and why am I pimping this so bad?

96
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:45,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be pimping it anyway but I'm especially pimping it because there's a live pre-show for the first time ever that's going to be happening video from it and they asked me to co-host so I'm going to be doing it with some other friends in the gaming community including Carnage who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff which will be very cool some other folks from other websites are involved too so it's no like singular website doing it this is not an OLR show it's just we're helping we're one of the cooks in the kitchen with this

97
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,941
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's going to be great.

98
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Met a lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place and yeah, it's going to be a kick-ass show.

99
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So make plans to be here.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be delivered to your house.

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

104
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:31,071
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to lend our full support and if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what?

105
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a drink together.

106
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:33,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say at least that much.

107
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:33,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

108
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:34,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not really going to make out with you.

109
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:35,432
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

110
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:36,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

111
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And DarkSakura will not show you her boobs.

112
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:38,374
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

113
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:42,275
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am the designer this year.

114
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:51,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not say much more than that but you get to see my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall.

115
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:51,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

116
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,541
[SPEAKER_11]: and other things.

117
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:54,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

118
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:55,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah.

119
00:08:56,305 --> 00:09:01,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little creepy because I don't do video.

120
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:01,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've done...

121
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:27,278
[SPEAKER_08]: you can see my work on that too I've done audio stuff since 97 so this is one of the first I mean besides back when we were doing the Justin TV like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show which I don't think makes for exciting video but some people miss it maybe it'll come back someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it but yeah I'm excited I'm into it I'm happy

122
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,902
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted to borrow, not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months.

124
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,557
[SPEAKER_11]: You completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister.

125
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,559
[SPEAKER_08]: From the dollar store, yes.

126
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Rob a penguin snow globe at the dollar store.

127
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,303
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the thought that counts.

128
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:15,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I waited in line twice as long as I spent shopping.

129
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate the dollar store this time of year.

130
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:32,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler At least he's a little balder than me But cuter Which isn't saying much

131
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

132
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:36,541
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

133
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, it's not about that.

134
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about getting you guys to show up.

135
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,207
[SPEAKER_08]: They know.

136
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:44,047
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the thing.

137
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:47,530
[SPEAKER_08]: They know that the OLR and that the All Games people are rabid people.

138
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we will do this stuff, they're more likely to show up.

139
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys have to represent.

140
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just OLR, but all games.

141
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:58,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And show up and cheer loudly and be excited about Umlaut.

142
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of all, please donate.

143
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a tough time of year, but keep in mind the charity.

144
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,284
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher.

145
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:10,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity.

146
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:14,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, umlaut.org on Thursday.

147
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,871
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

148
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:17,772
[SPEAKER_08]: How about video games?

149
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into how our gaming weeks were and all that good stuff.

150
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,617
[SPEAKER_08]: We always like to kick off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?

151
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:24,138
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

152
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I played stuff that wasn't well.

153
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,301
[SPEAKER_11]: That made me play well, too.

154
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Last night started the family tradition.

155
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,687
[SPEAKER_11]: We broke out the Saturn and played Christmas nights.

156
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it must be the holidays.

157
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we realized that our battery wasn't working, so we couldn't save anything.

158
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan decided that he was going to play Rayearth anyway, so he started playing Rayearth.

159
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:48,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally played my copy of P.O.P.O.

160
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,271
[SPEAKER_11]: 2 on the Sega Saturn, and you know what?

161
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:51,233
[SPEAKER_11]: That game sucks.

162
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that it sucks that it's a bad game, because P.O.P.O.

163
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:54,917
[SPEAKER_11]: is awesome.

164
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,799
[SPEAKER_11]: It kicked my ass.

165
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I am that out of practice on P.O.P.O.

166
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:27,950
[SPEAKER_11]: and we played through Parodius Da we played through GKL Parodius sorry, Gokujil Parodius we played through a little bit of Oshaberry Parodius a lot of Parodius Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn and then he beat Thunder Force 3

167
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:30,515
[SPEAKER_11]: On Saturn.

168
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, just sat down and played.

169
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:35,859
[SPEAKER_11]: There's apparently something called Kids Mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields.

170
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,381
[SPEAKER_11]: So he was just doing Stress Relief Mode, pretty much.

171
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:53,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I played, actually, some of the Blue Seed RPG, until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG, because I read like a retarded five-year-old in Japanese.

172
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,453
[SPEAKER_08]: You had quite the Sega-filled retro week, didn't you?

173
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:56,993
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more.

174
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:57,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my.

175
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I found my Utena game.

176
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:00,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play it.

177
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that the Dish game?

178
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:05,098
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura.

179
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I can never remember these things.

180
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,061
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was Clamp involved because I played Rayearth.

181
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:14,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was going to play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or anything.

182
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:20,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I bought Dan's present.

183
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell him anybody.

184
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It's... That's what Dan got.

185
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:28,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to repeat that.

186
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:33,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to tell anybody why I got Dan because they'll tell him because of freaking internet.

187
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,542
[SPEAKER_11]: People can't keep a secret.

188
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,223
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

189
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I bathed the cat.

190
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a game all in itself.

191
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:49,926
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just... See what offended faces Shermie can make at you.

192
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,467
[SPEAKER_11]: She's asleep in her bed now, but she doesn't... She does look cleaner.

193
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:53,768
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a lot cleaner.

194
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,609
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't smell like her ass anymore.

195
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,170
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good thing when she's right underneath me.

196
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,651
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't smell like old lady anymore.

197
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:00,392
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

198
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:04,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like cat old lady.

199
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments from chat.orangelontrady.com.

200
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:11,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in our chat room says, It's officially the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights.

201
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:12,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

202
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:12,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Do-do.

203
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:14,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

204
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:16,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty says, woo, kid mode.

205
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:17,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good for me.

206
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:18,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

207
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Preach it.

208
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:31,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate last night, that Dan was, the little night song was playing, and I remembered the whole thing.

209
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I was singing along with it.

210
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,662
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing I remembered the whole thing of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese.

211
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:39,503
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why that is?

212
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:40,023
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

213
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:40,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're a nerd.

214
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:42,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this song.

215
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,164
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cute song.

216
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:43,904
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

217
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:45,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

218
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play any old-school Sega?

219
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:52,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, broke out the Sega Saturn to play Hanukkah Nights.

220
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not quite as popular as Christmas Nights.

221
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:56,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's eight stages.

222
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight stages, and it's a little longer.

223
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was pretty good.

224
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:16,568
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually I played lots of Skyrim and ran across my fair share of glitches, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity on Facebook.

225
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:27,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I fought a dragon, and all of a sudden it froze for a second, and then this giant dirt thing was in front of me.

226
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:34,461
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to post it to the Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing down here.

227
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to give you an idea of how tall this thing is, it's just ridiculous.

228
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like an old faithful made out of dirt.

229
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

230
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is completely non-solid.

231
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:45,622
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just run right through it.

232
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, big mountain that it created.

233
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's weird.

234
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:59,532
[SPEAKER_07]: That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, today I was playing, all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like...

235
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, this is that same dragon I just killed, like, hours ago, days ago.

236
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It just fell from the sky again.

237
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:09,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so glitchy.

238
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:15,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple weeks just because of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but I really need to play it more.

239
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:16,779
[SPEAKER_08]: God.

240
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:17,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking chat.

241
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:18,519
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

242
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: What did chat do now?

243
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,421
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making assumptions, so I just said it.

244
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:22,942
[SPEAKER_08]: You're dirty.

245
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I mean, I haven't really been doing anything.

246
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:34,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had to force myself to go to the next actual quest or the storyline quest.

247
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,871
[SPEAKER_07]: But along the way, of course, I had to waste a bunch of time and went back to Helgen and...

248
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:43,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.

249
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a dragon flying backwards today.

250
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:46,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

251
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:09,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, 360.

252
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:11,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing on PS3.

253
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:12,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't notice any bugs, really.

254
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:19,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing still on the last patch, the 1.1, because I'm not dumb enough to download 1.2.

255
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, nope, I'm not going to download that.

256
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:28,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I like having magical resistance and stuff like that, and my dragons flying forward.

257
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:50,601
[SPEAKER_07]: so I've been playing that and then actually I'm setting up my JTAG to play once I'm done how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can port over the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a JTAG

258
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is fantastic.

259
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you can do a bunch of cool things with that.

260
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I'm not doing that right now.

261
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually just playing legitimately.

262
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:20,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their belongings, which is never a good idea because I started selling some firewood back to one of the inns or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place.

263
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: of everything that was not steel.

264
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now people eating, I'm taking your food.

265
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Just all sorts of fun stuff like that.

266
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:29,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

267
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you helped them out.

268
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,272
[SPEAKER_07]: What's theirs is yours.

269
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

270
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:36,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I sold it back to them, which is great.

271
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,791
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do some mean things in Skyrim.

272
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,352
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some really funny stuff.

273
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to this one fort, and all these bandits were running around.

274
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:49,658
[SPEAKER_07]: There was this old woman, and she's like, I come with the fort.

275
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,079
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people coming and going.

276
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who's taking over.

277
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,642
[SPEAKER_07]: One side wins, the other side comes back.

278
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:59,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So meanwhile, all these bandits are attacking it, and I'm attacking them.

279
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, I think you should leave.

280
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:04,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's following me around saying, I think you should leave.

281
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:06,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hilarious.

282
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm going to kill you, bitch.

283
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep fucking talking to me.

284
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:15,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she finally, she's still there, but now the Imperial forces are there.

285
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:22,150
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's hilarious, because she's like, these people that have captured her, she's just like, I think you should go.

286
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, well, no, I'm not going to.

287
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:55,904
[SPEAKER_08]: you know the thing Skyrim obviously is doing amazingly well you know and it's a single player game and everything and I notice a lot of what makes single player games really transcend into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like Grand Theft Auto 4 or Grand Theft Auto 3 which while granted they do have their multiplayer modes they're probably more known for their single player I think these games that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable yeah stuff that the people create in the environments and

288
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,246
[SPEAKER_08]: The Turd Has Its Own Microcosm

289
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really do.

290
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:16,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably going to go back to Saints Row again because I was looking at it and I'm like, I don't have all the achievements yet.

291
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost there, but I really hated doing the car theft missions and so I didn't.

292
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:29,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I also had to replay the game as a female character for at least two hours and get that achievement.

293
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had to finish some of the other story missions in a different way than I did before.

294
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's almost at the end.

295
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I played this week also was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1, you know, Call of Duty 4.

296
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're playing just regular free-for-all deathmatches.

297
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:55,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going old-school free-for-all deathmatches, which is kind of a little bit like Grand Theft Auto deathmatches where you start off with the same weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along.

298
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of fun just mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game eventually.

299
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,852
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is, so it's like every time I'm like, okay, I gotta work on the mod game.

300
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:07,043
[SPEAKER_07]: or I can play Skyrim and usually Skyrim wins out, you know.

301
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:08,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know how it goes.

302
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:13,826
[SPEAKER_07]: That game, literally, it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it.

303
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I collect shit.

304
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:16,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I hoard it all.

305
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,188
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your wife's opinion?

306
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Your wife pretty much hates video games.

307
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:20,629
[SPEAKER_07]: She's reading books.

308
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:21,269
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't care.

309
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I heard out of her like yesterday was, oh, that's pretty.

310
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:27,952
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because, you know, it's the environment and stuff.

311
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:28,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty.

312
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:32,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, you know, I attacked a mammoth the other day and stuff.

313
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I killed a couple bears today.

314
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:35,397
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pissing me off.

315
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:36,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

316
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:37,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you find the cave of bears?

317
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did find the cave of bears.

318
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

319
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it was... It's right outside one of the quest towns.

320
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:46,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called, like, Bear Cave or something like that.

321
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:46,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

322
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,867
[SPEAKER_08]: You go in and it's nothing but bears.

323
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,289
[SPEAKER_07]: There was two bears in a cave that I found.

324
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was that.

325
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on my way to... I don't remember the damn town names.

326
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember it's been a while.

327
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:56,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

328
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:56,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

329
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anything else for your week you want to share?

330
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:00,156
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

331
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:00,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

332
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,998
[SPEAKER_08]: My game of the week, actually not quite as exciting as my co-host this week.

333
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:05,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week.

334
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to get Mario Kart 7 today, but I neglected to order online, and now that I'm trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it until after Christmas.

335
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:15,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, screw you!

336
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:21,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to know, I was literally next door to an evil G today and I still didn't want to go in.

337
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I'll wait till I go to Target later in the week.

338
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:28,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, no Mario Kart 7 for me today, but I will get it this week.

339
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:30,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Just things are a little bit crazy right now.

340
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:34,869
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier, prepping for Thursday and just everything else going on with my day job.

341
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:36,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Darkmoon Faire Darkmoon Faire

342
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:58,535
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

343
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:14,084
[SPEAKER_08]: www.hoardhouse.com

344
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:42,738
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to forgive me, I forgot the name Somebody in chat I'm sure will yell it out But it's the bundle that had Cthulhu, Saves the World It's like a big something bundle I don't know Yeah, and then it had a really Big world bundle maybe?

345
00:23:42,758 --> 00:24:00,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it had a really neat sounding game in it Which between that and the Xbox Live Indie games that I'd played before I knew it would be worth it It was like poker mixed with puzzle game mixed with RPG It sounded really cool So I wanted to play that I just didn't get around to it this week

346
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,795
[SPEAKER_08]: because, again, new WoW patch, busy day life.

347
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be awesome if it was Swords and Poker for the PC.

348
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:08,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not Swords and Poker PC.

349
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:09,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something else.

350
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:11,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That was another game that took over my life.

351
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:15,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't even get the answer for them.

352
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

353
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:19,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll come up in a little while, I'm sure.

354
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:29,749
[SPEAKER_07]: See, the problem with those indie bundles is I'm not buying any more until I play the one that I have, and I've only played one game out of it, VVVV.

355
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I still haven't played all the other ones out of that Humble Indie Bundle.

356
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:39,438
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, it'll probably be a while before I buy any more of those.

357
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:45,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I was looking a little bit on Xbox Indie Games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet.

358
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought about buying some stuff.

359
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:48,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost bought DLC Quest.

360
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I was like, how often would I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff?

361
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be something that I...

362
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:23,242
[SPEAKER_08]: purchase later on all right thank you guys thank you chat room chat.orangelandradio.com it was Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle it's done that was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it I don't know but it's done so unfortunately you can't buy this now but let's see unless maybe you can now the current minimum is done it says or beat the minimum I don't know what the minimum is

363
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:52,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you can still buy it but you look down here and it says one minute five seconds ago they were still selling it so I don't think you can let me try four dollars go see if it'll work but anyway it had Breath of Death Cthulhu Saves the World the game I was trying to think of Rune Spell Overture that's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out so there you go and sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore I think it's done so can't get it now

364
00:25:55,242 --> 00:26:03,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, chat.orange.com if you want to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.

365
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:05,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

366
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other things we want to plug.

367
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Lol, you're old.

368
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:09,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

369
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about this earlier and they were like, no, you're not old.

370
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:13,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, no, I'm forgetting things left and right.

371
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,271
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple other things we wanted to mention before we get into tonight's news.

372
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet.

373
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:26,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

374
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:33,079
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also send in your questions for tonight because we'll get into Twitter topics a little later in the show when we get into Part B. Our Facebook is there as well.

375

00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,942
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank God there will be a mailbag again next week, hopefully as well, if we're getting the old website back.

383
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be up midweek or so.

384
00:26:59,043 --> 00:26:59,304
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

385
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some gaming news.

386
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight.

387
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:09,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so lots of stuff coming out about the PlayStation Vita.

388
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:16,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, one of the things that people are wondering is, how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us?

389
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's going to be something reasonable, right?

390
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:19,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

391
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:20,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

392
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:21,104
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

393
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:24,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

394
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty high priced.

395
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:31,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Or as you might say, not reasonable.

396
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, not reasonable at all.

397
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:53,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they're saying that according to GameStop, or the Evil G if you will, they have it listed on their website that the 4GB card is going to be $29.99, although they have, I guess, Sony has told some websites that the 4GB cards actually retail for $24.99, 8GB cards for $39.99.

398
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:06,713
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but, I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it listed for.

399
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:17,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So beyond the 4 and 8 gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will run you $69.99, and 32 will be $119.99.

400
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:22,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is this important?

401
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're required.

402
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:28,179
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to have a memory card to play your games, for the most part.

403
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:35,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Most games require the memory card, and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory card in order to do that.

404
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:38,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's proprietary, so you can't just, you know...

405
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:43,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Get an SD card or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper.

406
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:48,594
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right?

407
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what their fear is, or they're going to hack the system somehow.

408
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you this much, Sony.

409
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:58,962
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have.

410
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:00,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to happen.

411
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to have a memory card.

412
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And is Sony selling a bundle that includes a memory card?

413
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:12,309
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have launch bundles or whatever that come with like a two gigabyte one, I think.

414
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, oh my God, I can't believe they're releasing the Vita for $250.

415
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:27,897
[SPEAKER_08]: That is in fact a lie because $250 doesn't get you a memory card.

416
00:29:28,137 --> 00:29:28,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

417
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:30,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah.

418
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,400
[SPEAKER_07]: But some games do not require it.

419
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:33,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

420
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves, and they also have storage for download content and stuff like that.

421
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:45,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other games require memory cards for that storage as well.

422
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, if these stupid things are required, then the system's not really $250, is it?

423
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:57,738
[SPEAKER_08]: But because there is that little, you know, we call that a loophole, where it's like, okay, well, really, you can play some games without one, right?

424
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:01,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360, remember when they first released it?

425
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,761
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to get a hard drive, but, you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever.

426
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:10,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're a little ridiculous, and I mean, I understand the price of memory.

427
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:14,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards.

428
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when everything else is way cheaper.

429
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:22,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive prices.

430
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:23,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120?

431
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

432
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you can get a 250GB hard drive for probably about $30 if not cheaper than that and it's just such a high markup and it's not anything really special either it's just a laptop hard drive formatted a special way which you can get any laptop drive and format it that special way if you have the right software to do that

433
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:50,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, some of our folks in the chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing.

434
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:55,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And so like SSJ100Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now upwards from $350.

435
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:58,639
[SPEAKER_08]: And Avakan Anagram is like, no, it's $250 plus $25.

436
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is nice.

437
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:06,765
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video player.

438
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:12,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD Passport thing?

439
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get this right.

440
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:29,753
[SPEAKER_08]: If I want to play Luminous old school all over again, assuming it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is, I need to buy the right to get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some of these games on.

441
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:30,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

442
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:34,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game would just cost me used anyway.

443
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:37,696
[SPEAKER_08]: to just play on my old PSP.

444
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:38,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

445
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:41,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Logic doesn't apply when it comes to new video games, Rob.

446
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

447
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... It's so interesting to me because what got everybody excited about the Vita?

448
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:52,548
[SPEAKER_08]: What truly got everybody like, fuck yeah, Sony Vita!

449
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:54,510
[SPEAKER_08]: What got everybody really excited about it?

450
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,270
[SPEAKER_08]: The price.

451
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:56,111
[SPEAKER_08]: The back touch.

452
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:56,972
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that price.

453
00:31:57,052 --> 00:31:58,093
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was not the back touch.

454
00:31:58,113 --> 00:31:59,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not the reach around.

455
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that $250 price.

456
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:03,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's kind of like, oh, but it's...

457
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know.

458
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:15,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how we were talking last week about Ridge Racer?

459
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another thing to lose a little excitement about the Vita over.

460
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little bit cheaper than your average PlayStation game.

461
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:32,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $29.99, whereas your average going cost for a Vita game is going to be $39.99.

462
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:41,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the game.

463
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

464
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:44,886
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

465
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:45,747
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

466
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:46,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to save myself $30.

467
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just not going to buy that game.

468
00:32:50,194 --> 00:33:17,448
[SPEAKER_08]: you know I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am a consumer whore and I want all the new toys but I'm finding myself a little less excited than I was a few months ago I mean at the end of the day it's all about games it is all about the game and if there is a truly like kick ass oh my god blow my mind game on this thing like you know I gotta say Luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic if there's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita then you know

469
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,003
[SPEAKER_08]: All this stuff seems a little less.

470
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:20,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's worth waiting.

471
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:26,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that.

472
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:30,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything.

473
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:34,021
[SPEAKER_07]: It nets you a bunch of problems and a more expensive price point.

474
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:35,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That is it.

475
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:36,264
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to net?

476
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I get to play some of these games early.

477
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:41,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's all Generation 1 stuff.

478
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is there really anything super fantastic?

479
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:48,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then Uncharted game might be worth it to you.

480
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan, but I'm not buying Ridge Racer.

481
00:33:53,346 --> 00:34:01,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care about a new LittleBigPlanet game or ports of a bunch of older games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or UFC game, MMA stuff.

482
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:11,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care that they're porting that stuff over right now.

483
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chat room is on fire.

484
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:16,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It is literally burning with conversation on this whole thing.

485
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:18,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Alfcananagram's talking about the bundle.

486
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation Vita first edition bundle.

487
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:27,063
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, 4 gigabyte card, and little deviants, $349.

488
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,464
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I sound like a PR dude.

489
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta admit, not all that stuff interests me.

490
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:35,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably gonna want a card more than 4 gigabits and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3G.

491
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't need it.

492
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they have one that's without the 3G as well but I'm not sure if that's available over here.

493
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's only in Canada.

494
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.

495
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, one more comment I'm going to get to here from a private message.

496
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:14,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I don't read private messages because I'm like, talk in the main room.

497
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,001
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll let Miklatov have this one because he did guest on Horde House earlier today, so he did me a favor.

498
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,582
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, even though he only did a mediocre job.

499
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,543
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just kidding, just kidding.

500
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to give him to alt tab and say something angry.

501
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:35,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Miklatov says, Rumor has it that the memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus retail box.

502
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but here's the thing about that.

503
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:41,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all rumor, and I don't know if that's actually true or not.

504
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:49,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, all that is is just incentivizing you to buy the more expensive memory card because...

505
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:54,546
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, say you buy a 4GB stick, what's that going to hold?

506
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,287
[SPEAKER_07]: One or two games?

507
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not going to offset the price of that memory card.

508
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:13,384
[SPEAKER_08]: All I have to say is the more and more we talk about all this, and please let that 40% thing be true, because once that news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react?

509
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:23,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised.

510
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:27,000
[SPEAKER_07]: The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy, GameStop included.

512
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:31,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

513
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:34,683
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is it until the Vita comes out in Japan?

514
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:36,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, isn't that like right around the corner?

515
00:36:38,016 --> 00:37:04,951
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it's like the 17th I thought the price points that they had for games on I don't know if that's just been announced yet but I don't think it's going to be 40% I think it's going to be either the same price or just slightly under not 40% if it is 40% cool then that way maybe it gets more people to buy their games or whatever or people just be more selective in what they buy

516
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:08,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with another story.

517
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:09,846
[SPEAKER_08]: This is also about Sony.

518
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:15,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what to think of this news, and I think a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either.

519
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:21,110
[SPEAKER_08]: There are rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony.

520
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:21,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Ueda.

521
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Ueda, excuse me.

522
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:24,691
[SPEAKER_08]: He's quit Sony, and why is this important?

523
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:29,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's the creative lead behind Team Ico, which is creating The Last Guardian.

524
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:31,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember The Last Guardian?

525
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that?

526
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:38,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That was that game that showed up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good.

527
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:40,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was suddenly absent this year.

528
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, apparently he is left.

529
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:46,439
[SPEAKER_07]: The game hasn't come out yet.

530
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that explains why it was supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not.

531
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:56,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly he is working on the project still.

532
00:37:56,463 --> 00:37:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: He's freelancing.

533
00:37:58,164 --> 00:38:25,852
[SPEAKER_08]: but uh yeah interesting Sony was asked to comment on the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation right okay be interesting to see how that impacts that game especially if they announce it now for the 360 and the Wii U maybe that's the surprise it's on the Wii U Wii U what about the Wii U Loki

534
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:28,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

535
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't do anything yet.

536
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:50,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a video with some tech demos and shit.

537
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:57,822
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that doesn't, but at E3, that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware.

538
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:11,009
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm saying is that if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you Shadow of the Colossus and Ico, comes the last Guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just be like, I don't give a fuck.

539
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,530
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you're going to hear in the audience.

540
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:23,407
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not gonna... It's not gonna go to any other platform other than Sony.

541
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee it.

542
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,088
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not gonna happen.

543
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,929
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit.

544
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not fun to fantasize about.

545
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:33,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

546
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

547
00:39:34,963 --> 00:39:35,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Retail Exclusive

548
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just the game stuff.

549
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:19,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but... They said Nintendo of America has said that it's going to be out in April 2012.

550
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:27,994
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, why... Why not have just already put it out?

551
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:29,436
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in English.

552
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:31,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It's there.

553
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:31,558
[SPEAKER_11]: It's there.

554
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:33,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Why wait?

555
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:39,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, DarkSakura, they have to remove the U's and put the Z's back in.

556
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:40,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

557
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:43,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

558
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:46,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, the Z's.

559
00:40:47,676 --> 00:40:49,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the Z's are now Z's.

560
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:55,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look nonsensical.

561
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Americans won't understand it.

562
00:40:57,804 --> 00:40:59,145
[SPEAKER_11]: So yogurt has an H in it.

563
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there yogurt in the Xenoblade Chronicles?

564
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:05,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.

565
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,829
[SPEAKER_08]: There probably is yogurt.

566
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Just... You know what?

567
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:16,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for that, I'm still gonna get the British one.

568
00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:16,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Look.

569
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this.

570
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,329
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I haven't pre-ordered it.

571
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I have until April.

572
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Why pre-order it today?

573
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:29,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to pre-order this.

574
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:37,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I do because I really feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to fail?

575
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever heard that before?

576
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,651
[SPEAKER_08]: You're setting me up to fail.

577
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:43,392
[SPEAKER_08]: At work all the time.

578
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying.

579
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:49,737
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very, very thing you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail.

580
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:50,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.

581
00:41:50,317 --> 00:41:52,078
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not a company that sets people up to fail.

582
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:52,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.

583
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:53,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

584
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:57,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like this game is being set up to fail.

585
00:41:58,567 --> 00:41:58,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

586
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:07,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic.

587
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for a Wii game.

588
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,222
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the day, a game is a game.

589
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:15,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though it's a...

590
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:19,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game.

591
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,605
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a really good RPG that any RPG fan needs to experience.

592
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:24,045
[SPEAKER_08]: For real.

593
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:24,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for real.

594
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so what if it doesn't have the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff?

595
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:30,267
[SPEAKER_08]: We pimp classic games here on the show all the time.

596
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:36,788
[SPEAKER_08]: It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games in the slightest because this game does a lot.

597
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,349
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, seriously, when you do play it, you're like, this is a Wii game?

598
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:43,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.

599
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:43,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And they should!

600
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,291
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

601
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:59,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Loki said earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox Lube joke because it was a week old.

602
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:04,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this game is coming out like years after it came out in Japan at this point, right?

603
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:06,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be at least a year since it's out in Japan.

604
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:10,350
[SPEAKER_08]: At least six months from Europe, for sure.

605
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,391
[SPEAKER_08]: And for what reason, we don't know.

606
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:15,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Who already really wanted it has pirated it.

607
00:43:17,537 --> 00:43:18,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

608
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:26,208
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're translating from English to English, English, English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week to finish that.

609
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:30,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean... It's called Find and Replace.

610
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:31,435
Yeah.

611
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:35,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't see how that would be that difficult to go through there.

612
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:39,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the words that's spelled in English English.

613
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?

614
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,880
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to be able to read it.

615
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

616
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was misspelled in the first place.

617
00:43:48,202 --> 00:43:52,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it's spelled correctly, but just not in the way that we may spell it correctly.

618
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:52,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Who gives a shit?

619
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:54,305
[SPEAKER_07]: You can understand it.

620
00:43:54,625 --> 00:44:01,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for one, it's coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it.

621
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:07,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's going to be honest about it and actually buy the game if they pirated it?

622
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:14,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever, at least they haven't said.

623
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:14,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

624
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:16,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

625
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:35,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it comes out and all that shit is still in there.

626
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:37,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all.

627
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what do you want to bet?

628
00:44:59,371 --> 00:44:59,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see, we'll see.

629
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release thing.

630
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:05,393
[SPEAKER_08]: What does this tell you?

631
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:13,136
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really going to do a lot of marketing behind this.

632
00:45:13,156 --> 00:45:15,096
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to see Xenoblade TV commercials.

633
00:45:15,116 --> 00:45:17,297
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to see magazine ads really a whole lot.

634
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:18,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe onesie twosie here and there.

635
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:20,638
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop might promote it a little bit.

636
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:22,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Informer will probably have an ad for it.

637
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:22,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

638
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:23,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Informer will probably have it.

639
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are a big magazine.

640
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:36,236
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's not going to be quite that campaign you would see behind old say Mario Kart 3DS or you know some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going on right now which it just seems like they're just going to here

641
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:43,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's all about exposing themselves to loss.

642
00:45:45,682 --> 00:45:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: History has shown with games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's not going to sell very well.

643
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:58,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at Mad World, look at even some of the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff.

644
00:45:58,694 --> 00:45:59,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It just...

645
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:01,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

646
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:05,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be really cutting edge as far as the technology behind it or something like that.

647
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it can be really edgy.

648
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,382
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a violent game and stuff.

649
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:12,425
[SPEAKER_07]: But people can hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell.

650
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:24,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, for Nintendo to publish this and to bring it over here, it's a risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing money.

651
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:32,520
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not doing any marketing, but spend some money on another Mario Kart game or another Mario game that they know they're going to sell millions of copies of.

652
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:44,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, they want to not lose all their cred with hardcore gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer.

653
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: At least that's what they're trying to

654
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:48,999
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how they're skewing it right now.

655
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:52,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninja Gaiden is going to be on.

656
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,121
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Ghost Recon game that's going to be on.

657
00:46:55,181 --> 00:47:01,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have all these publishers backing it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want the hardcore games to come back.

658
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:04,807
[SPEAKER_07]: all this makes me miss working designs

659
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:26,713
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru GameStop probably paid for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive.

660
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

661
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I worry at the end of the day it's not going to sell as much as it should.

662
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Nintendo's going to say, well, this is why you can't have nice things.

663
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:59,946
[SPEAKER_08]: We were gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall and it didn't sell.

664
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:01,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So no last story for you.

665
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:01,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye.

666
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:02,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's why I say that.

667
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:03,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck them.

668
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:04,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know what?

669
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:05,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need them to bring out fucking RPGs.

670
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,691
[SPEAKER_07]: They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want.

671
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:08,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Because guess what?

672
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,653
[SPEAKER_07]: This world has multiple publishers.

673
00:48:11,113 --> 00:48:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It's full of publishers that bring out RPGs like Atlus or Exceed or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs.

674
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:19,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

675
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need you to fucking bring over anything.

676
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports games, your stupid...

677
00:48:26,357 --> 00:48:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's another goddamn game with Woohoo Island in it, I don't give a fuck if Woohoo Island is in there.

678
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:32,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a landmark.

679
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:35,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something like, oh my god, there's islands in here.

680
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:37,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a character, as they put it.

681
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't fucking care.

682
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:45,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, why don't you put Woohoo Island in fucking Xenoblade or whatever, because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are going to want to see that.

683
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:49,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And hell, Mario is a playable character, since it's a Nintendo published game.

684
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:51,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to have fucking Mario in it.

685
00:48:51,343 --> 00:48:52,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Mamma mia.

686
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:56,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't brain out over here.

687
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:01,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're like, well, see, we listened to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through.

688
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:02,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fuck you.

689
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:02,953
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

690
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:09,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit, and sure, people are going to cream themselves over goddamn Zelda.

691
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:12,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair... I was going to say, hold on.

692
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:14,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

693
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward Sword...

694
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing.

695
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:20,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it myself.

696
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:26,552
[SPEAKER_08]: But that Mario 3DS game, I will tell you firsthand, is that good?

697
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:27,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

698
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:31,934
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy.

699
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:33,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a Xenoblade.

700
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:34,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different type of game.

701
00:49:34,996 --> 00:49:36,677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an adventure game, if you will.

702
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an RPG.

703
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an adventure game.

704
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:40,098
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

705
00:49:54,835 --> 00:49:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

706
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they never did it again.

707
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:14,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

708
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,857
[SPEAKER_07]: They did it once in Endless Ocean.

709
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:17,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But who gives a fuck?

710
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:18,479
[SPEAKER_07]: No one bought Endless Ocean.

711
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,162
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game.

712
00:50:21,202 --> 00:50:24,324
[SPEAKER_07]: If I want to go snorkeling, I will go outside and go snorkeling.

713
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:26,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to play a game to simulate that.

714
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:33,852
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was like the two times that they ever used that stupid SD memory card slot for anything other than later on.

715
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:36,174
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?

716
00:50:36,641 --> 00:51:03,268
[SPEAKER_07]: it's because they do stupid shit because now everyone's like oh look look Project Rainfall worked no no they did it so they could save face so they're like see we care about the hardcore gamer buy the Wii U we're gonna put out hardcore games for it then you buy the Wii U and you're gonna get fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more fucking Mario games and more Mario games oh and there's gonna be a Zelda there because you know that's a hardcore game now and maybe a Metroid that's gonna suck

717
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:07,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting.

718
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:13,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And RDGSinge in our chatroom says, The new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year.

719
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:19,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you can read into it.

720
00:51:19,378 --> 00:51:23,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games?

721
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:26,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you can, but certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about?

722
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:27,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta say...

723
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:31,228
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

724
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:54,329
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all anybody could talk about.

725
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody shared the stage.

726
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:59,555
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good games.

727
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:04,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever, and some other good Wii games.

728
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:12,008
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or sold their Wii because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to play anymore.

729
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:12,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is my Wii?

730
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,471
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so it's like, well, who cares?

731
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:18,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, Skyward Sword, one system.

732
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Skyrim, on a bunch of systems and PCs.

733
00:52:21,112 --> 00:52:23,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking about it.

734
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,174
[SPEAKER_07]: But once again, RPG, adventure game.

735
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:27,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Different.

736
00:52:27,194 --> 00:52:27,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely different.

737
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.

738
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:30,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's definitely not for Grandma.

739
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:34,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal to a lot of people.

740
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:39,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be honest, I mean, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind of a risky move for them.

741
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:40,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, they're...

742
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:48,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Their big thing was let's get non-gamers into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.

743
00:52:49,895 --> 00:52:50,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but there's a problem.

744
00:52:50,595 --> 00:52:51,836
[SPEAKER_07]: They were non-gamers for a reason.

745
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:52,996
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't play games.

746
00:52:53,736 --> 00:53:03,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii Party didn't sell very well because no one buys games that are non-gamers.

747
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:13,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario may have sold well for some of the stuff because, once again, you're convincing them it's a party game, but Skyward Sword, not a party game, not really anything that non-gamers are going to be interested in.

748
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:14,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It is kind of...

749
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:27,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey fans of the series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey we're still considering you and it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform but

750
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:36,431
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever, I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care.

751
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:37,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to buy it.

752
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:40,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when they said GameStop only, I'm really not going to buy it.

753
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:42,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta be honest.

754
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April.

755
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I am leaning towards, I think I might buy it.

756
00:53:50,484 --> 00:53:56,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good game at the end of the day despite my displeasure of how they're fucking this up.

757
00:53:57,607 --> 00:54:09,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein that DarkSakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on.

758
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a piece of gaming history.

759
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:15,974
[SPEAKER_11]: We have almost everything that Working Designs put out.

760
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:17,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing.

761
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:18,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of one of those things for me.

762
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:48,398
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah, I don't give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. They'll use probably the touchpad for some other goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for.

763
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:48,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

764
00:54:48,898 --> 00:54:49,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

765
00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:57,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I may get in on 3DS, but I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that has all these classic tracks.

766
00:54:57,763 --> 00:54:59,904
[SPEAKER_08]: What if the Mario game is really good?

767
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:03,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Mario 3DS Land or whatever the hell it's called.

768
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario 3D Land.

769
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo

770
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:51,079
[SPEAKER_07]: and a lot of games have sold me the systems you know Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation but and there's a lot of Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation there was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii but you know what I bought the Wii and I played some of those games and haven't really touched it since played a little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back but I mean I kind of was like it's kind of a waste of my money

771
00:55:51,886 --> 00:56:08,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want to make that mistake again Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on But I'm sure we'll get lots of emails on it this week Oh wait, you can't email us Actually no, the email should be fixed mid-week So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, we've got more news to cover So I'm going to go back to Loki

772
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:24,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's see here, let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool, and I actually had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind of reinvigorated it.

773
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:39,314
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which I'm not too familiar with those games,

774
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:42,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.

775
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:13,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware.

776
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:26,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And EA, I guess they've given, they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high quality RPG titles to a fast growing, highly engaged core gamer crowd.

777
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:34,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also saying, you know, planning on bringing stuff to, you know, social platforms like Facebook and stuff.

778
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:37,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe seeing like Bioware games on Facebook and stuff.

779
00:57:37,295 --> 00:57:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there.

780
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:43,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been seeing it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook, too.

781
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:45,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so more like that type of game.

782
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.

783
00:57:51,222 --> 00:57:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's BioWare Sacramento now.

784
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:53,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

785
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because that's where we, if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered is in Sacramento.

786
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:00,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a little investigative journalism, if you will.

787
00:58:01,008 --> 00:58:02,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to figure out where these guys are located.

788
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:05,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know if they were downtown or if they were like a suburb.

789
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:07,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, do you know where they are downtown?

790
00:58:07,493 --> 00:58:08,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I found this fascinating.

791
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:13,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, because their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is.

792
00:58:13,797 --> 00:58:15,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I Googled it and put it in the maps.

793
00:58:16,018 --> 00:58:17,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what they are next door to?

794
00:58:20,871 --> 00:58:26,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The Depot Oh, fun Do you know what The Depot is, our international audience?

795
00:58:27,393 --> 00:58:42,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the gay bar downtown The gay bar It's right at the corner of where all the gay bars are down there I think it's hilarious, Bioware Sacramento Bioware is now officially next door to a gay bar

796
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just whatever.

797
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:55,945
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just kind of funny because, you know, especially BioWare has also been kind of one of the leading companies in kind of breaking down that barrier in a lot of their storytelling, too.

798
00:58:56,026 --> 00:58:59,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff.

799
00:58:59,548 --> 00:59:01,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan's tried and they've got positions on the website.

800
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of it's like design stuff, too.

801
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:03,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really should.

802
00:59:04,732 --> 00:59:05,493
[SPEAKER_08]: You should look into that.

803
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:07,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in fact, we should...

804
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:11,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, now there's gaming companies starting to pop up here.

805
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,318
[SPEAKER_08]: There's us.

806
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:15,000
[SPEAKER_08]: There's BioWare Sacramento.

807
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:19,143
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the Prima Games people are actually here too, the strategy guys that come out of there.

808
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:21,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have a luncheon.

809
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a short luncheon.

810
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:26,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, two people.

811
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:32,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to rent out the back room at the Spaghetti Factory, which is across the street from BioWare Sacramento.

812
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:35,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Sacramento's not on the website yet.

813
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:37,514
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but go to their old name.

814
00:59:37,914 --> 00:59:39,856
[SPEAKER_08]: The ClickNation or whatever, it's on there.

815
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,057
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of that's probably changed.

816
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

817
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I applied with them before as ClickNation.

818
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:45,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

819
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:48,199
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

820
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,920
[SPEAKER_08]: A little more gaming moving into our backyard.

821
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,560
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

822
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,601
[SPEAKER_08]: All said and done.

823
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:53,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck to them.

824
00:59:53,841 --> 01:00:01,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but especially with... Here's where I could see this going.

825
01:00:01,944 --> 01:00:06,025
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are very excited about The Old Republic, which Bioware is a part of.

826
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:13,447
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can find the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think they'll be a step ahead of Warcraft.

827
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Because World of Warcraft...

828
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:19,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they've kind of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great.

829
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,677
[SPEAKER_08]: They just kind of publish like, hey, my character got this achievement.

830
01:00:21,737 --> 01:00:23,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, look at this 3D model of my character.

831
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:25,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And it always seems to break whenever there's a new patch.

832
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:30,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, Blizzard has not been interfacing with Facebook very well.

833
01:00:30,228 --> 01:00:33,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a chance where BioWare could maybe get a step up.

834
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:36,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows if these will be the guys to do it or not.

835
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:38,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So pretty cool.

836
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:39,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun stuff going on in the backyard.

837
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:40,960
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

838
01:00:41,821 --> 01:00:42,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

839
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:46,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of reports coming out of Black Friday sales.

840
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:50,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, Black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving here in the U.S.

841
01:00:50,085 --> 01:00:53,708
[SPEAKER_08]: because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day.

842
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And now some of the sales numbers are in.

843
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:55,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently...

844
01:00:57,845 --> 01:01:01,147
[SPEAKER_08]: and Loki will love this following up with the rants he was just saying there.

845
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:10,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo of America in an interview with USA Today mentioned that Super Mario 3D Land has become the fastest selling portable Mario game ever.

846
01:01:11,055 --> 01:01:13,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Land on the Game Boy Mario Advance

847
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever, it is the fastest selling game ever.

848
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:36,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It moved half a million copies since November 13th.

849
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,759
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS system sales are up, way up too.

850
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:42,401
[SPEAKER_08]: System sales up 325% for the week of November 20th.

851
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:46,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.

852
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,523
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii had its biggest Black Friday ever.

853
01:01:51,903 --> 01:01:55,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Half a million systems sold on Black Friday alone.

854
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:59,291
[SPEAKER_07]: They needed that because they were not selling well at all.

855
01:01:59,531 --> 01:02:02,914
[SPEAKER_08]: The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, 535,000 copies, fastest selling Zelda in history.

856
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,450
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

857
01:02:09,031 --> 01:02:11,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of stuff coming out of Nintendo.

858
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too.

859
01:02:13,493 --> 01:02:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: They moved almost a million Xbox 360s on the week of Black Friday.

860
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:22,038
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't say specifically Black Friday, but like just under a million 360s.

861
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:23,579
[SPEAKER_08]: 750,000 connects that same week.

862
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:30,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of surprised that the Kinect had such a huge year.

863
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:34,606
[SPEAKER_08]: There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on at the Kinect right now, except maybe like Dance Central 2 is cool.

864
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,587
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of games out for the Kinect, though.

865
01:02:36,907 --> 01:02:38,068
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of games out.

866
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:39,329
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of garbage.

867
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:42,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are out.

868
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:43,072
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's some good stuff.

869
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:52,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox website because they're like, Kinect for core, like as in hardcore gamers, and they have like a picture of Forza on there.

870
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:57,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, because it has head tracking, it has some voice commands, that's hardly a Kinect game.

871
01:02:57,901 --> 01:03:24,387
[SPEAKER_08]: and Just Dance 3 which is a Kinect game but this is a franchise that was really popular on the Wii between November 20th and 26th Just Dance 3 sold 700,000 copies lots ABBA You Can Dance no sales figures on that just right now but I'm telling you I didn't talk about that game the other week it's fabulous

872
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:25,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Rob.

873
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:29,480
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura watched me play Abba, You Can Dance on the Wii.

874
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:29,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

875
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the gayest thing I've ever seen.

876
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:35,884
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a song where- It's really something.

877
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:37,766
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a song where- You gotta see it.

878
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:38,226
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta see it.

879
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:39,066
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a ballerina.

880
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:39,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

881
01:03:40,027 --> 01:03:41,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rob was trying to go in point.

882
01:03:41,988 --> 01:03:48,112
[SPEAKER_08]: You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs, and it has a little ballerina on the screen, so you have to do little ballerina dances.

883
01:03:48,273 --> 01:03:49,173
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hilarious.

884
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:49,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that Fernando?

885
01:03:50,454 --> 01:03:52,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was The Winner Takes It All or something.

886
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Fernando.

887
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:53,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

888
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:54,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

889
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:54,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

890
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,219
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's The Winter Takes It All, I think.

891
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,599
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it.

892
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,861
[SPEAKER_11]: That was when we had to do the hand sweepy thing.

893
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:04,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

894
01:04:06,463 --> 01:04:06,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

895
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:10,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I have blurry photos of Rob.

896
01:04:11,638 --> 01:04:13,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I have blurry photos of Rob.

897
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,062
[SPEAKER_08]: That better not end up on the internet.

898
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:16,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I will destroy you.

899
01:04:17,082 --> 01:04:19,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call you Dance Squatch.

900
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:22,827
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.

901
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:23,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Shush.

902
01:04:23,628 --> 01:04:25,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with some release dates.

903
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:32,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to travel around the world and check out games coming out soon, although it's probably dried up quite a bit moving past Black Friday now.

904
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:36,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's usually December is quite a dead month.

905
01:04:36,102 --> 01:04:42,349
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are probably going to be just a couple titles.

906
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:46,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But this week we had Mario Kart 7, well today, that's on the 3DS.

[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.

916
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:05,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my Wii died of dysentery.

917
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think that's why I haven't played it.

918
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that is it.

919
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:15,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, then let's move on to Japan and talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there.

[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine...

924
01:06:35,006 --> 01:06:40,808
[SPEAKER_08]: They've localized everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the menus and things.

925
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:43,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but that's interesting.

926
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:44,249
[SPEAKER_08]: They are bringing that out in Japan.

[SPEAKER_07]: They have a trailer that shows it.

936
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:17,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was on Kotaku they were saying, which language trailer is the most epic?

937
01:07:20,223 --> 01:07:27,331
[SPEAKER_07]: and they had Japanese and German and French and a whole bunch of stuff.

946
01:07:54,855 --> 01:07:55,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling moved already.

947
01:07:55,796 --> 01:07:56,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about you guys.

948
01:07:56,517 --> 01:07:57,779
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of talking.

949
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,185
[SPEAKER_03]: God, this game is really good.

950
01:08:16,265 --> 01:08:19,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have to say that that's an example of the Japanese voice acting.

951
01:08:19,106 --> 01:08:19,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds really good.

952
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:23,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be reading this in pig Latin and I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic!

953
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:43,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire thing, but there you go.

954
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:46,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.

955
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:47,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So props to them.

956
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,030

[SPEAKER_08]: That's a role-playing game.

959
01:08:56,353 --> 01:08:59,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if that ties into the old-ass Wizardry series from back in the day.

960
01:08:59,355 --> 01:08:59,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably does.

975
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:26,167
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a big Half-Life logo with the three.

976
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:26,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

977
01:10:27,318 --> 01:10:28,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

978
01:10:45,444 --> 01:10:50,087
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling, but I hope it's true.

979
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:57,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true, but the problem is it could also be a joke.

980
01:10:59,253 --> 01:11:03,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is this something that Valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce?

981
01:11:03,535 --> 01:11:07,878
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably would want to show off the new engine, obviously, because it would be a new engine.

982
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:09,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd imagine so.

983
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess if it's real, maybe something early next year?

984
01:11:12,222 --> 01:11:14,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, what else is Valve working on right now that we know of?

985
01:11:14,865 --> 01:11:15,545
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dota game.

986
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about Dota 2 or whatever.

987
01:11:16,807 --> 01:11:18,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to put the picture up on our Tumblr.

988
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:19,770
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

989
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:25,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And Salacious Popper, Alan, is in our chat right now saying, shaking and crying, shaking and crying.

990
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:27,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm there with you.

991
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:28,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's true.

992
01:11:29,593 --> 01:11:30,554
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people will be very happy.

993
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:31,995
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's true, then I'll need new underwear.

994
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:32,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

995
01:11:34,297 --> 01:11:35,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Valve, try to give us all a little bit of warning.

996
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:37,060
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

997
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:38,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

998
01:11:39,982 --> 01:11:41,183
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

999
01:11:41,784 --> 01:11:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

1000
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:47,549
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of annoying, I guess.

1001
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:51,392
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember how some of these publishers are doing online passes?

1002
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, EA, being the...

1003
01:11:53,914 --> 01:11:54,735
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1004
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:10,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1005
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:27,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there is a guy that was part of the Neo Games Are Fun forum, and he posted that his copy of EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit contained the online pass that was expired, blocking him from accessing online content.

1006
01:12:28,702 --> 01:12:32,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess there's a bunch of other people that were saying that they ran into the same problem.

1007
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:48,667
[SPEAKER_07]: EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly.

1008
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:53,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Age 2 has an online pass that expires March 31, 2012.

1009
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:11,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement, it's actually listed in there.

1010
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It says redownloading or getting a new pass is free.

1011
01:13:15,332 --> 01:13:23,834
[SPEAKER_07]: EA said, I'm not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the old pass and it somehow changes the date or something.

1012
01:13:24,794 --> 01:13:28,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it's weird though, that they have,

1013
01:13:29,963 --> 01:13:30,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it?

1014
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:31,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it?

1015
01:13:31,044 --> 01:13:32,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I really need to say anything else?

1016
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:32,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1017
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just don't understand why they would do that in the first place.

1018
01:14:03,283 --> 01:14:12,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would be like, for example, if you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically these passes act like download content, and it expires.

1019
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:13,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1020
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:16,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know you like playing that Skyrim DLC.

1021
01:14:17,592 --> 01:14:21,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you finished all your quests in it, because it's expired.

1022
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:24,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we made it out of meat.

1023
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: It's no good anymore.

1024
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:31,894
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't consume this download content.

1025
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You will get sick.

1026
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:42,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just... I know, I know.

1027
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:46,025
[SPEAKER_08]: What else needs to be said?

1028
01:14:46,085 --> 01:14:53,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting punished over and over again.

1029
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:55,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, when is this shit going to stop?

1030
01:14:56,511 --> 01:15:25,264
[SPEAKER_07]: oh and they even said that apparently Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and it even says on the actual card it says was it the service network whatever activation and it says code expires January 1st 2012 so if you're planning on buying Mass Effect 2 I hope you use that code already SMH that's all I have to say SMH

1031
01:15:27,512 --> 01:15:27,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1032
01:15:29,093 --> 01:15:30,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, wait, no, not moving on.

1033
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:51,850
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in California, we have this law, and I think some other states have it too, and the federal has certain protections about it, but if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate to the movie theater for his birthday, and he never uses it, but like three years later he finds it, it's still worth $25.

1034
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:52,750
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't deduct fees, so...

1035
01:15:55,412 --> 01:16:22,792
[SPEAKER_08]: if he wants to take it in for certain amounts I think it's like up to $10 or $25 he can actually go in and say I want the cash back then they have to give him the money for it like they have to do that so it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole kind of around this where things that are worth money like this can expire I'm going to tell you something else though in the state of California gift cards don't expire oh yeah yeah

1036
01:16:24,477 --> 01:16:25,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So why does this stuff expire?

1037
01:16:26,978 --> 01:16:29,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it actually legally would be able to in this state.

1038
01:16:29,559 --> 01:16:31,720
[SPEAKER_08]: See, but it's not real money.

1039
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,320
[SPEAKER_08]: The online pass technically has no value.

1040
01:16:34,921 --> 01:16:35,761
[SPEAKER_08]: It does and it doesn't.

1041
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:37,442
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it seems like a legal loophole.

1042
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,543
[SPEAKER_11]: The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it.

1043
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,024
[SPEAKER_11]: But you've still bought the pass.

1044
01:16:43,744 --> 01:16:45,184
[SPEAKER_11]: You've still bought the card.

1045
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But you didn't really buy the pass.

1046
01:16:47,705 --> 01:16:49,866
[SPEAKER_08]: It was included with your new game.

1047
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:52,624
[SPEAKER_11]: It still has a monetary value attached to it.

1048
01:16:52,644 --> 01:16:55,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The game has a monetary value.

1049
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,929
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the pass actually does have a monetary value.

1050
01:16:57,949 --> 01:16:59,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But you didn't buy the pass, you bought the game.

1051
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:01,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't agree.

1052
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:03,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't agree with what I'm saying.

1053
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just being their lawyer.

1054
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:06,396
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but it's nothing that would stand.

1055
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:08,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1056
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these online passes that you happen to throw in their way guess what you can download any DLC for free now granted if you know Mass Effect 2 or whatever that's not a big deal and you can't play online with you know a JTAG system or something like that but you can download all that download content

1057
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:51,023
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, Saints Row the Third.

1058
01:17:51,443 --> 01:18:04,408
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend that may have a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version of that online pass download content that works just fine.

1059
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, legitimate consumers that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what?

1060
01:18:10,931 --> 01:18:16,193
[SPEAKER_07]: THQ wants to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares.

1061
01:18:16,813 --> 01:18:22,014
[SPEAKER_07]: or they can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle.

1062
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:25,095
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little minor inconvenience, I guess.

1063
01:18:25,815 --> 01:18:27,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and does it stop some used game sales?

1064
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it does.

1065
01:18:29,296 --> 01:18:37,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like that.

1066
01:18:38,398 --> 01:18:38,779
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the way.

1067
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:40,499
[SPEAKER_07]: The sequel to Tiny Tower, tiny text.

1068
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:42,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the way to go about it.

1069
01:18:42,804 --> 01:18:52,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January.

1070
01:18:52,367 --> 01:18:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say they go and buy it in January and they got this code.

1071
01:18:54,347 --> 01:18:56,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, sweet, I can get this free download content.

1072
01:18:56,848 --> 01:18:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And you go put in code invalid.

1073
01:18:58,749 --> 01:18:59,269
[SPEAKER_07]: It's expired.

1074
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:06,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, wouldn't that kind of leave a little sour taste in your mouth once you think twice before buying an EA product again?

1075
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:07,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's just say they bought it.

1076
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Brand new.

1077
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:11,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.

1078
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:16,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet, and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.

1079
01:19:17,822 --> 01:19:19,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would kind of annoy me.

1080
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:23,106
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be like, maybe... What?

1081
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:26,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier!

1082
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, thanks!

1083
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:44,166
[SPEAKER_07]: What I think it comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of when they're going to drop prices of these things, and you see they work in the price of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60.

1084
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:48,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, now we're going to drop it down to $20, and we're going to take the download vote.

1085
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,691
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually.

1086
01:19:50,831 --> 01:19:52,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're giving them too much credit to plan ahead.

1087
01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:55,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's exactly what happened here, is that people didn't plan ahead.

1088
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what's really happening here, is this...

1089
01:19:58,297 --> 01:20:03,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody put the cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well, what about when these things expire?

1090
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when that point came up, somebody just said, ah, fuck them.

1091
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what happens in boardrooms across America.

1092
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:09,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them!

1093
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:12,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1094
01:20:14,763 --> 01:20:15,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Verizon.

1095
01:20:15,663 --> 01:20:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to say fuck them too.

1096
01:20:18,462 --> 01:20:22,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon, but if not, well, fuck them too.

1097
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:25,989
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about Verizon, because this sounds like it could be interesting.

1098
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:29,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that whole streaming TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360?

1099
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:33,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Verizon Fios, I don't know what that is, because we don't have this here.

1100
01:20:33,096 --> 01:20:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse, that type of thing?

1101
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:36,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It's F-I-O-S, it's...

1102
01:20:40,279 --> 01:21:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: FiberOptic Okay Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels from this to your Xbox 360 If you're an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get the Fios TV and Internet service So in other words, as long as you can just turn on your TV and get these channels Now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have Gold as well And you'll get 26 of the channels

1103
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:14,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome, but everybody's reporting on it anyway.

1104
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:22,608
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm with you, because as far as... Oh, you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect.

1105
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:23,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1106
01:21:23,349 --> 01:21:24,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something your TV can't do.

1107
01:21:25,731 --> 01:21:26,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again... Xbox!

1108
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:27,833
[SPEAKER_08]: P-break!

1109
01:21:29,794 --> 01:21:32,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, why do I need to do that?

1110
01:21:33,277 --> 01:21:42,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm telling you, in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote faster than someone can say, pause.

1111
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:45,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference there.

1112
01:21:45,307 --> 01:21:46,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox, pause.

1113
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:48,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ask for a puppy?

1114
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:51,812
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Xbox, pause.

1115
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:53,753
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to watch Jaws?

1116
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox, pause!

1117
01:22:01,127 --> 01:22:04,429
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... Cannot identify you.

1118
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:05,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Please face sensor.

1119
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:11,234
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not old enough to watch this programming.

1120
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:16,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I mean, here's the thing.

1121
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for stuff in addition to my cable company.

1122
01:22:24,048 --> 01:22:33,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, like, for example, say, if I'm ever so inclined to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point?

1123
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:36,175
[SPEAKER_07]: If I have to have cable to watch TV...

1124
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:38,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it without an Xbox.

1125
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:43,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV.

1126
01:22:43,966 --> 01:22:45,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat room to the rescue.

1127
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:46,487
[SPEAKER_08]: The show where every gamer has a voice.

1128
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:48,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this.

1129
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:50,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Alpha Kanatagram in the chat.

1130
01:22:50,768 --> 01:22:57,109
[SPEAKER_08]: If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one.

1131
01:22:58,289 --> 01:22:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Something for the kids room.

1132
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, witty retort.

1133
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:23,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just get another box and okay that's great that's great we can do that I suppose but at the same time I mean I only watch TV in one room I don't need that what about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV in his room

1134
01:23:24,744 --> 01:23:26,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Then he can watch TV in his room.

1135
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:30,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Because by then I'm sure we'll have something better than the Xbox streaming.

1136
01:23:31,346 --> 01:23:36,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream cable, we got a problem.

1137
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:42,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hell, you can get like dish installed like four receivers or whatever.

1138
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:43,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to do that.

1139
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they always say, but we can install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms.

1140
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:48,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like...

1141
01:23:49,672 --> 01:23:50,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm only one person.

1142
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:52,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I can watch TV in one room at a time.

1143
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:54,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need four receivers.

1144
01:23:54,842 --> 01:23:55,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I going to watch?

1145
01:23:55,965 --> 01:24:00,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.

1146
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:03,236
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1147
01:24:04,077 --> 01:24:04,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the internet.

1148
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:07,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck receivers.

1149
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:08,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already paying for a high-speed internet.

1150
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my DVR.

1151
01:24:10,341 --> 01:24:13,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I can watch shit whenever I want on any system.

1152
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:17,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your iPod and stuff.

1153
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:22,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small until you watch a TV show on my iPod.

1154
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:22,910
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um...

1155
01:24:23,717 --> 01:24:24,058
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1156
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:41,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so they're of course not going to do that.

1157
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:46,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So, watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal.

1158
01:24:46,241 --> 01:25:01,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's the thing though that would interest me, is if they're in HD, because I currently don't pay for the HD package, because I chose to go the, I was actually going to go the route of no cable, but they said, hey, for two dollars extra we can give you cable, and I'm like, okay, two bucks, I can do that.

1159
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:03,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Two dollars.

1160
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:33,566
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's actually the additional stuff on top of it like channels that are not on my TV that I'm interested in like if they have gaming channels or something like that ESPN Ocho the Ocho if they have additional stuff that's kind of what I'm interested in as far as the stuff that's offered from Verizon or Dish or DirecTV or whatever or maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently powered on how about that wouldn't that be something

1161
01:25:35,526 --> 01:25:36,026
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1162
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:37,867
[SPEAKER_08]: JD Ross.

1163
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: JD Ross is not working.

1164
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:42,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.

1165
01:25:43,589 --> 01:25:44,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it.

1166
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be the Major Nelson hour.

1167
01:25:49,752 --> 01:25:51,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be the Major Nelson channel.

1168
01:25:51,673 --> 01:25:54,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Just camera fixed on Major Nelson all day long.

1169
01:25:54,674 --> 01:25:56,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Major's miniseries, maybe.

1170
01:25:57,395 --> 01:26:00,176
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we need another news story, please.

1171
01:26:01,522 --> 01:26:02,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Animal Crossing!

1172
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:05,525
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's actually kind of different.

1173
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they say that now, but... You actually play as the mayor, and you can customize your town, and you have a secretary.

1174
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:15,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1175
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:16,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm the mayor?

1176
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:17,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you're the mayor.

1177
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:19,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Do people have to do what I say?

1178
01:26:19,794 --> 01:26:20,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

1179
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:22,835
[SPEAKER_11]: You also have a secretary named Shizu.

1180
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:43,938
[SPEAKER_11]: and the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently too and your clothes you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts so now that I'm the mayor will I be able to evict Tom Nook

1181
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish.

1182
01:26:45,721 --> 01:26:47,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you have to deal with problems?

1183
01:26:47,223 --> 01:26:50,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Will all the animals start occupying on your front lawn?

1184
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:53,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to happen?

1185
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:58,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to have to send out Resetti to mace the villagers of the town?

1186
01:26:59,977 --> 01:27:01,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I finish my story, Rob?

1187
01:27:01,098 --> 01:27:02,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a hands-on mayor.

1188
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take this shit in my own hand.

1189
01:27:03,982 --> 01:27:04,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab the shovel!

1190
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:11,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the bug net and it's time to discipline people.

1191
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:15,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I finish feeding my story, Rob?

1192
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:16,319
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1193
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1194
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:21,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob's shaking and crying.

1195
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,823
[SPEAKER_11]: He's looking forward to this so much.

1196
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:27,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wish somebody other than Nintendo would make these games because then they might be really funny.

1197
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:30,369
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1198
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh.

1199
01:27:54,749 --> 01:28:00,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can actually exchange house designs with people through street pass.

1200
01:28:02,131 --> 01:28:04,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a model home view is what it is.

1201
01:28:04,652 --> 01:28:05,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Loki, you know what this means.

1202
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:08,933
[SPEAKER_09]: You draw cocks on them.

1203
01:28:09,953 --> 01:28:11,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1204
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom Nook has left his store.

1205
01:28:14,675 --> 01:28:15,655
[SPEAKER_11]: He has a new job.

1206
01:28:16,535 --> 01:28:18,236
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the town's real estate agent.

1207
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:22,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Nook's a little asshole.

1208
01:28:26,236 --> 01:28:28,959
[SPEAKER_09]: No wonder the housing market's screwed.

1209
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want Toto KK to be awesome in it forever.

1210
01:28:32,383 --> 01:28:36,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over Animal Crossing.

1211
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:43,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Occupy Nooks I'm just like, really?

1212
01:28:43,478 --> 01:29:07,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Nook, I'm switching to a credit union Hey, you can design your own couch cushions I don't fucking care Well, I'm looking, oh wow Actually, your little character looks a lot different I thought those real people were It's like, wow, that's realistic Some Japanese dude No, what's sad is they're trapped in your little town And they have to sing and dance for you to get out

1213
01:29:08,325 --> 01:29:08,765
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1214
01:29:24,452 --> 01:29:26,333
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay, we had a Japanese trailer earlier.

1215
01:29:26,473 --> 01:29:27,813
[SPEAKER_08]: This can't possibly be any worse.

1216
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:30,454
[SPEAKER_11]: The people actually do look quite a bit different.

1217
01:29:30,474 --> 01:29:31,394
[SPEAKER_11]: The little characters.

1218
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,495
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the developer roundtable.

1219
01:29:33,515 --> 01:29:34,615
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of boring.

1220
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:35,416
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we see the people?

1221
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:37,076
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like peppered throughout the video.

1222
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:58,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That video is about as exciting as Animal Crossing is on the second day.

1223
01:29:59,427 --> 01:29:59,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1224
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably gonna get it in a 3DS.

1225
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:07,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on, Loki.

1226
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:13,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately, it is the end of GamePro.

1227
01:30:13,984 --> 01:30:19,265
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to cease publication altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly.

1228
01:30:20,145 --> 01:30:21,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be their last issue.

1229
01:30:21,926 --> 01:30:26,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, the website is shutting down tomorrow on the 5th.

1230
01:30:27,748 --> 01:30:29,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're done.

1231
01:30:30,328 --> 01:30:30,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1232
01:30:32,389 --> 01:30:33,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say something about that real quick?

1233
01:30:54,728 --> 01:30:55,649
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1234
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1235
01:31:25,865 --> 01:31:26,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1236
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:58,312
[SPEAKER_07]: GamePro, yeah, you know, it was great back in the day when the internet wasn't around.

1237
01:31:58,332 --> 01:32:12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, now everything is digital and print magazines, unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store, then you're not going to do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives...

1238
01:32:13,221 --> 01:32:17,223
[SPEAKER_07]: You really have to buy them or somehow leverage them out of these companies.

1239
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:24,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the stuff that may be in your magazine is already a month old by the time everything rolls around.

1240
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:25,047
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tough.

1241
01:32:26,388 --> 01:32:33,332
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time-sensitive material.

1242
01:32:33,812 --> 01:32:35,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's tough because that's what people want.

1243
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:39,595
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why RetroGamer is a great magazine because you're not expecting to see new stuff in there.

1244
01:32:40,616 --> 01:32:40,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1245
01:32:42,435 --> 01:33:00,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, interesting comment from GameGuru in the chatroom I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no gaming magazine besides PC Gamer My favorite magazine right now is actually Retro Gamer It's a British magazine that's all old video games Oh, the one I just mentioned?

1246
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:12,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Retro Gamer is a very, okay, and keep in mind, my career, what I want to make a career of is print publication.

1247
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:16,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort into it.

1248
01:33:17,213 --> 01:33:19,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Print it on nice, glossy stock.

1249
01:33:20,036 --> 01:33:24,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should warn you, it's going to be rough.

1250
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:39,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta tell you guys about this gaming magazine that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games in there it's a magazine called Retro Gamer I don't know if you've heard of it shut up

1251
01:33:41,909 --> 01:33:42,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1252
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having a lot of overlap with their sister site, IndieGames.com.

1253
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:12,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of the best material out there as being indie related, they're just going to kind of focus mainly on IndieGames.com.

1254
01:34:12,629 --> 01:34:21,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, mainstream game blogs are doing a much better job nowadays, including The Weirder and Alt Links and among the other gaming news.

1255
01:34:21,798 --> 01:34:27,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think a lot of these gaming websites, to be honest, nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.

1256
01:34:27,123 --> 01:34:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, one game blog covered it.

1257
01:34:28,704 --> 01:34:29,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me cover it as well.

1258
01:34:31,775 --> 01:34:35,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Kotaku, I read you daily.

1259
01:34:36,559 --> 01:34:38,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And JoySick, you know.

1260
01:34:38,901 --> 01:34:44,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Kotaku, I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny.

1261
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:50,152
[SPEAKER_07]: How many videos can I watch of someone spawning cheese and having to roll it down a hill?

1262
01:34:50,192 --> 01:34:51,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, it's funny the first time.

1263
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:52,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

1264
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,156
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't need to see that every single time.

1265
01:34:55,817 --> 01:34:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I...

1266
01:34:58,619 --> 01:34:58,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1267
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a lot of sites out there for getting your news.

1268
01:35:03,241 --> 01:35:07,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know, why we don't really cover a lot of the news.

1269
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:12,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, really, do you need another source for, you know, website news?

1270
01:35:12,585 --> 01:35:13,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, we do talk about news.

1271
01:35:14,086 --> 01:35:14,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do.

1272
01:35:14,586 --> 01:35:15,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to have some lols.

1273
01:35:15,867 --> 01:35:16,567
[SPEAKER_08]: To have some lols.

1274
01:35:16,767 --> 01:35:24,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, once again, it's all about, hey, we all have day jobs in our own lives and stuff.

1275
01:35:24,514 --> 01:35:33,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, we're not going to be there right away unless we have some sort of scoop on something, which is not very often because we're not doing this professionally.

1276
01:35:35,383 --> 01:35:45,592
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's impossible for anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that.

1277
01:35:45,812 --> 01:35:48,535
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just a few people and we just can't do it.

1278
01:35:51,797 --> 01:35:52,618
[SPEAKER_08]: We concede.

1279
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:56,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1280
01:35:56,141 --> 01:35:56,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1281
01:35:56,581 --> 01:36:03,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Since Loki talked about how much he sees Skyrim information oversaturating the internet, let's talk about Skyrim.

1282
01:36:03,927 --> 01:36:07,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out this week.

1283
01:36:07,489 --> 01:36:09,671
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1284
01:36:09,871 --> 01:36:10,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently...

1285
01:36:11,672 --> 01:36:12,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, not doing too good.

1286
01:36:13,093 --> 01:36:13,893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of buggy.

1287
01:36:14,413 --> 01:36:17,514
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of users are reporting various issues are going on with the game.

1288
01:36:17,775 --> 01:36:20,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance.

1289
01:36:20,396 --> 01:36:21,296
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be an issue.

1290
01:36:22,456 --> 01:36:22,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it.

1291
01:36:23,197 --> 01:36:25,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the bug list is quite funny actually down at the bottom there.

1292
01:36:26,978 --> 01:36:27,658
[SPEAKER_08]: This here?

1293
01:36:27,818 --> 01:36:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Unofficial bug list.

1294
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, let me look at that.

1295
01:36:30,059 --> 01:36:31,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Just mentioning some of the things.

1296
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:32,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's look at this.

1297
01:36:33,401 --> 01:36:36,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is this like, oh, somebody actually posted this on their own forums, good lord.

1298
01:36:36,904 --> 01:36:39,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's actually the Bethesda forums.

1299
01:36:39,366 --> 01:36:41,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but this isn't Bethesda that posted this.

1300
01:36:41,448 --> 01:36:42,689
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's an unofficial list.

1301
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:43,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yikes.

1302
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:50,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, the Dark Brotherhood Cal does not show a face mask, only seems to work for females, but doesn't show up for males.

1303
01:36:52,777 --> 01:36:54,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, where's the funny stuff?

1304
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Characters getting stuck running.

1305
01:36:59,295 --> 01:37:02,318
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously the resistance is not being there.

1306
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragons flying backwards.

1307
01:37:06,301 --> 01:37:06,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Or erratic.

1308
01:37:07,122 --> 01:37:09,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Destruction trainers are not letting me train.

1309
01:37:10,385 --> 01:37:12,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Markarth guards always try to arrest the player.

1310
01:37:14,789 --> 01:37:17,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Invisibility is being undone by the Shadow Warrior perk.

1311
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:27,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is a funny one.

1312
01:37:27,742 --> 01:37:34,124
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my coworkers was telling me about he was playing and I guess one of his followers died.

1313
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:35,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might have been Lydia.

1314
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:42,568
[SPEAKER_07]: She's the first, well, not really the first follower, but the one you get appointed to by the Jarl.

1315
01:37:44,309 --> 01:37:48,130
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently she got smashed by a troll, no, a giant.

1316
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: She got smashed by a giant.

1317
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:53,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she didn't die, she kind of resurrected herself, but she was still flat.

1318
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:57,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And so she slithered around like a snake for about eight hours in-game.

1319
01:37:58,075 --> 01:37:58,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1320
01:37:59,215 --> 01:38:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: and then he was telling me also later on in the game like another person had died and so he's getting married or whatever and like everybody keeps like walking this is just an outrage this is disgusting this bride keeps like storming off and stuff like that he kept reloading and saying what the hell is going on I can't fucking understand what's going on looks down there's the corpse from the person that died like days ago this is like somehow teleported to your wedding he wanted to come see it that's hilarious

1321
01:38:27,654 --> 01:38:28,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Patches in the future

1322
01:38:49,545 --> 01:38:59,521
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a dead monk in a jail cell, except he looked like he was spasming all over the place.

1323
01:39:00,362 --> 01:39:02,664
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, LOL, Skyrim's buggy, we get it.

1324
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:05,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy.

1325
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:09,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as great as a game as Skyrim is, jeez, it's kind of buggy.

1326
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:13,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we didn't... Remember when they couldn't patch games?

1327
01:39:13,633 --> 01:39:15,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?

1328
01:39:16,335 --> 01:39:17,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you mean like on the Wii?

1329
01:39:17,676 --> 01:39:21,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you were gonna patch them, you just released a new game.

1330
01:39:23,089 --> 01:39:25,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a step back to simpler times.

1331
01:39:25,671 --> 01:39:28,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's a Wii game this week apparently since now that's a classic gaming system.

1332
01:39:29,013 --> 01:39:30,053
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a Wii game.

1333
01:39:30,093 --> 01:39:32,055
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a classic game of the week.

1334
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:42,021
[SPEAKER_11]: The classic game is a game that I've actually done the full version of before but I haven't done this specifically.

1335
01:39:42,521 --> 01:39:43,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas Nights.

1336
01:39:45,283 --> 01:39:46,544
[SPEAKER_11]: My family tradition, damn it.

1337
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:57,598
[SPEAKER_11]: So, basically, you fly around, collect balls, put them in the idea cap machine, and go fight a boss.

1338
01:39:58,138 --> 01:39:58,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1339
01:39:59,978 --> 01:40:00,238
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1340
01:40:00,999 --> 01:40:07,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing, just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees that put the balls in for the family guy jokes.

1341
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:08,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I never saw it.

1342
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:18,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December 1996 in Japan.

1343
01:40:18,885 --> 01:40:20,687
[SPEAKER_11]: It came with the Christmas Saturn bundle.

1344
01:40:21,647 --> 01:40:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere else, it was given away with the purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Raid Heroes, and Next Generation Magazine.

1345
01:40:33,796 --> 01:40:33,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1346
01:40:35,557 --> 01:40:42,102
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually, though, if you got the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't have a slipcover.

1347
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:44,103
[SPEAKER_11]: It just had a transparent one.

1348
01:40:44,723 --> 01:40:46,384
[SPEAKER_11]: But it has its own little special cover.

1349
01:40:46,484 --> 01:40:48,606
[SPEAKER_11]: In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this.

1350
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:51,107
[SPEAKER_11]: It got its own jewel case and everything.

1351
01:40:51,808 --> 01:40:52,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks.

1352
01:40:53,469 --> 01:40:58,552
[SPEAKER_11]: So with this one, it has the full version of one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley.

1353
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:01,494
[SPEAKER_11]: But both Claris and Elliot can play through it.

1354
01:41:02,194 --> 01:41:04,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Elliot couldn't in the full game.

1355
01:41:04,796 --> 01:41:06,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And he has a different layout than Clarissa's one.

1356
01:41:06,578 --> 01:41:07,579
[SPEAKER_11]: His is actually a little harder.

1357
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:17,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, the way the story goes is that they notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in the center of town.

1358
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:21,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So they go into Nightopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.

1359
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:30,806
[SPEAKER_11]: At any rate, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it.

1360
01:41:31,567 --> 01:41:36,371
[SPEAKER_11]: In November and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition.

1361
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:40,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition, but it changed to Winter Nights.

1362
01:41:40,995 --> 01:41:42,896
[SPEAKER_11]: In December, it becomes Christmas Nights.

1363
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:57,770
[SPEAKER_11]: and then the entire area that you go through instead of being all spring-timey turns into wintery places and the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.

1364
01:41:59,252 --> 01:42:02,154
[SPEAKER_11]: You have presents everywhere.

1365
01:42:02,194 --> 01:42:05,397
[SPEAKER_11]: The music, as you can hear, is like a different version of Jingle Bells.

1366
01:42:05,658 --> 01:42:06,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?

1367
01:42:13,603 --> 01:42:15,265
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1368
01:42:33,963 --> 01:42:35,404
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's really fun and cool.

1369
01:42:35,464 --> 01:42:48,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the other neat stuff that happens is that the weather in Spring Valley will change depending on the hour and then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's Day where instead of playing Knights you play as Vialla which is pretty cool.

1370
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:53,593
[SPEAKER_11]: It also has a ton of hidden goodies in it like one of the things that we unlocked last night

1371
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:56,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams

1372
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:21,848
[SPEAKER_11]: and you fight a bouncy ball version of Robotnik slash Eggman.

1373
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:29,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And the music is a remix version of Final Fever which was the final boss music from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD.

1374
01:43:29,658 --> 01:43:32,722
[SPEAKER_11]: As I'm sure I've mentioned before, they changed the US music.

1375
01:43:33,323 --> 01:43:34,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really neat.

1376
01:43:34,324 --> 01:43:36,845
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.

1377
01:43:37,685 --> 01:43:41,207
[SPEAKER_11]: There's even a karaoke mode so you can sing the little theme song.

1378
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:42,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really fun.

1379
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:45,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a freebie, which was even better.

1380
01:43:47,211 --> 01:43:50,552
[SPEAKER_11]: This is back in the day when they would do nice shit for us.

1381
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:51,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you remember?

1382
01:43:53,194 --> 01:43:53,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

1383
01:43:54,415 --> 01:43:56,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's your classic game is Christmas Nights.

1384
01:43:57,813 --> 01:43:59,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Ho, ho, ho.

1385
01:44:00,136 --> 01:44:00,496
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

1386
01:44:00,516 --> 01:44:01,597
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1387
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:02,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1388
01:44:02,038 --> 01:44:02,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Christmas night.

1389
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:13,061
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1390
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:14,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So time appropriate.

1391
01:44:15,163 --> 01:44:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

1392
01:44:16,404 --> 01:44:20,427
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break, guys, but when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1393
01:44:20,527 --> 01:44:25,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced this past week that's going to be lulzy.

1394
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:27,852
[SPEAKER_08]: A special email bag.

1395
01:44:28,032 --> 01:44:30,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody managed to get an email in anyway, even though the email's down.

1396
01:44:30,494 --> 01:44:31,835
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.

1397
01:44:32,076 --> 01:44:34,277
[SPEAKER_08]: And another game going free to play.

1398
01:44:34,297 --> 01:44:38,921
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1399
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:47,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1400
01:44:47,092 --> 01:44:53,935
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live on this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show.

1401
01:44:54,575 --> 01:44:58,016
[SPEAKER_08]: This show's been going on a long time, I just want to point out.

1402
01:44:58,056 --> 01:45:00,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time you say the 37th, I want to go in a row.

1403
01:45:01,858 --> 01:45:08,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So during the break, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays.

1404
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:11,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And some folks were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas?

1405
01:45:12,122 --> 01:45:12,582
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1406
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:44,326
[SPEAKER_08]: and then we'd go to family stuff to eat free food and we're doing stuff with now Alan and I are doing stuff with Alan's side of the family but I don't know when that'll be done we might be done by I seem to remember last year we were kind of out of there by like 4 or 5 so we'll see but I don't want to rush it so I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not probably

1407
01:45:44,346 --> 01:45:48,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, but never say never, right?

1408
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:51,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and eat it live on air.

1409
01:45:51,412 --> 01:45:55,156
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be fun to do, have a Chinese food Christmas special, but we'll see.

1410
01:45:56,537 --> 01:46:01,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not, you guys.

1411
01:46:01,802 --> 01:46:06,887
[SPEAKER_08]: The good news is the next week should be easy, so we'll have one week off for the holidays, and that should be it.

1412
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:15,353
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let you know more about that in the next couple weeks Because believe it or not, Christmas is only about three weeks away from today So, yikes!

1413
01:46:16,294 --> 01:46:20,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Jester Scott in our chatroom says Take a day off, peeps!

1414
01:46:21,878 --> 01:46:25,841
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, we deserve a day off That's what we're getting for the holidays, a day off Let's go to Disneyland

1415
01:46:27,349 --> 01:46:28,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't even tempt me.

1416
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:28,971
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1417
01:46:29,992 --> 01:46:32,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get back into some more gaming news.

1418
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:35,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets.

1419
01:46:35,059 --> 01:46:39,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you get your tweets in because especially since the email bag's been down this week, we're really relying on your tweets.

1420
01:46:40,005 --> 01:46:42,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.

1421
01:46:42,308 --> 01:46:43,810
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have quite as much news.

1422
01:46:44,471 --> 01:46:49,354
[SPEAKER_08]: This half of the show, as we did in the first half of the show, so we definitely need your calls and tweets tonight.

1423
01:46:50,955 --> 01:46:52,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a work injury?

1424
01:46:52,676 --> 01:46:53,136
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on?

1425
01:46:53,196 --> 01:46:54,637
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura says she has a splinter.

1426
01:46:54,657 --> 01:46:55,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Go take care of it!

1427
01:46:55,397 --> 01:46:56,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a splinter!

1428
01:46:56,258 --> 01:46:58,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, go do what you need to do.

1429
01:46:58,699 --> 01:46:59,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki will read some news.

1430
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:00,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take care of it.

1431
01:47:01,241 --> 01:47:02,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.

1432
01:47:02,801 --> 01:47:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do the news, I guess.

1433
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:06,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about...

1434
01:47:08,621 --> 01:47:09,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Zynga.

1435
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:20,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of a franchise with Angry Birds in it.

1436
01:47:20,744 --> 01:47:28,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for a $2.25 billion acquisition from Zynga.

1437
01:47:29,766 --> 01:47:32,467
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a lot of pride right there.

1438
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:34,832
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1439
01:48:05,531 --> 01:48:11,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about that role-playing game that's coming out very soon.

1440
01:48:14,358 --> 01:48:16,699
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can load up the story here, if it'll work.

1441
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,481
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1442
01:48:19,662 --> 01:48:20,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

1443
01:48:20,782 --> 01:48:23,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about... This is great.

1444
01:48:23,965 --> 01:48:24,545
[SPEAKER_07]: South Park.

1445
01:48:25,326 --> 01:48:32,251
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had a lot of okay games, and then, of course, they have to go and...

1446
01:48:34,071 --> 01:48:35,552
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura's bleeding, apparently.

1447
01:48:36,352 --> 01:48:40,713
[SPEAKER_07]: No, um... And now it's come out... I was gonna say something nasty, but I didn't.

1448
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:44,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God, I... I appreciate that you did not say anything.

1449
01:48:45,075 --> 01:48:48,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I was gonna take it there, and then I said, you know what, I'm not gonna take it there.

1450
01:48:48,876 --> 01:48:51,137
[SPEAKER_08]: That would explain a lot about why she's so upset.

1451
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you know what?

1452
01:48:54,824 --> 01:48:57,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Alan would really like for you to come home eventually.

1453
01:48:57,605 --> 01:48:58,746
[SPEAKER_11]: South Park, you were saying?

1454
01:48:59,046 --> 01:48:59,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, South Park.

1455
01:48:59,746 --> 01:49:08,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have an Xbox Live Arcade game, the kind of side-scroller co-op game that's South Park's Tenement's Revenge, which is coming out a little bit later on.

1456
01:49:08,071 --> 01:49:09,111
[SPEAKER_07]: But this isn't what we're talking about.

1457
01:49:09,131 --> 01:49:12,593
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about what was revealed from the new cover of Game Informer.

1458
01:49:12,893 --> 01:49:16,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company that can get exclusives.

1459
01:49:17,555 --> 01:49:18,315
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.

1460
01:49:42,563 --> 01:49:48,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

1461
01:49:49,485 --> 01:49:54,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, what's kind of cool about it, though, is they also have, uh, some details out about it.

1462
01:49:55,027 --> 01:50:01,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about you fitting in, I guess.

1463
01:50:01,949 --> 01:50:05,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be completely customizable.

1464
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:10,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff like that.

1465
01:50:10,952 --> 01:50:11,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1466
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:16,195
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think it's pretty awesome looking.

1467
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:18,276
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying it's going to combine a bunch of different things.

1468
01:50:18,596 --> 01:50:20,778
[SPEAKER_07]: The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.

1469
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:28,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from 7.

1470
01:50:30,204 --> 01:50:36,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, they're saying that, of course, the entire game is going to be 2D or at least look hand-drawn, I guess.

1471
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:41,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta say, I'm a little worried, though, because the other South Park games that have come out today have been kind of crappy.

1472
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, this is a new company doing this.

1473
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:46,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, who did the Nintendo 64 one?

1474
01:50:46,077 --> 01:50:47,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it?

1475
01:50:47,919 --> 01:50:49,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And that one, that was that first-person shooter.

1476
01:50:49,721 --> 01:50:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It really wasn't that good.

1477
01:50:51,122 --> 01:50:58,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, you know, there's been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live Arcade games, like, you know, there's the Let's Play Tower Defense and all that stuff.

1478
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good that it has their input.

1479
01:50:59,070 --> 01:50:59,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1480
01:51:27,266 --> 01:51:27,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1481
01:51:27,607 --> 01:51:28,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited.

1482
01:51:28,109 --> 01:51:29,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd buy it.

1483
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:32,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely check that out.

1484
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:35,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, the demo and so forth is very important.

1485
01:51:35,192 --> 01:51:40,434
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's so funny that South Park is still going after all these years.

1486
01:51:40,454 --> 01:51:41,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons, too.

1487
01:51:41,774 --> 01:51:42,994
[SPEAKER_08]: God, The Simpsons has been on forever.

1488
01:51:43,014 --> 01:51:43,975
[SPEAKER_11]: The Simpsons is still going.

1489
01:51:44,435 --> 01:51:49,096
[SPEAKER_08]: But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of college.

1490
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,877
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, what, 97?

1491
01:51:51,357 --> 01:51:52,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still on the air?

1492
01:51:53,518 --> 01:51:56,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And people talk about, boy, South Park is so old.

1493
01:51:56,558 --> 01:51:57,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means I'm so old.

1494
01:51:58,599 --> 01:52:01,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, I'm older than you.

1495
01:52:01,542 --> 01:52:02,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about Kinect for PC.

1496
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:28,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, but I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week, so here's the deal.

1497
01:52:28,685 --> 01:52:37,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect, and Kinect 2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected, right?

1498
01:52:37,987 --> 01:52:43,269
[SPEAKER_08]: More high-def cameras, all you really need, and maybe a better microphone in there, I don't know, or higher sound sampling.

1499
01:52:43,789 --> 01:52:54,952
[SPEAKER_08]: but apparently it's going to have some other technical stuff in it as well it's going to be able to read lips it will be able to detect the direction that you're facing and recognize your emotional state

1500
01:52:56,323 --> 01:52:56,643
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1501
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, look, a lot of this is just what?

1502
01:53:16,524 --> 01:53:19,468
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device.

1503
01:53:19,989 --> 01:53:23,995
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that it would be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising.

1504
01:53:24,035 --> 01:53:28,060
[SPEAKER_07]: It was stuff that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough camera resolution.

1505
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:28,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't have the power!

1506
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:30,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1507
01:53:30,223 --> 01:53:30,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1508
01:53:55,871 --> 01:54:21,557
[SPEAKER_08]: you know the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing I mean especially for what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth or folks you know that it's going to be really neat I think kind of like it's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now like when they showed FaceTime for the first time and how like deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of like have phone calls so it's pretty awesome so it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up in that regard that's cool yeah very cool

1509
01:54:22,978 --> 01:54:27,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.

1510
01:54:30,769 --> 01:54:32,791
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to go to our email bag.

1511
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's the thing.

1512
01:54:34,232 --> 01:54:39,196
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't really have a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week.

1513
01:54:39,356 --> 01:54:45,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1514
01:54:45,621 --> 01:54:53,607
[SPEAKER_08]: However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, hordehouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning.

1515
01:54:53,988 --> 01:54:59,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of our special guests, all the way from the other side of the pond, Sil, beat me on Skype and said...

1516
01:54:59,608 --> 01:55:00,028
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1517
01:55:23,195 --> 01:55:25,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit, that's right, you need mailbag music.

1518
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:27,860
[SPEAKER_08]: We also love Syl and we'll do whatever she wants.

1519
01:55:27,961 --> 01:55:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean really at the end of the day, right?

1520
01:55:30,123 --> 01:55:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Syl is my hero.

1521
01:55:31,104 --> 01:55:31,665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1522
01:55:37,518 --> 01:55:37,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Email!

1523
01:55:39,079 --> 01:55:39,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, guys.

1524
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:44,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry for what happened to the website, and I hope it will all be resolved quickly.

1525
01:55:45,703 --> 01:55:53,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet, but it seriously made me facepalm, and I'm not even giving anybody the address because it's retarded.

1526
01:55:53,848 --> 01:55:55,229
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Mario Kills Tanuki.

1527
01:55:55,269 --> 01:55:56,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the PETA website.

1528
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:58,671
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really want to find it, find it, but I don't care.

1529
01:55:58,732 --> 01:56:05,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving, so I think a lot of people heard of this.

1530
01:56:06,636 --> 01:56:17,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end, points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our inner beings and morals.

1531
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:23,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game I never felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat.

1532
01:56:24,083 --> 01:56:25,803
[SPEAKER_11]: What is your feeling about what PETA did here?

1533
01:56:26,263 --> 01:56:31,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing up Shermie now and taking measurements.

1534
01:56:32,185 --> 01:56:33,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I haven't said anything.

1535
01:56:33,766 --> 01:56:34,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Love the show, Zil.

1536
01:56:34,788 --> 01:56:35,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Zil.

1537
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,093
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, Shermie...

1538
01:56:39,602 --> 01:56:41,584
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is that ringtone?

1539
01:56:42,384 --> 01:56:46,268
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is Bitches by Mindless Self-Indulgence.

1540
01:56:46,408 --> 01:56:46,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1541
01:56:48,369 --> 01:56:50,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now.

1542
01:56:56,316 --> 01:56:59,138
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.

1543
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:01,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bullshit organization.

1544
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:07,926
[SPEAKER_11]: They put more animals to sleep, or I should just say they murder more animals than they help.

1545
01:57:09,433 --> 01:57:24,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Their second in command, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, their second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal-derived insulin.

1546
01:57:25,139 --> 01:57:25,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

1547
01:57:26,659 --> 01:57:35,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Their main leader is a sociopath who basically has stated that she would rather all humanity die.

1548
01:57:37,032 --> 01:57:39,273
[SPEAKER_11]: and have the world ruled by animals.

1549
01:57:39,873 --> 01:57:40,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just throwing that out there.

1550
01:57:41,434 --> 01:57:41,974
[SPEAKER_11]: She's crazy.

1551
01:57:42,614 --> 01:57:44,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, but animals are so fuzzy-wuzzy.

1552
01:57:44,815 --> 01:57:47,496
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she says that she wants all humans to die.

1553
01:57:48,996 --> 01:57:49,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1554
01:57:50,216 --> 01:57:52,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So Ingrid Newman, I think, is her name.

1555
01:57:53,838 --> 01:58:04,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, we've got this organization that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that

1556
01:58:04,761 --> 01:58:05,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we surprised at all?

1557
01:58:06,122 --> 01:58:14,206
[SPEAKER_11]: That they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at basically their target age group, which is gamer age.

1558
01:58:15,087 --> 01:58:22,090
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to get them young, get them in our little bracket, because we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.

1559
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:25,192
[SPEAKER_11]: PETA makes so much money.

1560
01:58:25,834 --> 01:58:27,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Peta is smart.

1561
01:58:27,555 --> 01:58:28,436
[SPEAKER_08]: They are very smart.

1562
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:33,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community.

1563
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,121
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the first time they've done something like this.

1564
01:58:35,782 --> 01:58:42,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And they know that they will get completely free advertising for a very long time from doing something like this.

1565
01:58:42,867 --> 01:58:45,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how they kind of went back on it and said, oh, it's just a joke.

1566
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever their weird-ass reasoning was or whatever...

1567
01:58:50,393 --> 01:59:01,742
[SPEAKER_08]: An audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought, the majority of which probably wouldn't give them a second thought, couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.

1568
01:59:01,762 --> 01:59:06,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have a show unexpectedly, remember?

1569
01:59:07,027 --> 01:59:08,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's when this all kind of came up.

1570
01:59:09,048 --> 01:59:19,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So PETA's very smart at what they're doing, and this is all part of a calculated plan to drive more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer.

1571
01:59:20,197 --> 01:59:28,019
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you sit there in your inbox and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or you won the lottery or congratulations.

1572
01:59:28,039 --> 01:59:32,721
[SPEAKER_08]: You're really the millionth visitor to this website and you really did win this.

1573
01:59:33,481 --> 01:59:36,162
[SPEAKER_08]: But if one person falls for it, then...

1574
01:59:37,839 --> 01:59:41,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I really hate how an organization can tell us that we are being influenced by games.

1575
02:00:06,196 --> 02:00:10,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was really important because that is not unique to PETA.

1576
02:00:10,498 --> 02:00:13,220
[SPEAKER_08]: That is absolutely not unique to this organization.

1577
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:16,781
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just the most recent example of this.

1578
02:00:17,161 --> 02:00:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for political office, mind you.

1579
02:00:24,925 --> 02:00:26,866
[SPEAKER_08]: This is far and above any organization.

1580
02:00:26,946 --> 02:00:29,047
[SPEAKER_08]: People that actually wield actual power.

1581
02:00:29,927 --> 02:00:41,050
[SPEAKER_08]: that think gamers are stupid, gamers are easily influenced, gamers care nothing about more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.

1582
02:00:41,511 --> 02:00:51,934
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when the reality is, especially now thanks to Facebook, guess what?

1583
02:00:51,994 --> 02:00:52,974
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all gamers.

1584
02:00:54,688 --> 02:01:11,583
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing as opposed to what they were doing before when PETA made fun of what was it Super Meat Boy was one of the games they did before they did a Cooking Mama one too most people don't know Super Meat Boy most people don't know Cooking Mama

1585
02:01:12,323 --> 02:01:27,030
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody fucking knows Mario and Mario especially Mario 3 what person in their 20s or 30s or hell even most teens that weren't born when this game came out what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3

1586
02:01:28,305 --> 02:01:29,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1587
02:01:45,047 --> 02:01:45,367
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

1588
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:48,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew plenty of my friends.

1589
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:49,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Their parents played Mario with them.

1590
02:01:50,533 --> 02:01:59,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no.

1591
02:02:00,183 --> 02:02:01,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this Mario game.

1592
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:02,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're being stupid.

1593
02:02:02,906 --> 02:02:03,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1594
02:02:03,867 --> 02:02:08,472
[SPEAKER_08]: People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like that that they didn't know.

1595
02:02:08,813 --> 02:02:15,440
[SPEAKER_08]: But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki suit... Like, here's the...

1596
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And still goes on in the email to say something like, I used to play Super Mario 3, and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat and wear him like a hat.

1597
02:02:24,127 --> 02:02:31,973
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is, I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch 6 and 7 year olds when they play.

1598
02:02:32,014 --> 02:02:34,315
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them are little freaks, and I mean that in a good way.

1599
02:02:34,636 --> 02:02:40,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of them will pretend to be Tanooki Mario, like, woo, I'm flying, or I'm a Tanooki statue, you know, they'll stay, I mean...

1600
02:02:41,241 --> 02:02:43,443
[SPEAKER_08]: and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb.

1601
02:02:43,463 --> 02:02:44,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But guess what?

1602
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:46,325
[SPEAKER_08]: When you were six or seven, you were that dumb.

1603
02:02:46,765 --> 02:02:47,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1604
02:02:47,706 --> 02:02:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So you didn't want to skin your cat.

1605
02:02:49,868 --> 02:02:51,669
[SPEAKER_08]: You just wanted to be Tanuki Mario.

1606
02:02:52,109 --> 02:02:53,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario was your freaking hero.

1607
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure me, baby.

1608
02:02:54,591 --> 02:02:56,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to skin you, but I will use you as socks.

1609
02:02:57,573 --> 02:02:58,934
[SPEAKER_11]: All I have to do is have her sit on my feet.

1610
02:02:59,515 --> 02:02:59,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1611
02:03:00,015 --> 02:03:05,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that...

1612
02:03:05,419 --> 02:03:07,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want to skin the cat.

1613
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to be a statue.

1614
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:11,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted the freaking Hammer Brothers suit.

1615
02:03:11,161 --> 02:03:12,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to save the princess.

1616
02:03:12,782 --> 02:03:16,623
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because we were 6, 7, whatever age when this game came out.

1617
02:03:16,783 --> 02:03:18,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to throw hammers at people.

1618
02:03:18,104 --> 02:03:19,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Peeta, you're being dumb.

1619
02:03:19,564 --> 02:03:20,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to throw hammers at people.

1620
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:22,746
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

1621
02:03:23,086 --> 02:03:23,626
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my point.

1622
02:03:24,927 --> 02:03:27,248
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once.

1623
02:03:28,969 --> 02:03:31,571
[SPEAKER_11]: That could still happen.

1624
02:03:31,651 --> 02:03:34,233
[SPEAKER_08]: We could still make that dream come true, DarkSakura.

1625
02:03:34,714 --> 02:03:40,758
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point that I would like to bring up to our listeners of Voting Age.

1626
02:03:41,038 --> 02:03:43,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, and then I want to go to the chat room.

1627
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:49,024
[SPEAKER_11]: The people with power are trying to make these decisions for us.

1628
02:03:50,465 --> 02:03:52,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, every time that you say, fuck it,

1629
02:03:54,199 --> 02:04:10,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time you say, I can't make a difference, or I don't feel like it, every time you display apathy, you're basically saying, do whatever you want to, I don't care.

1630
02:04:11,223 --> 02:04:18,164
[SPEAKER_11]: That means the shit that's going on in the world right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault.

1631
02:04:19,929 --> 02:04:24,314
[SPEAKER_11]: because you didn't vote for the people who need to be the ones to make the change.

1632
02:04:25,055 --> 02:04:35,027
[SPEAKER_11]: You get enough people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.

1633
02:04:37,791 --> 02:04:38,592
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see change then.

1634
02:04:39,537 --> 02:04:41,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Very serious point and very much needed.

1635
02:04:41,419 --> 02:04:47,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody better make sure they vote or you can't complain about these things like SOPA and things like that because you elected these people.

1636
02:04:47,485 --> 02:04:50,988
[SPEAKER_11]: My third catchphrase then, because you know my first one is welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.

1637
02:04:52,009 --> 02:04:53,711
[SPEAKER_11]: The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1638
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:56,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, change doesn't happen until you make it happen.

1639
02:04:57,228 --> 02:04:59,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was going to be Reject False Icons, but that works.

1640
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:00,672
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I stole from Gorillaz.

1641
02:05:00,852 --> 02:05:01,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

1642
02:05:02,414 --> 02:05:04,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Technically, I stole the first one from Space Harrier.

1643
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:08,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to some lols from our chatroom, because the chatroom is bringing the lols, and it's talking about Tanuki Mario.

1644
02:05:09,442 --> 02:05:12,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo in chat says, I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario.

1645
02:05:13,487 --> 02:05:17,191
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Dollar Bill says, the only time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned.

1646
02:05:18,612 --> 02:05:24,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says, these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.

1647
02:05:26,176 --> 02:05:32,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And also says, PETA never complained about Angry Birds, a game where you slingshot birds into buildings.

1648
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:33,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Pigs.

1649
02:05:33,841 --> 02:05:35,442
[SPEAKER_08]: All I have to say, wait.

1650
02:05:37,123 --> 02:05:39,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote.

1651
02:05:41,445 --> 02:05:42,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Including my husband.

1652
02:05:42,766 --> 02:05:43,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unless you're, you know, 17.

1653
02:05:44,627 --> 02:05:46,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you're a voting age...

1654
02:05:48,577 --> 02:05:52,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house.

1655
02:05:53,581 --> 02:05:54,842
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you mail it back in.

1656
02:05:55,402 --> 02:05:56,483
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what that requires?

1657
02:05:56,843 --> 02:05:58,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk into the mailbox.

1658
02:06:00,666 --> 02:06:00,966
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1659
02:06:01,627 --> 02:06:03,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says, sadly, I don't live in the U.S.

1660
02:06:04,429 --> 02:06:06,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I meant for people who live here.

1661
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: People who can vote.

1662
02:06:08,492 --> 02:06:11,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Or in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote.

1663
02:06:13,126 --> 02:06:15,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Your votes matter in your country, in your community.

1664
02:06:15,447 --> 02:06:18,329
[SPEAKER_11]: You make the difference in your own damn community.

1665
02:06:18,369 --> 02:06:20,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life.

1666
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:21,790
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

1667
02:06:22,631 --> 02:06:22,971
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1668
02:06:23,811 --> 02:06:27,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I think DarkSakura is ready for the F use of the week, or maybe she already did it.

1669
02:06:27,973 --> 02:06:29,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get the music anyway.

1670
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:45,391
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to Bones006 today.

1671
02:06:47,731 --> 02:06:51,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... Who, uh... Can't spell.

1672
02:06:52,413 --> 02:06:53,553
[SPEAKER_11]: What has an H in it.

1673
02:06:54,053 --> 02:06:55,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The word is about.

1674
02:06:55,574 --> 02:06:55,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Bout.

1675
02:06:56,134 --> 02:06:57,674
[SPEAKER_11]: B-O-U-T is like a battle.

1676
02:06:58,435 --> 02:06:59,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a match.

1677
02:06:59,835 --> 02:07:01,836
[SPEAKER_11]: People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E.

1678
02:07:02,016 --> 02:07:03,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't has an apostrophe in it.

1679
02:07:03,616 --> 02:07:04,056
[SPEAKER_11]: And a period.

1680
02:07:04,156 --> 02:07:05,557
[SPEAKER_11]: You are part of what is wrong with the country.

1681
02:07:06,377 --> 02:07:07,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody else, fucking vote.

1682
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:09,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1683
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:10,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1684
02:07:12,439 --> 02:07:12,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1685
02:07:13,217 --> 02:07:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

1686
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:19,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'd just say FU2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.

1687
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so much time in the day.

1688
02:07:25,429 --> 02:07:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: my FU of the week just goes to like being like really really busy and just there is so much going on right now and like you know like somebody said to me last night like oh boo hoo you have the biggest problem that you have too much on your social calendar to do but I just it can be exhausting and just you know sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't want to piss people off it's just rough so F you to all that

1689
02:07:54,656 --> 02:07:56,557
[SPEAKER_08]: The holidays are about loving, dammit.

1690
02:07:58,258 --> 02:08:01,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do have a little tiny one, people.

1691
02:08:03,162 --> 02:08:11,407
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to everybody who says that Christmas is becoming less Christian because it wasn't Christian to begin with.

1692
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:14,169
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very, very, very, very pagan.

1693
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

1694
02:08:16,391 --> 02:08:17,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't we all just get along?

1695
02:08:17,912 --> 02:08:18,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on.

1696
02:08:18,592 --> 02:08:19,673
[SPEAKER_11]: It was about burning trees.

1697
02:08:21,636 --> 02:08:22,897
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that not pagan?

1698
02:08:23,277 --> 02:08:25,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?

1699
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:27,900
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth.

1700
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:29,321
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but he could make water into wine.

1701
02:08:30,242 --> 02:08:32,103
[SPEAKER_11]: He also wasn't... Never mind.

1702
02:08:34,444 --> 02:08:35,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to say this.

1703
02:08:35,585 --> 02:08:38,327
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom tried to have this argument with me and you were there.

1704
02:08:38,627 --> 02:08:40,088
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where the gay pie party came from.

1705
02:08:41,109 --> 02:08:44,931
[SPEAKER_11]: She says, well, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?

1706
02:08:46,693 --> 02:08:47,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Hanukkah was always Jewish.

1707
02:08:49,637 --> 02:09:17,588
[SPEAKER_11]: um yeah that made no sense mom well also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah no it's actually menorah is a Hebrew word for a candelabra the technical term is a Hanukkiah so it is how about some rapid fire gaming news Loki you have a lot of news to talk to us about we're gonna quickly go through some stories let's talk about Rhythm Heaven it's coming to the Wii in North America and

1708
02:09:18,152 --> 02:09:25,177
[SPEAKER_07]: In February, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and this was announced via Nintendo Power.

1709
02:09:25,217 --> 02:09:26,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say that's pretty legitimate.

1710
02:09:29,981 --> 02:09:31,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the game, to be honest.

1711
02:09:32,003 --> 02:09:34,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it on the DS, did not care for Rhythm Heaven.

1712
02:09:34,706 --> 02:09:35,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Just not my thing.

1713
02:09:36,307 --> 02:09:37,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are really into it, though.

1714
02:09:37,548 --> 02:09:39,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it enough.

1715
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:43,634
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like rhythm games, by all means, go ahead and check it out.

1716
02:09:45,055 --> 02:09:51,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there is supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow you to shoot some 3D video.

1717
02:09:52,602 --> 02:09:55,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time.

1718
02:09:55,645 --> 02:09:58,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It is scheduled, though, for this week on December 8th.

1719
02:09:58,987 --> 02:10:00,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can look forward to that.

1720
02:10:00,789 --> 02:10:16,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, that will give you the 3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on.

1721
02:10:17,281 --> 02:10:19,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So more Mario Kart tracks, we can only hope.

1722
02:10:20,743 --> 02:10:24,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight.

1723
02:10:25,366 --> 02:10:29,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to be a brand new Microsoft Flight sim.

1724
02:10:30,468 --> 02:10:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, they haven't really unveiled too many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that series.

1725
02:10:39,512 --> 02:10:42,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely popular, so that'll be cool.

1726
02:10:43,454 --> 02:10:49,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, last but not least, or actually, this is even closer to last year,

1727
02:10:49,797 --> 02:10:54,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of thought the theory had something like this, but it's still neat to see anyways.

1728
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:58,001
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new device out called the Supa Boy.

1729
02:10:58,782 --> 02:11:06,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the Supa Boy does is allows you to play Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo cartridges, on the go.

1730
02:11:06,405 --> 02:11:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those devices that you can play.

1731
02:11:09,007 --> 02:11:11,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a handheld system.

1732
02:11:11,228 --> 02:11:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make like a mini console of sorts.

1733
02:11:18,391 --> 02:11:22,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's available for purchase as well.

1734
02:11:22,634 --> 02:11:24,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I believe it's on Amazon.

1735
02:11:24,715 --> 02:11:26,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what this thing goes for here.

1736
02:11:26,116 --> 02:11:26,096
$80.

1737
02:11:27,217 --> 02:11:31,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost cheaper, I think, than buying Super Nintendo.

1738
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:40,425
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to play something portable without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go.

1739
02:11:40,766 --> 02:11:41,926
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way to go about it.

1740
02:11:43,147 --> 02:11:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched Tetris on the iOS, uh, system, or platform, if you will, but there is a little issue with it.

1741
02:11:58,415 --> 02:11:59,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's $30 a year.

1742
02:12:01,996 --> 02:12:08,021
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can basically... Thanks Apple for opening up the subscription thing to everybody.

1743
02:12:08,121 --> 02:12:11,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate that because EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?

1744
02:12:12,203 --> 02:12:18,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It does have some new features including Galaxy Mode and Marathon One Touch Mode, whatever that means.

1745
02:12:19,288 --> 02:12:43,901
[SPEAKER_07]: and also it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay and of course you can subscribe to the Tea Club which offers exclusive access to new mobile challenges and content you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you can drop $30 for a full year and of course the game costs you money anyways it's 99 cents

1746
02:12:47,273 --> 02:12:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pass.

1747
02:12:48,093 --> 02:12:48,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1748
02:12:49,474 --> 02:12:49,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Ditto.

1749
02:12:50,714 --> 02:12:56,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, last but not least, Lego Batman 2 is going to be coming out at some point.

1750
02:12:57,376 --> 02:13:03,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other superheroes involved with it as well, not just Batman.

1751
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:13,362
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, there's a little teaser showing Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as some other characters.

1752
02:13:13,442 --> 02:13:13,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1753
02:13:14,562 --> 02:13:19,086
[SPEAKER_07]: and Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes will be the new title, I believe.

1754
02:13:19,106 --> 02:13:23,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of neat.

1755
02:13:23,309 --> 02:13:27,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, they're saying that they're expecting that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well.

1756
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:31,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks kind of neat.

1757
02:13:32,215 --> 02:13:34,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be hard to compete with Arkham City, though, even when you're Legos.

1758
02:13:34,857 --> 02:13:35,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I understand that.

1759
02:13:36,218 --> 02:13:37,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego games are pretty fun.

1760
02:13:37,579 --> 02:13:40,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Batman wasn't bad, so it'll be cool.

1761
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:46,695
[SPEAKER_08]: EverQuest 2 is now going free to play, but here's the weird thing, okay, EverQuest 2

1762
02:13:58,049 --> 02:13:58,990
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1763
02:14:13,888 --> 02:14:14,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Bless you.

1764
02:14:14,668 --> 02:14:15,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, rude.

1765
02:14:15,369 --> 02:14:16,329
[SPEAKER_08]: My body faked me out.

1766
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:17,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever had that happen?

1767
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:18,851
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I'm going to sneeze, I'm going to sneeze.

1768
02:14:19,031 --> 02:14:19,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Psych.

1769
02:14:19,791 --> 02:14:20,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1770
02:14:20,232 --> 02:14:20,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1771
02:14:20,912 --> 02:14:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, hang on.

1772
02:14:21,693 --> 02:14:23,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Great radio.

1773
02:14:23,994 --> 02:14:32,199
[SPEAKER_08]: EverQuest 2 Extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2, and there will be free, there will be silver, and there will be gold.

1774
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:34,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Free members get just a little bit.

1775
02:14:35,182 --> 02:14:41,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Silver members, which pay $5 or $500 station point things per month, they get a little more.

1776
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole $15 a month.

1777
02:14:44,874 --> 02:14:46,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, shit, you get everything.

1778
02:14:46,916 --> 02:14:48,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go, EverQuest 2.

1779
02:14:48,939 --> 02:14:49,680
[SPEAKER_08]: You can now check out.

1780
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if it'll get the same reception that...

1781
02:14:53,263 --> 02:15:12,089
[SPEAKER_08]: DC Universe did I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff in it EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1 so people didn't want to leave EverQuest 1 which is still going still going DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1782
02:15:13,436 --> 02:15:15,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have a little something for us.

1783
02:15:16,257 --> 02:15:19,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is something about a game that people have been waiting for.

1784
02:15:19,478 --> 02:15:22,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting for.

1785
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:25,600
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Kid Icarus.

1786
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,081
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's the 3D Classics Kid Icarus.

1787
02:15:28,621 --> 02:15:33,043
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be given away for free when...

1788
02:15:35,126 --> 02:15:37,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It launches on January 5th.

1789
02:15:39,468 --> 02:15:43,990
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to register two eligible 3DS titles online this Christmas.

1790
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:49,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of janky, but alright, whatever.

1791
02:15:49,192 --> 02:15:50,292
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Club Nintendo thing.

1792
02:15:50,932 --> 02:15:55,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So you get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes out next year.

1793
02:15:56,035 --> 02:15:59,456
[SPEAKER_11]: But where's the... People...

1794
02:16:01,104 --> 02:16:03,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally want a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama

1795
02:16:20,592 --> 02:16:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1796
02:16:22,073 --> 02:16:22,353
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1797
02:16:22,793 --> 02:16:25,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight.

1798
02:16:25,895 --> 02:16:27,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to actually open up the Skype line.

1799
02:16:27,976 --> 02:16:29,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It is open now.

1800
02:16:29,157 --> 02:16:33,860
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1801
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:35,501
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of a delay tonight.

1802
02:16:35,581 --> 02:16:41,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So before I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be a few more in a minute here.

1803
02:16:41,365 --> 02:16:41,645
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1804
02:16:42,065 --> 02:16:46,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you want to talk about, Loki, with last minute stories before we get to the Twitters?

1805
02:16:47,228 --> 02:16:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's talk about how the Vita will not support simultaneous web browsing and gameplay.

1806
02:16:53,892 --> 02:16:55,552
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only do one or the other at the time.

1807
02:16:56,793 --> 02:16:58,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that really that big of a deal, though?

1808
02:16:58,734 --> 02:16:59,555
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think so.

1809
02:16:59,595 --> 02:17:00,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so either.

1810
02:17:00,315 --> 02:17:05,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know a lot of people are making a big deal out of it, but I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like, what system now lets you do that?

1811
02:17:06,846 --> 02:17:09,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that, hello.

1812
02:17:10,369 --> 02:17:15,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so.

1813
02:17:16,035 --> 02:17:17,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1814
02:17:17,356 --> 02:17:24,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, of course, there's that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be discounted 40%.

1815
02:17:24,983 --> 02:17:30,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where that's... Apparently, it said a recent Vita event is where they announced that.

1816
02:17:32,049 --> 02:17:32,610
[SPEAKER_07]: In my pants.

1817
02:17:33,591 --> 02:17:33,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1818
02:17:34,992 --> 02:17:35,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

1819
02:17:36,613 --> 02:17:37,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1820
02:17:37,394 --> 02:17:40,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if they are, that's still too damn much for those.

1821
02:17:41,077 --> 02:17:41,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's great.

1822
02:17:42,118 --> 02:17:45,341
[SPEAKER_07]: That's promoting that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what?

1823
02:17:45,961 --> 02:17:47,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't do that anyways, because guess what?

1824
02:17:47,983 --> 02:17:51,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I get tired of my games after a while, and I want to sell them used.

1825
02:17:52,847 --> 02:17:53,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So, meh.

1826
02:17:54,878 --> 02:17:56,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I think is going to ultimately happen.

1827
02:17:56,279 --> 02:17:59,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the hackers are going to find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards.

1828
02:18:00,541 --> 02:18:01,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see that happening, absolutely.

1829
02:18:01,922 --> 02:18:05,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1830
02:18:20,529 --> 02:18:20,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

1831
02:18:23,012 --> 02:18:23,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I like fire.

1832
02:18:23,573 --> 02:18:24,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You do?

1833
02:18:37,210 --> 02:19:04,678
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name I'm so sorry but the guy was writing about how he got hacked and it's like kind of one of those things I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked to finally kind of put it out there where it's like wait a minute I didn't get phished and he even says this in the story like I don't think I got phished you know I'm not happy this is happening to people but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites

1834
02:19:05,698 --> 02:19:08,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic.

1835
02:19:08,159 --> 02:19:09,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Remind me to come back to this, okay?

1836
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:10,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1837
02:19:10,261 --> 02:19:10,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1838
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:13,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma Sautome.

1839
02:19:13,903 --> 02:19:14,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?

1840
02:19:15,603 --> 02:19:16,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

1841
02:19:16,384 --> 02:19:17,304
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of things.

1842
02:19:17,484 --> 02:19:21,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got home, so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds cookbook.

1843
02:19:22,787 --> 02:19:23,488
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't.

1844
02:19:23,548 --> 02:19:24,948
[SPEAKER_08]: The Angry Birds cookbook.

1845
02:19:24,968 --> 02:19:27,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Good God, could this game get any more saturated?

1846
02:19:30,471 --> 02:19:31,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cash cow, what can I tell you?

1847
02:19:31,992 --> 02:19:32,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right?

1848
02:19:33,033 --> 02:19:33,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1849
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is in the Angry Birds cookbook?

1850
02:19:35,761 --> 02:19:36,801
[SPEAKER_08]: What will I learn how to cook?

1851
02:19:36,881 --> 02:19:37,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Birds?

1852
02:19:38,422 --> 02:19:38,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I don't know.

1853
02:19:39,062 --> 02:19:43,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to read into it.

1854
02:19:46,426 --> 02:19:46,826
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

1855
02:19:46,906 --> 02:19:47,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1856
02:19:47,286 --> 02:19:48,226
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's phone went off.

1857
02:19:49,247 --> 02:19:54,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I just saw it online on a friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered.

1858
02:19:55,830 --> 02:20:00,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it talks about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.

1859
02:20:02,731 --> 02:20:04,452
[SPEAKER_08]: or pig themed recipes.

1860
02:20:05,413 --> 02:20:05,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?

1861
02:20:05,913 --> 02:20:07,394
[SPEAKER_06]: An Angry Birds cookbook?

1862
02:20:07,434 --> 02:20:07,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how?

1863
02:20:08,375 --> 02:20:08,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1864
02:20:08,715 --> 02:20:09,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

1865
02:20:11,017 --> 02:20:13,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade.

1866
02:20:13,519 --> 02:20:14,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's Loki's department.

1867
02:20:15,550 --> 02:20:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's all tiraded out tonight.

1868
02:20:17,011 --> 02:20:22,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you heard part A. No, I was at a premiere tonight.

1869
02:20:22,493 --> 02:20:23,033
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

1870
02:20:24,114 --> 02:20:28,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say that Xenoblade news just kind of one thing led to another on that department.

1871
02:20:31,036 --> 02:20:31,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1872
02:20:31,697 --> 02:20:34,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to listen to tonight's episode.

1873
02:20:34,418 --> 02:20:36,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and our website's coming back.

1874
02:20:36,159 --> 02:20:37,399
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the big news you missed too.

1875
02:20:38,099 --> 02:20:40,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back just depending on when DNS updates for people.

1876
02:20:40,961 --> 02:20:42,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully within 24 hours.

1877
02:20:42,701 --> 02:20:43,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

1878
02:20:43,282 --> 02:20:43,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1879
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:48,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.

1880
02:20:49,072 --> 02:20:49,972
[SPEAKER_06]: A game review?

1881
02:20:50,272 --> 02:20:50,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1882
02:20:51,032 --> 02:20:51,792
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to review?

1883
02:20:52,973 --> 02:20:58,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Voltron, Defender of the Universe for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1884
02:20:59,115 --> 02:21:00,436
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1885
02:21:00,536 --> 02:21:01,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't know?

1886
02:21:01,456 --> 02:21:01,816
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1887
02:21:02,356 --> 02:21:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it came out Wednesday.

1888
02:21:03,557 --> 02:21:04,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in school.

1889
02:21:04,297 --> 02:21:04,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no life.

1890
02:21:06,738 --> 02:21:08,818
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft.

1891
02:21:08,858 --> 02:21:13,020
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.

1892
02:21:14,557 --> 02:21:22,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Long and short of it, you are in control of any of the five lions and it's up to you to protect the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat Lotor.

1893
02:21:23,945 --> 02:21:25,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like a tower defense game?

1894
02:21:25,726 --> 02:21:26,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no.

1895
02:21:26,827 --> 02:21:30,631
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars.

1896
02:21:31,391 --> 02:21:32,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

1897
02:21:32,052 --> 02:21:32,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Geometry Wars.

1898
02:21:33,593 --> 02:21:36,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, take your typical treasure shooter.

1899
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that.

1900
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:46,854
[SPEAKER_06]: You're pretty much running around the plains just blasting everything that the lasers can see.

1901
02:21:47,994 --> 02:21:50,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up DarkSakura's alley.

1902
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:55,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cave shooter, or treasure shooter mixed with... Want.

1903
02:21:56,078 --> 02:21:56,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Want.

1904
02:21:56,458 --> 02:21:57,979
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go download the demo on Xbox.

1905
02:21:58,239 --> 02:21:58,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I will.

1906
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:01,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Ukchan, one more thing.

1907
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:02,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1908
02:22:02,941 --> 02:22:07,923
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like it, depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.

1909
02:22:09,499 --> 02:22:10,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, what a nice boy.

1910
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, okay.

1911
02:22:12,281 --> 02:22:13,922
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the best part about doing this show.

1912
02:22:13,982 --> 02:22:14,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play it.

1913
02:22:14,382 --> 02:22:15,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Once in a while, free shit.

1914
02:22:15,823 --> 02:22:16,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck yeah.

1915
02:22:17,424 --> 02:22:18,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1916
02:22:18,364 --> 02:22:19,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you, Ranma.

1917
02:22:19,765 --> 02:22:20,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Love you, mean it.

1918
02:22:20,966 --> 02:22:28,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So on a scale of one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?

1919
02:22:28,931 --> 02:22:29,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven.

1920
02:22:30,612 --> 02:22:31,532
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty good review.

1921
02:22:31,552 --> 02:22:32,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger?

1922
02:22:33,593 --> 02:22:34,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.

1923
02:22:34,594 --> 02:22:38,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?

1924
02:22:38,857 --> 02:22:39,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Your butt's for babies.

1925
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:43,564
[SPEAKER_06]: As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate.

1926
02:22:43,885 --> 02:22:48,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Ranma, do you know what I actually just watched all of last week?

1927
02:22:49,113 --> 02:22:49,333
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1928
02:22:49,914 --> 02:22:50,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Go Lion.

1929
02:22:52,138 --> 02:22:54,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all of it and I watched all of it.

1930
02:22:54,912 --> 02:22:58,615
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Row is called Hate is Gonna Hate.

1931
02:22:59,035 --> 02:22:59,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about that.

1932
02:22:59,676 --> 02:23:00,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw somebody get that on Twitter.

1933
02:23:01,277 --> 02:23:02,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ranma.

1934
02:23:05,401 --> 02:23:06,482
[SPEAKER_08]: This is such a great story.

1935
02:23:06,502 --> 02:23:07,502
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna hate it, but I don't care.

1936
02:23:07,863 --> 02:23:09,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I thought of you this week.

1937
02:23:10,045 --> 02:23:10,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1938
02:23:10,725 --> 02:23:12,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I was watching Wendy Williams.

1939
02:23:13,479 --> 02:23:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a man.

1940
02:23:14,179 --> 02:23:15,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want you to know.

1941
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:16,020
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a man.

1942
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:16,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1943
02:23:17,681 --> 02:23:19,881
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know I love Wendy Williams, okay?

1944
02:23:19,941 --> 02:23:20,802
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

1945
02:23:21,462 --> 02:23:24,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was talking about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something.

1946
02:23:24,823 --> 02:23:29,345
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of it, she said, and I kid you not, she said, stay black.

1947
02:23:30,245 --> 02:23:33,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?

1948
02:23:33,406 --> 02:23:34,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I thought that joke started here.

1949
02:23:34,847 --> 02:23:36,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

1950
02:23:37,228 --> 02:23:37,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, stop.

1951
02:23:37,908 --> 02:23:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1952
02:23:38,088 --> 02:23:40,389
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you like Wendy Williams?

1953
02:23:41,667 --> 02:23:42,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Haters gonna hate.

1954
02:23:43,768 --> 02:23:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 points from Gryffindor.

1955
02:23:47,709 --> 02:23:48,049
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1956
02:23:48,269 --> 02:23:55,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them.

1957
02:23:55,412 --> 02:23:57,572
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, somebody saying stay black.

1958
02:23:58,773 --> 02:24:00,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that all started with you here on the show, you know.

1959
02:24:00,913 --> 02:24:01,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't actually.

1960
02:24:02,194 --> 02:24:02,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

1961
02:24:04,017 --> 02:24:07,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Just related to... It's a phrase that's been out for a long time.

1962
02:24:08,018 --> 02:24:10,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know that, but I'm just saying.

1963
02:24:10,899 --> 02:24:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it in mainstream press this week and it made me think of our Ranma.

1964
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:15,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay black.

1965
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:18,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan didn't bring me any pie.

1966
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:19,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm mad at him.

1967
02:24:20,461 --> 02:24:22,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get more calls.

1968
02:24:22,701 --> 02:24:23,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back to Voltron.

1969
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:23,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun.

1970
02:24:24,642 --> 02:24:25,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, stay black.

1971
02:24:26,263 --> 02:24:27,103
[SPEAKER_06]: and you stay fabulous.

1972
02:24:27,264 --> 02:24:27,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

1973
02:24:27,604 --> 02:24:28,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I will, girl.

1974
02:24:28,804 --> 02:24:29,044
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1975
02:24:29,765 --> 02:24:31,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1976
02:24:31,966 --> 02:24:35,848
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1977
02:24:35,908 --> 02:24:37,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo in chat says stay black as an old saying.

1978
02:24:37,829 --> 02:24:38,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that.

1979
02:24:38,629 --> 02:24:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, I'm just being silly.

1980
02:24:42,071 --> 02:24:42,411
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1981
02:24:44,072 --> 02:24:48,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1982
02:24:49,714 --> 02:24:50,975
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some tweets in the meantime?

1983
02:24:54,685 --> 02:25:09,134
[SPEAKER_08]: OLRFanForever, hey I like that name, that's a great Twitter name, OLRFanForever, and it's like it's not my mom or something, like it's an actual person OLRFanForever asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester?

1984
02:25:09,795 --> 02:25:11,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Was DarkSakura eliminated?

1985
02:25:12,817 --> 02:25:18,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I believe DarkSakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention, correct?

1986
02:25:18,715 --> 02:25:20,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't bother promoting it.

1987
02:25:21,597 --> 02:25:28,022
[SPEAKER_08]: That night it was funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that?

1988
02:25:29,062 --> 02:25:32,805
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland.

1989
02:25:33,986 --> 02:25:37,248
[SPEAKER_11]: On the negative side, I would be whoring myself out to Sony.

1990
02:25:38,449 --> 02:25:39,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I am no one's whore.

1991
02:25:42,281 --> 02:25:49,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo

1992
02:26:01,676 --> 02:26:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely adorable.

1993
02:26:03,977 --> 02:26:05,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, look at her little hoodie on and stuff.

1994
02:26:05,477 --> 02:26:07,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's precious.

1995
02:26:07,198 --> 02:26:07,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

1996
02:26:07,738 --> 02:26:08,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sorry to derail.

1997
02:26:09,298 --> 02:26:11,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said.

1998
02:26:11,879 --> 02:26:12,699
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1999
02:26:13,779 --> 02:26:15,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Sally train's coming in today.

2000
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:17,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta have some discussions, people.

2001
02:26:18,361 --> 02:26:26,063
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, we need to talk about Evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers' issues with these game cards expiring.

2002
02:26:26,883 --> 02:26:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not...

2003
02:26:27,853 --> 02:26:31,674
[SPEAKER_04]: We really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their game cards expire.

2004
02:26:31,774 --> 02:26:33,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Evil G's fault.

2005
02:26:33,955 --> 02:26:38,756
[SPEAKER_04]: If I went to the grocery store to buy some milk and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer.

2006
02:26:39,036 --> 02:26:41,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd yell at the store that sold me the expired milk.

2007
02:26:41,737 --> 02:26:44,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I think EB Games should be taking these games off their shelves.

2008
02:26:44,578 --> 02:26:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be EA's fault.

2009
02:26:46,058 --> 02:26:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it.

2010
02:26:48,859 --> 02:26:51,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit, I didn't really think about it like that.

2011
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:52,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

2012
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:53,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of...

2013
02:26:54,494 --> 02:26:55,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I get what you're saying.

2014
02:26:55,615 --> 02:27:00,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I feel like they didn't really think about this before they implemented this.

2015
02:27:00,878 --> 02:27:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they informed the stores either that they have this problem.

2016
02:27:02,779 --> 02:27:04,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of think the stores don't know either.

2017
02:27:04,421 --> 02:27:05,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people just kind of didn't know.

2018
02:27:05,941 --> 02:27:07,983
[SPEAKER_04]: They told Evil G. You know what Evil G is.

2019
02:27:08,363 --> 02:27:09,984
[SPEAKER_04]: They would just pretend like they didn't know.

2020
02:27:10,444 --> 02:27:11,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell it to you anyway.

2021
02:27:11,425 --> 02:27:11,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2022
02:27:12,706 --> 02:27:13,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're all in cahoots?

2023
02:27:14,847 --> 02:27:15,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're in cahoots.

2024
02:27:15,808 --> 02:27:17,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Evil G is just doing it anyway.

2025
02:27:17,909 --> 02:27:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: EA probably told...

2026
02:27:19,789 --> 02:27:40,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Evil G, yo give us those games back if you don't sell them Evil G's like whatever we can sell anything I would honestly think though that Evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe like an independent ma and pa shop who you know only rarely gets a lot of people that come through there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time and

2027
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:58,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their shelf and I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't control that no one wants the goddamn game I don't know

2028
02:27:59,161 --> 02:28:01,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, either way, it ain't EBA's fault.

2029
02:28:01,382 --> 02:28:03,063
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are they supposed to keep these codes active for?

2030
02:28:03,463 --> 02:28:04,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a service.

2031
02:28:04,264 --> 02:28:05,824
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no monetary value to it.

2032
02:28:05,844 --> 02:28:06,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2033
02:28:06,164 --> 02:28:07,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a service.

2034
02:28:07,525 --> 02:28:08,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a gift card.

2035
02:28:09,106 --> 02:28:14,489
[SPEAKER_04]: A gift card is an account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency.

2036
02:28:14,889 --> 02:28:16,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize the gift card thing is a stretch.

2037
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a service being provided later.

2038
02:28:20,452 --> 02:28:29,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a little bit like you can't, it's not apples to apples comparison, but my point with that was that it's still, it would be $10 to replace that pass.

2039
02:28:30,503 --> 02:28:35,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly you're losing.

2040
02:28:36,169 --> 02:28:37,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not a gift card per se.

2041
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2042
02:28:41,502 --> 02:28:50,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year.

2043
02:28:50,806 --> 02:28:51,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the other thing too.

2044
02:28:51,566 --> 02:28:52,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at Blizzard games.

2045
02:28:52,587 --> 02:28:58,529
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're saying that, oh, by the way, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st.

2046
02:28:59,289 --> 02:29:00,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well then I'm going to buy used.

2047
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:04,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive to do so?

2048
02:29:04,691 --> 02:29:05,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the way to do it.

2049
02:29:06,826 --> 02:29:07,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's not a way to do it?

2050
02:29:08,127 --> 02:29:12,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't punish the publishers for doing this kind of bullshit?

2051
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:15,251
[SPEAKER_04]: How am I supposed to keep the stuff all open for?

2052
02:29:15,512 --> 02:29:17,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even think it's a punishment thing.

2053
02:29:17,273 --> 02:29:21,115
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just any shopper is going to find the best value they can.

2054
02:29:21,916 --> 02:29:22,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.

2055
02:29:24,057 --> 02:29:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you.

2056
02:29:25,118 --> 02:29:27,019
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up.

2057
02:29:27,717 --> 02:29:29,197
[SPEAKER_04]: to the dealership down the street.

2058
02:29:29,237 --> 02:29:31,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You shop around a little bit before you buy it.

2059
02:29:32,298 --> 02:29:35,119
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to educate yourself a little bit before you buy it.

2060
02:29:35,139 --> 02:29:36,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and play the game with people.

2061
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's got a different deal.

2062
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:45,721
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that.

2063
02:29:45,861 --> 02:29:54,403
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's nothing there, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game and someone hasn't played this copy of the game.

2064
02:29:55,163 --> 02:30:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new, I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap.

2065
02:30:02,811 --> 02:30:08,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Now going back to the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore?

2066
02:30:09,017 --> 02:30:12,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day.

2067
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:15,303
[SPEAKER_08]: EA has already made their money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf.

2068
02:30:15,343 --> 02:30:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't care at this point if the game is sold new or used because they already sold the game.

2069
02:30:18,666 --> 02:30:23,850
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably not buying new copies of that game anyway, so they probably have a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyway.

2070
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:31,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, say I want to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that.

2071
02:30:31,174 --> 02:30:39,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies that are used that are in good quality that you can get for $5, $10 cheaper or whatever.

2072
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people are like, okay, sure, I'll do that.

2073
02:30:42,942 --> 02:30:44,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that.

2074
02:30:44,924 --> 02:30:45,064
[SPEAKER_07]: But

2075
02:30:45,784 --> 02:30:55,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably guess that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run of Mass Effect 2.

2076
02:30:55,809 --> 02:31:02,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, well not a Game of the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.

2077
02:31:02,752 --> 02:31:05,753
[SPEAKER_07]: That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.

2078
02:31:07,403 --> 02:31:08,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

2079
02:31:08,504 --> 02:31:11,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really looked at it, but they may have.

2080
02:31:11,705 --> 02:31:11,945
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2081
02:31:12,266 --> 02:31:15,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Jim, Sally, I've got to wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets.

2082
02:31:15,607 --> 02:31:19,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter?

2083
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: South Park Games is going to be a great game.

2084
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:21,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Obsidian is doing it.

2085
02:31:21,651 --> 02:31:23,031
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the best developers ever in the world.

2086
02:31:23,092 --> 02:31:26,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Obsidian, thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 New Vegas.

2087
02:31:28,178 --> 02:31:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Knights of the Republic 2 I love you everybody and don't forget if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed you're picking it too much or not enough thank you for that sage advice Jim Sally appreciate it

2088
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:46,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I have high hopes for the South Park game too, I will say.

2089
02:31:47,062 --> 02:31:48,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope they don't let me down.

2090
02:31:48,743 --> 02:31:50,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the Twitters.

2091
02:31:50,383 --> 02:31:52,445
[SPEAKER_08]: 1877GameOLR, username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.

2092
02:31:52,465 --> 02:31:53,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We can probably squeeze in like one more call.

2093
02:31:54,806 --> 02:32:00,749
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuyo tweeted us and said, Hey, OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One.

2094
02:32:01,009 --> 02:32:02,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever loved a book this much.

2095
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:03,230
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2096
02:32:03,291 --> 02:32:04,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the Sixers.

2097
02:32:04,231 --> 02:32:05,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that's something from the book?

2098
02:32:05,633 --> 02:32:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

2099
02:32:21,208 --> 02:32:26,270
[SPEAKER_08]: saying the Day One Studios who developed Fear 3 and Mecha Salt, they laid off 95%.

2100
02:32:27,691 --> 02:32:32,713
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an entire development team because they lost a publishing deal with Konami.

2101
02:32:33,373 --> 02:32:36,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, they were working on a reboot of Silent Scope.

2102
02:32:37,855 --> 02:32:38,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2103
02:32:38,975 --> 02:32:44,117
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they pulled it.

2104
02:32:44,677 --> 02:32:45,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

2105
02:32:45,938 --> 02:32:48,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Silent Scope's kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go...

2106
02:32:50,251 --> 02:32:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe with all the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off.

2107
02:32:54,938 --> 02:32:55,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

2108
02:32:55,459 --> 02:32:56,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they didn't have to do it that way.

2109
02:32:56,721 --> 02:32:59,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now.

2110
02:32:59,505 --> 02:33:04,232
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Sniper Elite, and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior or something like that.

2111
02:33:04,753 --> 02:33:05,354
[SPEAKER_07]: That was...

2112
02:33:07,089 --> 02:33:36,729
[SPEAKER_07]: um actually pretty well liked and they have sequels coming out I mean there's not a lot of sniper games but I think something like Silent Scope would have stood out I would have guessed that they were working on was it that I remember the fuck the series is called now the one that was on the PSP and then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3 it was like a sci-fi shooter or something like that I don't even remember that's how wonderful that game was um but there was it was supposed to be like a launch title for the PS3 but I guess that would have been a little late

2113
02:33:37,069 --> 02:33:37,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let me go to the phones.

2114
02:33:38,010 --> 02:33:38,750
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got one more call.

2115
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:39,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2116
02:33:39,671 --> 02:33:39,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2117
02:33:41,553 --> 02:33:42,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Kokomo.

2118
02:33:43,054 --> 02:33:43,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a question.

2119
02:33:44,034 --> 02:33:49,298
[SPEAKER_05]: When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3?

2120
02:33:50,439 --> 02:33:52,040
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of Mass Effect.

2121
02:33:52,100 --> 02:34:01,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me, but here's the thing.

2122
02:34:01,267 --> 02:34:04,890
[SPEAKER_08]: What I really like about what they're doing with Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea.

2123
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:06,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess this is from that

2124
02:34:06,311 --> 02:34:30,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Demo that leaked out before and all that remember how they had the demo up early is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode that focuses more on the battle it's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end of the game you like more and the RPG mode to me sounds really really interesting because I do think Bioware can tell some good stories so but as far as like do I have enough time to freaking play Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably not

2125
02:34:31,971 --> 02:34:54,885
[SPEAKER_08]: but if Mass Effect 2 or if they do with 3 what they do with 2 didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect 1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game sort of yeah on the PS3 they did so maybe there'll be something like that so at least the rest of us can get caught up what's your opinion on it are you a Mass Effect fan

2126
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:58,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do enjoy Mass Effect.

2127
02:34:58,101 --> 02:35:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to have to take a whole week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3.

2128
02:35:04,345 --> 02:35:08,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have all the different things.

2129
02:35:08,388 --> 02:35:11,169
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be evil, and that's another play around.

2130
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:13,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so much time.

2131
02:35:14,537 --> 02:35:15,298
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2132
02:35:33,653 --> 02:35:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: based on how he was playing the story.

2133
02:35:35,213 --> 02:35:50,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is one thing that Bioware is really good at, and it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about the Old Republic, because love or hate Star Wars, they're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect-style storytelling in Dragon Age into an MMO, and for some people, that's very, very exciting.

2134
02:35:52,178 --> 02:35:52,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

2135
02:35:53,638 --> 02:35:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's all my questions.

2136
02:35:54,838 --> 02:35:55,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have a great night.

2137
02:35:56,018 --> 02:35:57,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, all right.

2138
02:35:57,379 --> 02:35:58,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your station.

2139
02:35:58,502 --> 02:35:58,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't, bye

2140
02:36:22,065 --> 02:36:35,775
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here, and that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to Astoria1up.com.

2141
02:36:37,736 --> 02:37:04,465
[SPEAKER_08]: where apparently the Digital Millennium Copyright Act the DMCA a few exemptions were granted about a year ago which had to do with the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use now the EFF is saying shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well if you want to mod your video game consoles what do you think I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if you can jailbreak your phone why can't you jailbreak your video game console

2142
02:37:05,307 --> 02:37:08,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, is it really illegal to do that right now?

2143
02:37:30,669 --> 02:37:34,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, technically, I mean, sort of it is.

2144
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:35,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but they're just not going to come after the user.

2145
02:37:36,431 --> 02:37:49,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially now that, you know, they have, in fact, ironically enough, I'm looking at something right now about reset glitch hacking on, well, you can do it on any Xbox 360 regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now.

2146
02:37:49,915 --> 02:37:52,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And looking at, you know, slim modding and stuff like that.

2147
02:37:52,996 --> 02:37:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Just curious to see what's required for that stuff.

2148
02:37:57,238 --> 02:37:57,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2149
02:37:58,474 --> 02:38:02,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem.

2150
02:38:02,937 --> 02:38:10,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that they don't want you playing pirated games on it for one and using exploits and all that stuff as well.

2151
02:38:10,981 --> 02:38:15,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why usually these companies will kick you off the network, which they can do because it's their network.

2152
02:38:16,104 --> 02:38:16,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2153
02:38:16,725 --> 02:38:21,187
[SPEAKER_08]: But for instance, didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation 3s because they were supercomputers?

2154
02:38:21,467 --> 02:38:21,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

2155
02:38:21,888 --> 02:38:22,348
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably...

2156
02:38:23,088 --> 02:38:25,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Never upgraded them, or who knows?

2157
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:29,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they even found a workaround so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.

2158
02:38:29,913 --> 02:38:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that illegal?

2159
02:38:31,133 --> 02:38:33,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation Network.

2160
02:38:33,415 --> 02:38:36,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter.

2161
02:38:39,235 --> 02:38:39,535
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2162
02:38:40,455 --> 02:38:43,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight, and that's also going to do it for the Skype line.

2163
02:38:44,017 --> 02:38:52,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Big apologies to those who didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+.

2164
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:56,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take your comments there, too, and we can read some of those on the show.

2165
02:38:56,141 --> 02:38:57,762
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, that's it.

2166
02:38:57,842 --> 02:38:58,522
[SPEAKER_08]: We're wrapping up.

2167
02:38:58,542 --> 02:38:59,202
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting out of here.

2168
02:38:59,242 --> 02:39:00,843
[SPEAKER_08]: You were done with last-minute stories, right, Loki?

2169
02:39:01,223 --> 02:39:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2170
02:39:01,823 --> 02:39:02,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2171
02:39:02,703 --> 02:39:03,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have anything.

2172
02:39:04,628 --> 02:39:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I figured, because you would have spoke up if you did.

2173
02:39:08,049 --> 02:39:08,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

2174
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:12,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio.

2175
02:39:12,891 --> 02:39:17,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost 9 o'clock or midnight on the East Coast, so I think it's about time to wrap up.

2176
02:39:18,032 --> 02:39:20,373
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show.

2177

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for downloading and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2178
02:39:23,254 --> 02:39:28,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been kind of a poopy past couple weeks with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us.

2179
02:39:29,336 --> 02:39:31,737
[SPEAKER_08]: and those of you that are listening live or still showing up and listening live.

2180

[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of people in chat tonight.

2181
02:39:32,917 --> 02:39:33,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys so much.

2182
02:39:33,757 --> 02:39:37,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And podcasties, you've stuck by us and here you are downloading another show.

2183
02:39:37,258 --> 02:39:38,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really appreciate it.

2184
02:39:38,759 --> 02:39:39,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the support.

2185
02:39:40,379 --> 02:39:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, if you like Orange Launch Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money.

2186
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:46,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.

2187
02:39:46,961 --> 02:39:47,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2188
02:39:47,822 --> 02:39:48,702
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be an exception.

2189
02:39:49,322 --> 02:40:05,256
[SPEAKER_08]: uh but you know here on this program we don't ask for your money all we ask help spread the word tell somebody about the program and uh you know help the OL Army grow so on that note let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can get out of here tonight Loki I'll start with you your final thought tonight

2190
02:40:05,812 --> 02:40:09,155
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I'm picking a really weird song for Cage Match.

2191
02:40:09,575 --> 02:40:09,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2192
02:40:11,377 --> 02:40:21,444
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is now that Loki's Lamey Borrows Saints Row the Third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the character that Travis Donovan made?

2193
02:40:21,464 --> 02:40:25,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Online pass is only for playing co-op or system link.

2194
02:40:25,627 --> 02:40:26,288
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2195
02:40:26,488 --> 02:40:27,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to figure out how to do that.

2196
02:40:27,929 --> 02:40:31,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Travis Donovan's little character of me.

2197
02:40:31,331 --> 02:40:34,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to create a profile on the Saints Row website.

2198
02:40:35,033 --> 02:40:47,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you do that, you go browse to his character and you add it as a bookmark or something like that and you go into your game and you log in with your account from the Saints Row website and then you can download it.

2199
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that.

2200
02:40:48,741 --> 02:40:48,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2201
02:40:49,181 --> 02:40:49,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2202
02:40:50,662 --> 02:40:52,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and DarkSakura, your final thought.

2203
02:40:52,708 --> 02:40:53,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2204
02:41:14,683 --> 02:41:14,924
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
