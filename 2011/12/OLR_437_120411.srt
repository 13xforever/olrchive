49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Weh.

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Weh.

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Weh.

52
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,880
has been down due to some stuff and things. We'll leave it at that. And out of our control.

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes. Namely, and I want to give

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,640
a shout out to, Jason and Dekeman, behind the scenes, have ensured that it will be back

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,280
up. Now here's the thing. I could flip the switch right now and some people would see

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
it, but it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out. The way DNS works out,

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,480
it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours. But exactly. So that

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,240
also keep, you know, keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.

60
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,920
Stop. All right. But, uh, anyhow, the, and, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,240
We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site, so everybody will get the

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,600
show and we'll have a website again. Yay. You better watch out though. If they catch

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,400
you, um, pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
for no reason. Why are we talking about this? I'm trying to be happy about the show. Coming

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,940
back for the show. Yay. Ah, party. All right. Anyhow, orange launch radio.com by the time

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,460
the podcast, the people download this in here, it's probably back up and running live listeners.

67
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,240
You're finding out about two minutes after I did. I said, I said you all would be the

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,800
first to know. So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, cause right

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,760
now try to do a show. Why are you showing me up your sleeve? I'm, I'm looking at my

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,320
fake watch. Even though we are not televised, I'm still going through the motions and looking

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,440
at my fake watch. Anyhow. Um, what else was I going to say? Damn you woman, you threw

72
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,240
me off. Um, chat.orangelaungeradio.com. It does work. It's up right now. Even on the

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,520
backup site for the folks listening live, we do encourage you to join our chat room

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,500
at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want,

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,120
such as, uh, Jim Sally in our chat room says 24 hour pirate special at olr.com. You can

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,520
get lots of booty at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. Um, yes. What? You get that look

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,740
on your face. Like I have something smart assed. I'm going to say, yes, but it doesn't

78
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,360
fit into the conversation that we're having right now. I'll save it. Does it ever fit

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,640
into the conversation we're having right now? It's unfortunately a week too late. So a week

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,280
too late. Yes, it is a week too late. All right, now I have to know what's your week

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:13,400
old joke. Say it. Well, the Xbox luba has a slick interface. No, that's still funny.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,320
Xbox lube jokes are still funny. It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't

83
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,560
been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website, but there will be

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,520
anyhow. All right, look, I want to talk about other exciting things. Not only is our website

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,160
coming back up, but um, there's an awesome charity event. We've pimped this on the show

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,120
for years. There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday in San

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,880
Francisco. So if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, you need to go to this event because

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,360
I'm going to be there. Dark soccer is going to be there. Loki, not going to be there,

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,520
but he'll be thinking about it. I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,940
of it. I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim. The moment I said that

91
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,140
Shermie looked up at me like the hell you will. But here's the thing, dark soccer and

92
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,320
I are going to San Francisco and um, salacious doesn't call. We don't honestly just pop anymore,

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,500
but Alan is going to be very honest, you know, had, you know, had I not been locked into

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,880
the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have been one that, uh, the

95
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,900
be on the stage thing, you know? Oh yeah, I know. Be true to the rock band cause I like

96
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,060
winning eBay auctions. So you know, well let me, let me back up for those that don't know

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,500
what Loom loud is cause I know we've talked about this for years on the show. We're very

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,840
grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like some people in chat room mentioning

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,000
early. I've been listening for five years. I've been listening since it was single digits

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,020
in the show. Um, we've been pivoting this for a long time. It's a great charity event.

101
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,520
It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA lounge, which is an actual venue and

102
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,240
there's, there's a lot of famous stuff that happens to DNA lounge. Um, club booty is one

103
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,840
of the biggest examples of that. That's the mashup club night where they actually like

104
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,720
mash songs together and some of those huge mashups song things that you hear out there

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,200
have come out of that club. By the way, on Thursday before Loom load, uh, club booty

106
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
is going to be spinning for an hour. So that's kind of cool. So that's, that'll be a part

107
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,200
of it. Um, but anyhow, what happens to Loom loud is people pay money, they get on stage,

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,100
they play rock band in front of a crowd full of nerds and people have like minded mindset.

109
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,980
So everybody gets into it. Everybody's drinking, everybody's having a great time and it's all

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,060
for a great cause. They collect money at the door. It's 10 bucks to get in. Um, and that

111
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,340
money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event, which is really worth it alone,

112
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,440
but you get to pick a prize off the swag table. And I'm not allowed to say what I know about

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,520
the swag table this year, but there's like really good stuff that people are going to

114
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,440
walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event.

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,520
And they're going to be doing a raffle. They're going to be doing these silent auctions. I

116
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction. I don't know what I can and

117
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,080
can't say, so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty, but

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,760
I will say, but I will say this, this, the silent auction stuff is amazing too. Like

119
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,520
one of the items in particular. Oh my God. Oh my God. Anybody that like grew up on an

120
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,640
NES is going to lose their shit over this. It's amazing. So, and I, I can't remember

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
if that's one of the eBay ones or not, because yes, you're going to be able to participate

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,000
online as well. And you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and, and, and the so-called

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
you're going to get to watch it online. It's all streaming at umlaut.org. And why am I

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,200
pimping this so bad? I'd be pimping it anyway, but I'm especially pimping it because there's

125
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,400
a live pre-show for the first time ever. That's going to be happening video from it. And they

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,080
asked me to co-host. So I'm going to be doing it with, um, uh, some other friends in the

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,760
gaming community, including carnage, who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff, uh, which

128
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,440
would be very cool. Some other folks from other websites are involved too. So it's no

129
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,680
like singular website doing it. This is not an OLR show. It's just, we're helping. We're

130
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
one of the cooks in the kitchen with this. So, and it's going to be great. Um, met a

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,360
lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place. And, um, yeah, it's, it's

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,120
going to be a kick ass show. So make plans to be here Thursday, six 30 Pacific nine 30

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,800
Eastern. Um, loud. That's U M L O U D.org. Now you have no excuse not to be there. It's

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,860
going to be delivered to your house. I'm also selling autographs on people's foreheads for

135
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,560
10 bucks. Don't spend dollar donations. Why not put it in the donation box? I'll sign

136
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,480
your forehead. You know what? If you're, if you will donate $20 to the cause, I'll make

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,880
out with you. No, I'm just kidding. Video camera. Only if you're hot. No, I'm just,

138
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But we will, I, we are going to lend our full support and

139
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,520
if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what? We'll have

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
a drink together. I can say at least that much. Yeah. We're not really going to make

141
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,000
out with you. No. Okay. And dark soccer will not show you her boots. No, but, but I am,

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,080
um, the designer this year. Um, I will not say much more than that, but you get to see

143
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:56,440
my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall and other things. Good stuff. So yeah.

144
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,240
And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little

145
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,240
creepy because I don't do video. Like I've done, you can see my work on that too. I've

146
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,640
done, uh, audio stuff since 97. So this is one of the first, I mean, besides back when

147
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,000
we were doing the Justin TV, like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show, which I

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,280
don't think makes her exciting video, but some people miss it. Maybe it'll come back

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,920
someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it. Um, but uh, yeah, I, I, I'm excited.

150
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm into it. I'm, I'm, I'm happy. You look perky. Yeah. It's been, it's been a busy week

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,200
and I've just had that coffee right over there. That coffee right over there that no one can

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
see, but us and websites coming back. I don't know if you heard, but it's very exciting.

153
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I was going to get some red bull before the show, but I have a Pepsi and as of at night,

154
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,960
my night couldn't get any better. Look at this. Look at this. My buddy, my pal Loki

155
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,080
tech master Loki brought me saints row the third on Xbox three 60 granted to borrow,

156
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,000
not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months. So

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,840
you completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister from the dollar

158
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:13,780
store. I got Robin snow globe. It was the thought that counts. I waited in line twice

159
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,080
as long as I spent shopping. All right. I hate the dollar store this time of year. All

160
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,160
right. Uh, going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge, radio.com salacious pop

161
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,780
in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler. At least he's a little

162
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:40,000
balder than me, which isn't saying much. Anyhow. All right. Uh, look, it's not, it's not about

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
that. It's about getting you guys to show up. They, they know this is the thing. They

164
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,920
know that the OLR and that the all games people are rabid people and they will wear when we

165
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,780
will do this stuff, they're, they're more likely to show up. So you guys have to represent

166
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,960
not just OLR, but all games and show up and cheer loudly and be excited about them loud.

167
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,800
And most of all, please donate. I know, I know it's a tough time of year, but, uh, keep

168
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,760
in mind the charity. There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher and we're

169
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,640
going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity. So again,

170
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,920
um, loud.org on Thursday. Alrighty. How about video games? Let's get back into how our gaming

171
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
weeks were and all that good stuff. We always like to kick off the show a little bit. How

172
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,320
was your gaming week? Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? I played stuff that wasn't

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,680
well. That made me played well too. But last night started the family tradition. We broke

174
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,760
out the Saturn and played Christmas nights. Oh, it must be the holidays. And then we realized

175
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,200
that our battery wasn't working so we couldn't save anything. But Dan decided that he was

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,500
going to play Ray Earth anyway, so he started playing Ray Earth. I finally played my copy

177
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,720
of P.O.P.O. 2 on the Sega Saturn. And you know what? That game sucks. Not that it sucks

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,180
that it's a bad game because P.O.P.O. is awesome. It kicked my ass. I am that out of practice

179
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,440
on P.O.P.O. And we played through, um, Parodius Da. We played through, um, G.K.O. Parodius.

180
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Um, sorry. Sorry. Gokugio Parodius. Um, we played through, um, a little bit of, uh, Oceberry

181
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,320
Parodius. A lot of Parodius. Um, Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized

182
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,560
that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn. Um, and then he beat, uh, Thunder

183
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,760
Force 3 on Saturn. Like, just sat down and played. There's apparently something called

184
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,560
kids mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields. So he

185
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,700
was just doing stress relief mode pretty much. Um, we played, I played actually, um, some

186
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,240
of the Blue Seed RPG until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG

187
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,880
because I read, like, a retarded five-year-old in Japanese. You had quite the Sega-filled

188
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,040
retro week. There's more. Oh my. I found my Utena game. I didn't play it. Was that the

189
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,000
Dish game? No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura. I can never remember

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
these things. But there was Clamp involved because it played Rayearth. And, um, I was

191
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,040
gonna play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or

192
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,560
anything, so. And, um, also, um, I bought Dan's present. Don't tell him anybody. It's

193
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,520
b-b-b-b-b-b. That's what Dan got. I'm not gonna repeat that. No, I'm not gonna tell

194
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,840
anybody what I got, Dan, because they'll tell him because of freaking internet. People can't

195
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:44,200
keep a secret. What's up with that? Um, and then, um, I bathed the cat. That's a game

196
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,840
all in itself. Uh, that's just, see what offended faces Shermie can make at you. She's asleep

197
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,160
in her bed now, but she doesn't- She does look cleaner. She's a lot cleaner. She doesn't

198
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
smell like her ass anymore. That's a good thing when she's right underneath me. She

199
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,980
doesn't smell like Old Lady anymore. Alright. I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like Cat Old

200
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,760
Lady. Uh, comments from chat.orangelandtrady.com. ActDeft in our chat room says, it's officially

201
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,440
the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights. That is true.

202
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,520
Uh, let's see. Misty says, woo, kid mode. Sounds good for me. Right? Preach it. I also

203
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,200
have to say, I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,700
last night, that Dan was, um, the, the little night song was playing and I remembered the

205
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,080
whole thing. I was singing along with it. The other thing I remembered the whole thing

206
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,040
of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese. You know why

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,320
that is? What? Because you're a nerd. So, I love this song. It's a cute song. Alright.

208
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,840
Loki, how was your gaming week? Did you play any, uh, old school Sega? I too broke out

209
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,920
the Sega, uh, Saturn to, uh, to play Hanukkah Nights. It's not quite as popular as Christmas

210
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,080
Nights, but, uh, but there's eight stages, eight stages since a little longer. Um, so

211
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:08,480
it was, it was pretty good. Um, no, actually I, I played, uh, lots of Skyrim and, uh, ran

212
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,200
across my, uh, fair share of glitches. Um, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity

213
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,760
on, uh, Facebook. This, uh, I fought a dragon and all of a sudden it froze for a second.

214
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,480
And then this giant, like, dirt thing was in front of me. I mean, we'll have to post

215
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,880
it to the, uh, Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing

216
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,760
down here. Just to give you an idea how tall this thing is. It's just ridiculous. It's

217
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,760
like an old faithful made out of dirt. Yeah, pretty much. And, and it is completely non-solid.

218
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,360
You can just run right through it. Cause it's like, ooh, big mountain that it created. And,

219
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,520
uh, it's weird. That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, um, today I was playing,

220
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,040
all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like,

221
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,880
wait, this is that same dragon I just killed like hours ago, days ago. It just fell from

222
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,520
the sky again. Uh, it's so glitchy. I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple of weeks just because

223
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,380
of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but, um, I really need to play

224
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,840
it more. God fucking chat. What, what did Chad do now? They're making assumptions. So

225
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,640
I just said it. You're dirty. So, um, yeah, I mean, I've been, and I haven't really been

226
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,120
doing anything. I actually had to force myself to go to the next like actual quest or the

227
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,640
storyline quest. And, um, but along the way, of course, I had to like waste a bunch of

228
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,320
time and went back to Helgen and picked up everything that wasn't attached to the ground

229
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,840
and stored it into a, you know, a night table. Apparently those night tables have, uh, some

230
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,400
sort of magical properties that you can store just everything in them. Like, you know, eight,

231
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,520
you know, great swords. Yeah, sure. Why not? You know, armor, tons of it. Comment from

232
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,320
Kaijuto in our chat room. Is he playing Skyrim on 360? I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.

233
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,800
I got a dragon flying backwards today. That's about it. Uh, yeah, 360. I was playing on

234
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,000
PS3. I didn't notice any bugs really. I'm playing, um, still on the last patch, the

235
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,960
one one because I'm not dumb enough to download one two. I'm just like, nope, I'm not going

236
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,840
to download that. I, I like having magical resistance and stuff like that and my dragons

237
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:35,360
flying forward. Um, so I've been playing, um, that and then actually I'm setting up

238
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,760
my J tag to play once I'm done, how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything.

239
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,520
Go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can, uh, port over

240
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,360
the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a J tag, which is fantastic. And so you can

241
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,480
do a bunch of cool things with that. Um, of course I'm not doing that right now. I'm actually

242
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,180
just playing legitimately. Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations

243
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,040
where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their

244
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,120
belongings, which is never a good idea because I, I started selling some firewood back to

245
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,720
one of the ends or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel

246
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,840
were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place of everything that was not

247
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,000
steel. And so now they, you know, people eating, I'm taking your food, you know, and just all

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,160
sorts of fun stuff like that. Awesome. Um, Hey, you helped him out. What's theirs is

249
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,880
yours. Exactly. And then I sold it back to them, which is great. Um, you can do some

250
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,000
mean things in Skyrim. There's some like really funny stuff. Like I went to this one Fort

251
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
and all these bandits are running around. There's this old woman and she's like, I come

252
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
with the Fort and you know, there's people coming and going. I don't know who's taking

253
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,520
over one side wins, the other side comes back and blah, blah, blah. So meanwhile, all these

254
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,840
bandits are attacking it and I'm attacking them. And she's like, I think you should leave.

255
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,880
And it was hilarious. I'm like, I'm going to kill you bitch. Keep like fucking talking

256
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,920
to me. And then she finally, she's still there, but you know, now the Imperial forces are

257
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,600
there. And this is hilarious because she's like, yeah, these people that have captured

258
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,840
her, she's just like, I think you should go like, well, no, I'm not going to. You know,

259
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,600
the thing Skyrim obviously is, is doing amazingly well, you know, and it's a single player game

260
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,960
and everything. And I noticed a lot of what makes single player games really transcend

261
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like

262
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,300
grand theft auto four or grand theft auto three, which while granted they do have their

263
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,520
multiplayer modes, they're probably more known for their single player. I think these games

264
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,400
that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,200
stuff that the people create in the environments. Part of the reason why you really love saints

266
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,360
row too is that, you know, it's, it's a very absurd sandbox. It's somebody pooped in the

267
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,080
sandbox and it's, it's still has its own microcosm. Yeah, I really do. I'm probably going to go

268
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,720
back to saying it's row again cause I was looking at Tim. I, I don't have all the achievements

269
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,200
yet. I'm almost there, but I just haven't, I really hated doing the, um, car theft missions

270
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,280
and so I didn't. And then I also have to replay the game as a, you know, a female character

271
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,760
for at least two hours and get that achievement. Um, and then I have to finish some of the

272
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,520
other story missions in a different way than I did before. But you know, it's almost at

273
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,680
the end. Uh, the other thing I played this week also was called duty, modern warfare

274
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,600
one, you know, call duty four. Uh, we went, now we're in sibling, just regular free for

275
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,360
all death matches. We're going old school free for all death matches, which is kind

276
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,320
of a little bit like grand theft auto death matches where you start off with the same

277
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,200
weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along. So it's kind of fun just

278
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,360
mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game. Uh, eventually the problem

279
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,000
is so it's like every time I'm like, can I go work on the mod game or I can play Skyrim

280
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,960
and usually Skyrim where it wins out, you know? Yeah, I know how it goes. That game

281
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,360
literally it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it. I collect shit. I hoard

282
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,760
it all. Your wife pretty much hates reading books. She doesn't care. The only thing I

283
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,040
heard out of her like yesterday was, Oh, that's pretty, you know, cause you know, it's the

284
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,080
environment and stuff. It is pretty, but like, you know, I, I attacked a mammoth the other

285
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,920
day and stuff. I killed a couple of bears today. Yeah, they're pissing me off. Did you

286
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,760
find the cave of bears? Yes, they did find the cave of bears. Yes. I don't know if it

287
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,440
was, it's right outside one of the quest towns. There's actually, it's a place, it's called

288
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,120
like the bear cave or something like that. It's nothing but bears. There was two bears

289
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,200
in a cave that I found. I don't think it was that. It was on my way to, I don't remember

290
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,600
the damn town names. It's been a while. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anything else for your week

291
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,560
you want to share? Uh, that's it. All right. Um, my gaming week, actually not quite as

292
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,240
exciting as my co-host this week. I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week. Um, uh,

293
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,440
I wanted to get Mario Kart seven today, but I neglected to order online and now that I'm

294
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,720
trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it till after Christmas. I'm

295
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,920
like, screw you. Um, I want it now. I was literally next door to an evil G today and

296
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,360
I still didn't want to go in. I'm like, I'll wait till I'll go to target later in the week.

297
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,080
So yeah. Uh, no Mario Kart seven for me today, but um, I will get it this week. Just things

298
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,960
are a little bit crazy right now. As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier,

299
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,240
prepping for Thursday and, and just everything else going on with my day job is nuts right

300
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,700
now. Um, there hasn't been a whole lot of time. I will tell you what little time there

301
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,140
has been. I honestly truly have been spending on world of Warcraft because with good reason,

302
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,100
a huge content patch hit this week. The dark moon fair. Yeah. The four, three patch hit

303
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,180
this week, not just dark moon fair that started the other night, but the five man instances.

304
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,180
There's a new raid and now they have this whole new looking for Ray tool. So if you're

305
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,820
not even in a guild that raids regularly like mine kind of raids like half the time, um,

306
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,260
you can do this whole thing where you can raid now. So it's, it's great. There's a lot

307
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,000
of stuff you can do there. So my time has been kind of sucked away into world of Warcraft

308
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,460
and I talk more about it on this week's Horde house. That's the other show I do. www.hordehouse.com

309
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,100
check it out. Just posted earlier today. Um, so yeah, uh, other than that, I bought some

310
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,620
other games this week. I just haven't played them yet. I bought another one of those bundles.

311
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,960
It's not the humble indie bundle cause it wasn't really for charity, but it was another

312
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,940
bundle and uh, you'll have to forgive me. I forgot the name. Somebody in chat, I'm sure

313
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,680
will yell it out, but it's the bundle that had Cthulhu saves the world. It's like a big

314
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,260
something. Yeah. And then it had, it had a really big world bundle maybe. Yeah. It had

315
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,100
a really neat sounding game in it, which between that and the Xbox live indie games that I'd

316
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:55,200
played before, I knew it would be worth it. Um, it was, um, like poker mixed with puzzle

317
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,340
game mixed with RPG. It sounded really cool. So I wanted to play that. I just didn't get

318
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,440
around to it this week because again, new wow patch, busy day life. So it'd be awesome

319
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,860
if it's swords and poker for the PC, but they didn't. It is not swords and poker PC. So

320
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,440
that was another game took over my life. Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't

321
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,840
even get the answer for them. So we'll see. It'll come up in a little while I'm sure.

322
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,240
So the problem with those indie bundles, it's like I'm not buying anymore until I play the

323
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,060
one that I have and I've only played one game out of it. You know, VVVV. Um, I still haven't

324
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,400
played all the other ones out of that Humble Any Bundle. Um, so yeah, it probably will

325
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,580
be a while before I buy any more of those. Actually it was looking a little bit on Xbox

326
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,620
indie games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet and I thought

327
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,240
about buying some stuff. I almost bought DLC quest, but then I was like, how often would

328
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,240
I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff? So it'll be something I purchase

329
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,760
later on. All right, thank you guys. Thank you chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

330
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,560
It was, uh, Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle.

331
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,880
It's done. That was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it. I don't

332
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,480
know, but it's done. So unfortunately you can't buy this now, but um, let's see. Unless

333
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,160
maybe you can. Now the current minimum is done. It says or beat the minimum. I don't

334
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,520
know what the minimum is. I don't know if you can still buy it, but again, you look

335
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,960
down here and it says one minute, five seconds ago they were still selling it. So I don't

336
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,960
think you can. Well, let me try for dollars. Go see if it'll work. But anyway, the, uh,

337
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,040
it had, um, breath of death. Cthulhu saves the world. The game I was trying to think

338
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,100
of rune spell overture. That's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out.

339
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,600
So there you go. And sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore. I think

340
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:57,780
it's done so can't get it now. All right. Um, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you want

341
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:04,800
to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.

342
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,840
Awesome. Some other things we want to plug. You're old, right? I was talking about this

343
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
earlier and you were like, no, you're not old. It's like, no, I'm forgetting things

344
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,760
left and right. All right. Um, couple other things we wanted to mention before we get

345
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,600
into tonight's news. I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet. Twitter.com

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,040
God there will be a mailbag again next week. Um, hopefully as well if we're getting the

353
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,840
old website back, so that should be up midweek or so. All right, let's get into some gaming

354
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,840
news. Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight. Yes. Um, so lots of stuff

355
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,840
coming out about the PlayStation Vita. And of course one of the things that people are

356
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,520
wondering is how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us? Of course it's

357
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,520
going to be something reasonable, right? Right. Right. No. Um, actually no, they're, they're

358
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,640
pretty, pretty, um, high priced. Uh, let's see here. Or as you might say, not reasonable.

359
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Yes. Not reasonable at all. Um, apparently they're saying that the according to GameStop

360
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,980
or the evil G if you will, uh, they have it listed on their website that the four gigabyte

361
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:50,520
card is going to be $29.99. Although they have, um, I guess Sony has told some websites

362
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,640
that the four gigabyte cards that actually retail for $24.99, uh, eight gigabyte cards

363
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,680
for $39.99. But, but I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell

364
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,120
stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it

365
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:14,120
listed for. Um, so beyond the four and eight gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will

366
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:23,640
run you $69.99 and 32 will be $119.99. Um, why is this important? Because they're required.

367
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,300
You need to have a memory card to play your games for the most part. Most games require

368
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,480
the memory card and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory

369
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,640
card in order to do that. And it's proprietary so you can't just, you know, get an SD card

370
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,480
or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper. But you know,

371
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,120
hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right? That's what their

372
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,720
fear is. Or they're going to hack the system somehow. I tell you this much, Sony, they're

373
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,480
going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have. It's

374
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,720
just going to happen. So I have to have a memory card and is Sony selling a bundle that

375
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,280
includes a memory card? They launched, they're going to have an launch bundles or whatever

376
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,040
that come with like a two gigabyte one I think. Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price

377
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,080
point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, Oh my God, I can't believe they're

378
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,540
releasing the Vita for 250. That is in fact a lie because 250 doesn't get you a memory

379
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,200
card. Am I correct? Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah. But some games do not require

380
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,560
it. Okay. Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves and they

381
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,400
also have storage for download content and stuff like that. Some other games require

382
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,040
memory cards for that storage as well. I was going to say, if these stupid things are required,

383
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,680
then the system's not really $250, is it? But because there is that little, you know,

384
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,560
we call that a new poll where it's like, okay, well really you can play some games without

385
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,560
one. Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360. Remember when they first released? You don't

386
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,840
have to get a hard drive, but you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever. But

387
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,960
they're a little ridiculous. And I mean, I understand the price of memory. I'm sorry,

388
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,960
that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards. Especially when everything else is

389
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,800
way cheaper. I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive

390
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:29,080
prices. I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120? I'm sorry, you can get a 250

391
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,520
gigabyte hard drive for probably about 30 bucks, if not cheaper than that. And it's

392
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,560
just such a high markup. And it's not anything really special either. It's just a laptop

393
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,840
hard drive formatted a special way, which you can get any laptop drive and format it

394
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,800
that special way if you have the right software to do that. Now, some of our folks in the

395
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,840
chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing. And so like

396
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,600
SSJ100 Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now about upwards from $350. And Alpha

397
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,920
Kinanagram is like, no, it's 250 plus 25. You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is

398
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,440
nice. Tiger Claw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video

399
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,740
player. And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD passport thing?

400
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,940
So if I let me get this right. If I want to play Luminous Old School all over again, assuming

401
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,320
it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is. I need to buy the right to

402
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,080
get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some

403
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,360
of these games on. Yes. Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game

404
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,560
would just cost me used anyway to just play on my old PSP. Yes. Logic doesn't apply and

405
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,860
when it comes to new video games, Rob, I know it's just, it's, it's so interesting to me

406
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:51,400
because what got everybody excited about the Vita? What truly got everybody like, fuck

407
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,040
yeah, Sony Vita. What got everybody really excited about it? The price, the back. It

408
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,160
was that price. No, it was not the back touch. It was not the reach around. It was that $250

409
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,320
price and now it's kind of like, oh, but it's, yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know,

410
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,880
oh, by the way, uh, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how

411
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,000
we were talking last week about Ridge Racer and there's, there's another thing to lose

412
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,320
a little excitement about the Vita over Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little

413
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:30,320
bit cheaper than your average average PlayStation game. It's $29.99 whereas your average going

414
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:40,960
costs for a Vita game is going to be $39.99. So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the

415
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,720
game. Fantastic. It's awesome. You know what? I'm going to save myself $30. I'm just not

416
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,920
going to buy that game. You know, I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am

417
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,840
a consumer whore and I want all the new toys, but I'm finding myself a little less excited

418
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,720
than I was a few months ago. I mean, at the end of the day, it's all about games. It is

419
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,660
all about the game. And if there is a truly like kick ass, oh my God, blow my mind game

420
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:14,520
on this thing. Like, you know, I got to say luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic.

421
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,600
There's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita, then you know, all this stuff seems

422
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,600
a little less worth waiting. Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that. You know,

423
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,480
being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything. It nets you a bunch of problems

424
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,080
and more expensive price point. That is it. What are you going to net? Oh, I get to play

425
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,280
some of these games early. Well, it's all generation one stuff. I mean, is there really

426
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,640
anything super fantastic? I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then a Uncharted

427
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,320
game might be worth it to you. I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan,

428
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,000
but I'm not buying Ridge Racer and I don't really care about a new, um, you know, Little

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,640
Big Planet game or ports of a bunch of older games, you know, like ultimate, you know,

430
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:09,840
Marvel versus Capcom three or, um, you know, UFC game, MMA stuff. Uh, I just don't care

431
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,880
that they're porting that stuff over right now. Our chat room is on fire. It is literally

432
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,420
burning with conversation on this whole thing. Uh, Alf Kananagram is talking about the bundle,

433
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,680
the PlayStation Vita first edition bundle, PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, four

434
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,440
gigabyte card and little deviance $349. God, I sound like a PR dude. I got to admit, not

435
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,400
all that stuff interests me. I'm, I'm probably going to want a card more than four gigabits

436
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,620
and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3g like I don't need it. I think they have

437
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,360
one that's without the 3g as well, but I'm not sure if that's available over here. I

438
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,840
think that's only in Canada. Go Canada. Tiger class says, what boggles me? Why only up to

439
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,400
32 gigabytes? We got memory sticks that go up to 64 gigabytes. I wish my phone had a

440
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,240
64 gig micro SD card. Then I could put all my music on it and use it as my primary music

441
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,800
player. Here's the problem though. If you're selling a memory stick or a memory card or

442
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,360
whatever you want to call it, that's the same price as the goddamn system. No one's going

443
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,440
to fucking there. Wait a second. I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised. All right,

444
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,640
one more comment. I'm going to get to hear from a private message. Usually I don't read

445
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,140
private messages cause I'm like talk in the main room, but I'll let me Klotov have this

446
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,440
one because he did guest on a whorehouse earlier today. So he did me a favor. But anyway, uh,

447
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,960
even though he only did a mediocre job, no, just kidding. Just kidding. I just want to

448
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,760
give him to all tab and say something angry. Uh, me. Klotov says rumor has it that the

449
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,160
memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus

450
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,440
retail box. Yeah, but here's the thing about that. That's all rumor and I don't know if

451
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,660
that's actually true or not. And on top of that, that all that is is just incentivize

452
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,600
you to buy the more expensive, you know, memory card because at the end of the day, you say

453
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,320
you buy like a four gig stick. What's that going to hold one or two games? I mean, that's

454
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,840
not going to offset the price of that memory card. All I have to say is the more and more

455
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,020
we talk about all this and oh, let, please let that 40% thing be true because once that

456
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:24,760
news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react.

457
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,600
The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen. Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy

458
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,960
GameStop included. Well, here's the thing is, well, how long is it until the Vita comes

459
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,320
out in Japan? I mean, isn't that like right around the corner? Yeah, it's like the 17th.

460
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,600
I thought the prices, the price points that they had for games on, I don't know if that's

461
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,760
just been announced yet, but I don't think it's going to be 40%. I think it's going to

462
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,520
be either the same price or just slightly under, not 40%. If it is 40% cool, you know,

463
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,480
then that way maybe it gets more people to buy this, you know, their games or whatever

464
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,400
or people just be more selective in what they buy. Alright, let's move on with another story.

465
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,360
This is also about Sony and this, I don't know what to think of this news and I think

466
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,920
a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either. There are

467
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,580
rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony. Ueda. Ueda, excuse me. He's quit Sony

468
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,560
and why is this important? Oh, he's the creative lead behind a Team Ico, which is creating

469
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,480
The Last Guardian. Remember The Last Guardian? Remember that? That was that game that showed

470
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,360
up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good

471
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,520
and then it was suddenly absent this year. And yeah, apparently he is left. The game

472
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,720
hasn't come out yet and it's like 2012 at this point. Maybe that explains why it was

473
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,440
supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not. Supposedly he is working on the

474
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,760
project still. He's freelancing. But yeah, interesting. Sony was asked to comment on

475
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:10,660
the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation. Right. Okay. Be interesting

476
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,320
to see how that impacts that game. I know, right? Especially if they announce it now

477
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,400
for the 360 and the Wii U. It's not. Maybe that's the surprise. It's not going to be

478
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,920
on the 360. It's on the Wii U! What about the Wii U, Loki? What about it? We haven't

479
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,760
seen anything that it actually does. Maybe that's the joke! If I take a big cardboard

480
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,440
box and write Wii U on it and then play a video next to it of all this amazing shit,

481
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,080
are people like, oh my god, I need to buy the Wii U! Look at all the shit it can do!

482
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,440
It doesn't do anything yet! It's just a video with some tech demos and shit. They don't

483
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,000
actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that

484
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,720
does something, but at E3 that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware. All I'm saying is that

485
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,720
if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you

486
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,360
Shadow of the Colossus and Aiko, comes the last guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just

487
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:20,720
be like, I don't give a fuck. This is what you're going to hear in the audience. It's

488
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,520
not going to go to any other platform other than Sony. I guarantee it. It's not going

489
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,320
to happen. He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit. It's

490
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,600
not fun to fantasize about. Who cares? I mean, yeah, people will be excited that it's coming

491
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,480
to another platform. He'll probably do something amazing later on. It'll be separate from all

492
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,440
this. Form his own game studio, and so on. Alright, let me reset Yackety Sax for the

493
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,320
next story, Dark Sakura. Xenoblade. Which, you know, they said, oh, no plans, no plans,

494
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:06,560
blah blah, it's getting released in the US. As a GameStop exclusive. Retail exclusive.

495
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:18,240
It's not just a GameStop. I know, but... Um, they said, Nintendo of America has said that

496
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:27,400
it's going to be out in April 2012. But I mean, why, why, why not have just already

497
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:36,200
put it out? It's in English. It's there. Why wait? Because, Dark Sakura, they have to

498
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:47,720
remove the Us and put the Zs back in. So what? So what? Okay, so... Excuse me, the Zeds.

499
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,280
And all the Zeds are now Zs. So Maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look

500
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,960
nonsensical. Americans won't understand it. So Yogurt has an H in it. Is there yogurt

501
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,760
in the Xenoblade Chronicles? I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.

502
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:15,480
There probably is yogurt. Just, you know what? Just for that, I'm still going to get the

503
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,640
British one. Look, I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this. No, I haven't

504
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,640
pre-ordered it. I haven't until April. Why, why pre-order it today? I am, I don't need

505
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,340
to pre-order this. Rob's got a little steam-plot over his head. I just, I do because I really

506
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,240
feel like, I feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to

507
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,880
fail? Yes. Have you ever heard that before? You're setting me up to fail. At work all

508
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,320
the time. I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying. It's a very, very thing

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,480
you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail. Yes, they do. We're not

510
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,920
a company that sets people up to fail. Yes, they do. Okay. I feel like this game is being

511
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:08,980
set up to fail. Yeah. And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic. I mean, for

512
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:16,240
a Wii game. It's, at the end of the day, a game is a game. And even though it's a really,

513
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,000
really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game, it's still a really good RPG that any

514
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
RPG fan needs to experience. For real. I mean, for real. I mean, so what if it doesn't have

515
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff? We pimp classic games here on the show all

516
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,880
the time. It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games

517
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,320
in the slightest because this game does a lot. And like seriously, when you do play

518
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,460
it, you're like, this is a Wii game? Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.

519
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:51,120
And they should! But the problem is, I think we're, like, A, this game is coming out now.

520
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,640
It's like, the joke's over. And everybody's left the building. Like, like, a Loki said

521
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,760
earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox lube joke because it was a week old. Well, this

522
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,260
game is coming out, like, years after it came out in Japan at this point, right? It's gotta

523
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,040
be at least a year since it's out in Japan. At least six months from Europe, for sure.

524
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,240
And for what reason, we don't know. After everyone who already really wanted it has

525
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,200
pirated it at it. Pirated it at it. Let me put it this way. If you're translating from

526
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,440
English to English, English English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week

527
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,280
to finish that. I mean... It's called, um, Find and Replace. Yeah. I mean, I don't see

528
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,800
how that would be that difficult to go through there. And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the

529
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,120
words that's spelled in English English. Who cares? People are gonna be able to read it.

530
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,580
And you know what? Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was

531
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,780
misspelled in the first place. Or it's spelled correctly but just not in the way that we

532
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:56,400
may spell it correctly. Who gives a shit? You can understand it. So, so for one, it's

533
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,920
coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it. So

534
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,720
now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's gonna be honest about it and actually buy

535
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,640
the game if they pirated it. Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that

536
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,640
imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever. At least

537
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,720
they haven't said. I, I can't believe I came on this show and said, Nintendo's, they're

538
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,120
not gonna wait this long and then just re-release the same game. You'll get like Xenoblade Chronicles

539
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,360
Master Edition or International Edition. I'll have some extra stuff. Oops. Boy, did I give

540
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,760
somebody too much credit. Come on, Rob. I mean, this, this is a company that innovates

541
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,000
in every turn possible. I mean, they wouldn't, this isn't a company that would, I don't know,

542
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,480
take a Super NES ROM and put it on a CD and call it an anniversary edition or something

543
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,960
like that and sell it for $30 instead of putting it on the Virtual Console. No, they would

544
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,880
never do that. Ever. I mean, this isn't a company that tries to cash in. I really wanna

545
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,440
look at this translation. You know, you know what I mean. I bet it comes out and all that

546
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,880
shit is still in there. I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all. Yeah. So, what

547
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,720
do you wanna bet? We'll see, we'll see. But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release

548
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,800
thing. What does this tell you? If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only

549
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,080
get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really gonna do a lot of marketing behind

550
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,820
this. You're not gonna see Xenoblade TV commercials. You're not gonna see magazine ads really a

551
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,960
whole lot. Maybe onesie twosie here and there. GameStop might promote it a little bit. GameInformer

552
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,480
will probably have an ad for it. Oh, that's true. GameInformer will probably have it.

553
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,440
And they are a big magazine. But it's not gonna be quite that campaign you would see

554
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,160
behind old, say, Mario Kart 3DS or, you know, some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going

555
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,840
on right now. Which, it just seems like they're just gonna, ugh, hear. Well, it's all about,

556
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:46,960
you know, exposing themselves to loss. And they stay, I mean, history has shown with

557
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,400
games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's

558
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,120
not gonna sell very well. I mean, look at Mad World, look at, you know, even some of

559
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:00,480
the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff. It just, it, it

560
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,600
looks good. It could be really cutting edge as far as, you know, the technology behind

561
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,840
it or something like that. Or it can be really edgy, it's like a violent game and stuff.

562
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,800
But people, and hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell. And unfortunately, you know,

563
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:20,640
for Nintendo to publish this, and, you know, to bring it over here, I mean that, it's a

564
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,140
risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing, or, well, they're

565
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,400
not doing any marketing, but spend some money on, you know, another Mario Kart game or another

566
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,680
Mario game that they know they're gonna sell millions of copies of. But, at the same time,

567
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,840
you know, cause they kinda, they wanna not lose all their cred with, you know, hardcore

568
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,560
gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer. I mean, at least

569
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,560
that's what they're trying to, you know, this is how they're skewing it right now with saying,

570
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,840
look, Ninja Gaiden, or Ninja Gaiden's gonna be on. Look, hey, there's a Ghost Recon game

571
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,600
that's gonna be on. Hey, look, it's gonna have, you know, all these publishers backing

572
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,120
it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want, you know, the hardcore gamers to come

573
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:07,240
back. But, I think this game would have been better off having, like, an Atlus or an Ignition

574
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,860
or Exceed or something like that bring, this is a perfect game for something like Exceed

575
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,960
to bring over because this is the type of games they bring up. They bring over niche

576
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
RPGs.

577
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,680
Yeah, problem. Problem. It was developed by a Nintendo second party. So, can't happen.

578
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
All this makes me miss working designs.

579
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,120
Sure it can. It can, it can definitely happen. If they don't wanna publish it over here,

580
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,360
they can sell the rights to somebody else to publish it.

581
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
True.

582
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,360
But, here's what I think happened, and the reason why it's a GameStop exclusive, because

583
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,560
they backed money to bring it over here.

584
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,400
Yeah, that's what our chat's saying too. GameGuru in our chatroom says, GameStop probably paid

585
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,360
for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive. I just, I don't

586
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,600
know. I just, I worry at the end of the day it's not gonna sell as much as it should,

587
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,720
and then Nintendo's gonna say, well, this is why you can't have nice things. We were

588
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,880
gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall, and it didn't sell, so no last story

589
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,160
for you. Goodbye.

590
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,080
Here's why I say that. Fuck em. Because, you know what? I don't need them to bring out

591
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,720
fucking RPGs. They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want. Because, guess what?

592
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,720
This world has multiple publishers. It's just full of publishers that bring out RPGs, like

593
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,520
Atlas, or Exceed, or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs. And guess what? I don't

594
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,680
need you to fucking bring over anything. You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports game

595
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,280
games, your stupid, if there's another goddamn game with WooHoo Island in it, I don't give

596
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,800
a fuck if WooHoo Island is in there. It's not a landmark, it's not something like, oh

597
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,080
my god, this island's in here, it's such a character, as they put it. I don't fucking

598
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,480
care. Hey, why don't you put WooHoo Island in fucking, you know, Xenoblade or whatever,

599
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,800
because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are gonna want to see that. And hell, Mario's

600
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,240
a playable character, since, you know, it's a Nintendo published game, it's gotta have

601
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,720
fucking Mario in it.

602
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
Mamma mia.

603
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,560
So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't bring it out of here. And if they're

604
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,640
like, we listen to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through, well, fuck you, you

605
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,520
know what, because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit,

606
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,480
and sure, people are gonna cream themselves over goddamn Zelda, and to be fair-

607
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Well, I was gonna say, hold on, hold on, because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward

608
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,280
Sword? Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing, I haven't played it myself. But that

609
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,920
Mario 3DS game, I will tell you first hand, is that good.

610
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,880
Okay? To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy. It's not a

611
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,840
Xenoblade. It's a different type of game. It's an adventure game, if you will. It's

612
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,080
not an RPG. It's an adventure game. It's a different type of game altogether. See, this

613
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:48,280
is- if that was the case, if, you know, hey, we're looking for some adventure games to

614
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,640
satisfy our fans, then boom, there you go. You have your game right there. You have your

615
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,080
good Mario games.

616
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,240
But Nintendo does this stuff where they have brilliant ideas, and they implement them really

617
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,240
well once, and then they just forget that they ever did it again. Perfect example. Excite

618
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,560
Truck for the Wii when it first came out. Utilize the SC memory card slot, because everyone's

619
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,580
like, holy shit, you know, we can play our own music on there. And then they never did

620
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,240
it again. Oh, oh, I am sorry, they did it once in Endless Ocean, but who gives a fuck?

621
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,560
No one bought Endless Ocean. It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game. If I want to go snorkeling,

622
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,120
I will go outside and go snorkeling. I don't need to play a game to simulate that. But

623
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,600
that was, like, the two times that they ever used that stupid SC memory card slot for anything

624
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,960
other than, later on, game sets.

625
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,700
This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?

626
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,160
It's because they do stupid shit, because now everyone's like, oh, look, look, Project

627
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,680
Grainfall worked! No, no, they did it so they could save face, so they're like, see? We

628
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,200
care about the hardcore gamer. Buy the Wii U. We're gonna put out hardcore games for

629
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,920
it. Then you buy the Wii U, and you're gonna get fucking Mario games, and more fucking

630
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,040
Mario games, and more fucking Mario games, and more Mario games. Oh, and there's gonna

631
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,880
be a Zelda there, because, you know, that's a hardcore game now, and maybe a Metroid that's

632
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
gonna suck.

633
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,440
Can I go? I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting. And rdgsinge

634
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,420
in our chatroom says, the new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year. I'm not

635
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,760
sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you gotta read into it, and

636
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,280
it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games? And I think you can, but

637
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,640
certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about? And I gotta say,

638
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,600
I do hear probably as many people, if not more, talking about Skyrim than I am hearing

639
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,320
about Zelda. Just kind of like on the average, on my Facebook feed, in real life, people

640
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,600
I know that wouldn't go to the extent to read gaming news or download gaming podcasts but

641
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,820
still spend money on video games are playing a lot of Skyrim. But I am hearing some Zelda

642
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:53,840
2, but it seems like five years ago, when it was Twilight Princess, that was all anybody

643
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,120
could talk about. Nobody shared the stage.

644
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,480
That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good

645
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,060
games. And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever,

646
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,000
and some other good Wii games. But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or

647
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,580
sold their Wii, because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to

648
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
play anymore.

649
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,580
That's my Wii.

650
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:19,200
You know, so it's like, well, who cares? And also, Skyward Sword, one system. Skyrim on

651
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,680
a bunch of systems and PCs. So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking

652
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,320
about it. But once again, RPG adventure game. Different. Completely different.

653
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,440
Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.

654
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,480
It's definitely not for Grandma. I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal

655
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,040
to a lot of people. And to be honest, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind

656
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,780
of a risky move for them. I mean, if you think about it, their big thing was, let's get non-gamers

657
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,000
into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.

658
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,220
Yeah, but there's a problem. They were non-gamers for a reason. They don't play games. And yeah,

659
00:52:54,220 --> 00:53:00,080
they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii party didn't sell

660
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,640
very well, because no one buys games that are non-gamers.

661
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,640
Xenoblade may have sold well for some of the stuff, because once again, you're convincing

662
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,960
them it's a party game. But Skyward Sword, not a party game. Not really anything that

663
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,000
non-gamers are going to be interested in. It is kind of, you know, hey, fans of the

664
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,240
series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey, we're still considering

665
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,720
you. And it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform.

666
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:34,560
But at the same time, I just, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever,

667
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,240
I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care. I'm not going to buy it. I mean, especially

668
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,320
when they said GameStop, I'm like, really not going to buy it.

669
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,640
I gotta be honest. Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on

670
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,480
Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April. I am leaning towards, I think I might

671
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:56,200
buy it. It's a good game at the end of the day, despite my displeasure of how they're

672
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,000
fucking this up. I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein

673
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,200
the Dark Sakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff

674
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,800
she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on. It's just kind of

675
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,000
one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a

676
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,160
piece of gaming history. Well, we have almost everything that Working

677
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,640
Designs put out. Same thing. It's kind of one of those things.

678
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,220
Let me word it in a different way then. I'm not fucking begging any goddamn publishers

679
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:28,080
for a fucking game. So you know what? You're here, publishers, to please me as a consumer.

680
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,880
And if you want me to fucking beg and plead to give you money, then you can go fuck yourself

681
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,360
because I'm not doing that. And hey, Nintendo, with your Wii U, if it sucks balls, I'm not

682
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,560
fucking buying it. Or in your goddamn Mario games that come out of there. And yeah, I'll

683
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,260
give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. It'll use probably the touch pad for some other

684
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,000
goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for. Whatever. I don't care. Yeah, I may get

685
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,160
in on 3DS. But I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that

686
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:00,420
has all these classic tracks. What if the Mario game is really good? Like

687
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,640
Mario 3DS Land. Or whatever the hell it's called. Super Mario 3D Land.

688
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,480
One game on a console does not warrant me buying that console. If it's good. It has

689
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,980
to be the majority of the games on the console being good. And I'm sorry if there's other

690
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,120
things on other consoles, especially cross console stuff, I'm gonna get it on a console

691
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,280
that, you know, I don't have to pay extra money for to get some... I mean, like, come

692
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,080
on. Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo. And a lot of games have sold me the systems. You

693
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,660
know, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation. It's true, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation.

694
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,480
There was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii. But you know what? I bought the

695
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:42,880
Wii and I played some of those games and... haven't really touched it since. Played a

696
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,040
little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back, but... I mean, I kinda was like, eh.

697
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,080
It's kind of a waste of my money. And I don't wanna make that mistake again.

698
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,320
Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on, but I'm sure we'll get lots of emails

699
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,840
on it this week. Oh wait, you can't email us. Actually, no. The email should be fixed

700
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,840
mid-week. So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again. Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

701
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,720
Meanwhile, we got more news to cover, so I'm gonna go back to Loki.

702
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,760
Alright. So let's see here. Let's talk a little bit about... this is kinda cool. And I actually

703
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,960
had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind

704
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,120
of reinviged it. There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind

705
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:37,600
some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which

706
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,080
I'm not too familiar with those games, but...

707
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,880
Cause they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.

708
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,680
Yes, and it was funny, cause it was one of my co-workers, who's a friend of one of the

709
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,000
guys at the company, which I gotta talk to that co-worker later on this week. He's like

710
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,040
saying, hey, have you heard these guys? I saw them. They're just down the street from

711
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:06,520
my house. I wonder if you've heard of any of these games or whatever. And I was like,

712
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:13,480
I haven't heard anything. But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware

713
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:21,840
and EA. I guess they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high-quality

714
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:30,280
RPG titles to a fast-growing, highly-engaged, core gamer crowd. And they're also planning

715
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,200
on bringing stuff to social platforms like Facebook and stuff. So maybe seeing Bioware

716
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,840
games on Facebook. Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there on, well

717
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,760
I haven't seen it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook too. Yeah, so more like that

718
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,200
type of game on, you know, cause that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.

719
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,040
And so it's Bioware Sacramento now, that's kind of cool. Yeah, cause that's where we,

720
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,560
if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered, is in Sacramento.

721
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,560
I did a little investigative journalism, if you will. I just wanted to figure out where

722
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,760
these guys were located. I wanted to know if they were downtown or if they were in the

723
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,360
suburb. Well, do you know where they are downtown? I found this fascinating. I actually, because

724
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,000
their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is. So I

725
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:23,920
Googled it and put it in the maps. Guess what they are next door to? The Depot. Oh, fun.

726
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,160
Do you know what the Depot is, our international audience? It's the Gay Bar downtown. The Gay

727
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,480
Bar. No, there's well that it's, it's right at the corner of the kind of where all the

728
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,280
gay bars are down there. So, uh, I think it's hilarious. Bioware Sacramento, Bioware is

729
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,760
now officially next door to a gay bar, which, you know, it's just whatever, but it's, it's

730
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,060
just kind of funny because, you know, especially Bioware has also been kind of one of the leading

731
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:56,200
companies in kind of breaking down that barrier and a lot of their storytelling too, you know,

732
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,960
obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff. Um, Alan's tried and they've got positions

733
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,740
on the website and I think a lot of it's like design stuff too. So you really should. Yeah,

734
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,080
you should look into that. So in fact, we should, gosh, now there's like gaming companies

735
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,520
starting to pop up here. There's, there's us, there's Bioware Sacramento, there's the

736
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,560
Prima Games. People are actually here too. The strategy guys that come out of there.

737
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:27,640
We need to like have a, have a luncheon. I have a short luncheon. Hi two people. We need

738
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,800
to rent out the back room at the spaghetti factory, which is across the street from Bioware

739
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:38,440
Sacramento. Sacramento's not on the website yet. No, but they go to their old name, the

740
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,480
click nation or whatever it's on there. But a lot of that's probably changed. Oh yeah,

741
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,280
I applied with them before as click nation. Yeah. So there you go. A little more gaming

742
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,000
movie and moving into our backyard. That's pretty cool. Anyone all said and done? Yeah.

743
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,320
So good luck to them. I mean, I, I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but you

744
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,240
know, especially with, here's where I could see kind of this going. You know, a lot of

745
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,440
people very excited about the old Republic, which Bioware is a part of. If they can find

746
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,080
the way to the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think there'll

747
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,860
be a step ahead of Warcraft because World of Warcraft, you know, yeah, they've kind

748
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:20,440
of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great. They just kind of published like, Hey,

749
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,520
my character got this achievement and Hey, look at this 3d model of my character. And

750
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,640
it always seems to break whenever there's new patch. So, you know, Blizzard has not

751
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,820
been interfacing with Facebook very well. So this is a chance where Bioware could maybe

752
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:38,920
get a step up. So who knows that these will be the guys to do it or not. So pretty cool.

753
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,440
Fun stuff going on in the backyard. All right. Um, moving on. Lots of reports coming out

754
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,200
of black Friday sales. Of course, black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving

755
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,800
here in the U S because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day. And

756
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,680
now some of the sales numbers are in apparently and Loki will love this. Uh, following up

757
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,960
with the rants, he was just saying there, Nintendo of America in an interview with USA

758
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,400
today mentioned that super Mario 3d land has become the fastest selling portable Mario

759
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,320
game ever. Wait a minute. How many portable Mario games have there been? There was Mario

760
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:20,600
land on the game boy. There was, yeah, but those are all rehashes. They never really

761
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:25,240
did a proper Mario game on the advance specifically made for the advance. Did they, they don't

762
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,960
think they're going to count that anyway. Yeah. Mario Kart. Yeah. So I don't know. Anyway,

763
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,960
so whatever it is, the fastest selling game ever. It moved half a million copies since

764
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,520
November 13th. 3ds system sales are, are up way up to system sales up 325% for the week

765
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:48,740
of November 20th. Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.

766
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:54,880
The we had its biggest black Friday ever. Half a million systems sold on black Friday

767
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,080
alone. They needed that cause they were not selling well at all. The legend is Zelda skyward

768
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:09,860
sword 535,000 copies. Fastest selling Zelda in history. There you go. Lots of stuff coming

769
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:15,760
out of Nintendo, Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too. They moved almost a million

770
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,760
Xbox three sixties on the week of black Friday. They don't say specifically back Friday, but

771
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:29,000
like just under a million three sixties, 750,000 connects that same week. I I'm kind of surprised

772
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,520
that the connect had such a huge year. There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on the

773
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,280
connect right now except maybe like Dan central twos. There's a lot of games out for the connect

774
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:41,920
though. A lot of games out. A lot of, not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are

775
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,480
out, but there's some good stuff. I had to giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox

776
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:51,200
website because they're like connect for core like as in hardcore gamers and they have like

777
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,840
a picture of four zone there. I'm like because it is head tracking has some voice commands

778
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,240
that's hardly connect game and just dance three, which is a connect game, but this is

779
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:06,120
a franchise that was really popular on the we between November 20th and 26 just dance

780
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:17,560
three sold 700,000 copies. Lots Abba. You can dance. No, uh, no, uh, sales figures on that

781
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:23,680
just right now, but I'm telling you, I didn't talk about that game the other week. Oh, it's

782
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:29,760
fabulous. Oh, Rob, dark soccer. Watched me play Abba. You can dance on the way and I

783
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,280
got to say the gayest thing I've ever seen. There was a song. It's really something. There

784
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,400
was a song. You got it. You got to see it. You got to have a ballerina. Yeah. And Rob

785
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,200
was trying to go in point. You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs and he

786
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,040
has like a little ballerina on the screen. So you have to kind of do a little ballerina

787
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:53,360
dance. Hilarious. Um, I think it was the winner takes it all or something. It was Fernando.

788
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:58,140
Maybe I don't know. Whatever. Yeah, no, it was the winner takes it all. I think cause

789
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:07,320
it's a slow song. You know, I had to do the hand sweepy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Anyhow. Oh

790
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,840
God. That was, I have, why isn't Abba you can dance on connect? Anyway, blurry photos

791
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,640
of Rob that better not end up on the internet. I will destroy you. I'm going to call you

792
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:23,000
dance. Squatch. All right. You know, cause every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.

793
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,400
Shush. All right. Uh, let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel around

794
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,240
the world and check out games coming out soon. Although it's probably dried up quite a bit

795
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:36,280
moving past black Friday now. Uh, yeah, it's usually, uh, December is quite a dead month.

796
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,280
In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are

797
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:45,400
probably going to be just a couple titles. But this week we had a Mario Kart seven. Well

798
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,720
today that's on the three DS fortune street coming out on the Wii this week. Uh, Jaws

799
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,600
ultimate predator on the Wii and three DS face racers photo finish on the three DS nano

800
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:04,440
assault on the three DS. Uh, Ubisoft is releasing their own tablet thing to compete with you.

801
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:13,760
Draw the draw some tablet that's coming out. Yeah, it's, it's awesome. Um, outdoors unleashed

802
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,600
Africa and Alaska coming out on three DS, uh, just dance three on the PlayStation three

803
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,760
finally coming out for the PlayStation move. The adventures of Tintin the game on Xbox

804
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:32,880
three 60 PlayStation three we and the three DS. No one Kirk her. I care about 10, 10 bar.

805
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,980
Just know the game will be garbage. It's the game doesn't look like garbage. It's actually

806
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,160
kind of a neat little adventure game. Just not talking about what a, whoa, whoa, whoa,

807
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:46,120
wait, wait. Interruption. Amiga seven seven seven says it's been reported that for me

808
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:56,760
to confirm to connect, we make a blue stinger formula one 2011 for the three DS, the Oregon

809
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:05,240
trail for the Wii and three DS this week. Hell yeah. And, uh, I think my we died of

810
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:11,640
dysentery actually. I believe that is it. All right, then let's move on to Japan and

811
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,000
talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there

812
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,200
this week on December the eighth on the Xbox three 60 Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast connect

813
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,320
Disneyland adventures. Michael Jackson, the experience, boy, that game has been out here

814
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,620
a while, but you're finally getting in Japan this week in regular and limited editions

815
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:36,120
and the elder scrolls. Skyrim comes out in Japan this week. I can't imagine they've localized

816
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,840
everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the, uh, you know, menus and things.

817
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,840
I don't know, but that's, um, interesting. They are bringing that out in Japan. Um, by

818
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,760
the way, next week, huge release final fantasy 13 to this is Japan again. I know we're getting

819
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,960
it early next year. PlayStation three on December the eighth beyond the future fix the time

820
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,060
arrow in regular limited edition Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast. Michael Jackson, the experience

821
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:05,560
need for speed, the run Japan's edition as well as the elder scrolls Skyrim there as

822
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,280
well. I actually did all the voice acting stuff in Japanese. Did they really? Yeah,

823
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,280
they have a lot. They have a trailer that shows it there. It was one, I think it was

824
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,840
on Kotaku. They were saying, which trailer is most or which language trailer is the most

825
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:28,680
epic? And they had a Japanese and German and French and whole bunch of stuff. Um, I'm just

826
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,040
trying, I'm searching the YouTube's right now. Let's see the elder scrolls five Skyrim

827
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,480
Japan trailer. I better not get trolled with this YouTube link. Let's see. We are live

828
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:57,080
folks. Let's see. I'm feeling moved already. I don't know about you guys. There's not a

829
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:17,840
lot of talking.

830
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:34,160
God, this game is really good. I actually do have to say that that's an example of the

831
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,960
Japanese voice acting. It sounds really good. They could be reading this in pig Latin and

832
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,800
I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic. Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire

833
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,640
thing, but there you go. Wow. I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.

834
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,120
So props to them. That's really something else. All right. Also on the PlayStation three

835
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,600
this week, wizardry perfect pack comes out this week. That's a role playing game. I wonder

836
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,560
if that ties into the old ass wizardry series for back in the day. It probably does. Um,

837
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:07,280
let's see on other systems, the PlayStation Vita not out just yet. That is December 17th,

838
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,820
but otherwise anything on the Wii this week, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic

839
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:15,320
games and Michael Jackson, the experience and need for speed. The run, all the versions

840
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,720
on the Wii are out this week as well. Let me check the 3ds lastly real quick. Ah, world

841
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,120
soccer winning 11 2012 soccer games are usually pretty big over there and looks like on a

842
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,640
special release day, the 10th of December, this might be slightly a big G big deal. Monster

843
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,380
Hunter 3g. That's right. The Monster Hunter 3ds game is out. People are going to be piled

844
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:40,720
outside waiting for it. That's slightly a big deal who will be in line. Yeah. Freaking

845
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:47,320
Monster Hunter. All right. Two games in the UK. All right. What on the ninth dizzy Prince

846
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:52,760
of yolk folk on the iPhone and Android and just dance three for PlayStation three. There

847
01:09:52,760 --> 01:10:00,700
you go. All right. Dark soccer. More gaming news please. Well, um, I don't know if Alan

848
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:06,680
knows about this. He does. I trolled him with it already. Well, a valve employee was spotted

849
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:15,480
wearing a half-life three shirt and the person that took the picture, um, John Donna, I think

850
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,560
is how it's pronounced. Um, took, asked permission to take the picture too and put it on his

851
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:28,520
Twitter. So, um, it's a big half-life logo with the three. Yeah. I want to create an

852
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:36,240
actual shirt that has half-life four on it. Just saying that, you know, um, here's the

853
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,840
thing is that a lot of people are going like, OMG and rightfully so like this game needs

854
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,160
to just fucking happen already. But at the same time, valve is totally not above trolling

855
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,460
people and like this whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling. But, um, I hope

856
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,880
it's true. I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true.

857
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:00,800
Um, but, uh, the problem is it could also be a joke. So I mean, is this something that

858
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,440
valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce or they probably would want to

859
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,620
show off the new engine obviously because it would, it would be a new engine. So I imagine

860
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,000
I guess if it's real, maybe, maybe something early next year. Cause you know, what else

861
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,520
is valve working on right now that we know of the dota game? That's about whatever. Yeah.

862
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,600
I'm going to put a picture up on our tumbler. All right. And a salacious pop or Alan is

863
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,800
in our chat right now saying shaking and crying, shaking and crying. I'm there with, I hope

864
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:34,480
it's true. I, I, a lot of people, if it's true, then I'll need new underwear. All right.

865
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:41,840
Valve tried to give us all a little bit of warning. All right. Uh, Loki. All right. Um,

866
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:50,260
so let's see here. This is a kind of a annoying, I guess. You remember how some of these publishers

867
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:55,680
are doing online passes? Well, EA being the first out of the gate with the whole online

868
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,300
passing as part of their project. $10. Well, there's a little something, something that

869
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:06,800
they forgot to mention to you that's in the end user license agreements. You may not have

870
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,920
seen those online passes can expire. That's right. Um, apparently there is a guy that

871
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:20,280
was, um, part of the, uh, new, uh, games are fun, uh, forum. And he posted that his copy

872
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,000
of EA's, uh, need for speed hot pursuit contained the online pass that was expired blocking

873
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,400
him from accessing, or accessing online content. And, uh, I guess there's a bunch of the people

874
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:37,520
that were saying that they ran into the same problem. And, uh, EA, uh, actually came out

875
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,040
and said EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of

876
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:50,640
online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly. Um, and it

877
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,760
apparently is as a rule, no online pass should expire, but a few titles will have a time

878
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:01,880
limit on their use, even new purchases. Um, and dragon H2 for example, has an online pass

879
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:10,440
that expires March 31st, 2012. Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement,

880
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:16,200
it's actually listed in there and says redownloading or getting a new pass is free. EA said, I'm

881
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,760
not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the

882
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:27,720
old pass and it somehow changes the date or something. Um, and it's weird though that

883
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:34,240
they have, you know, they have this in the first place. Why, why even make these expired

884
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:50,080
to begin with? I don't understand why they would do that. Wait for it. Wait for it. Do

885
01:13:50,080 --> 01:14:00,440
I really need to say anything else? I mean, yeah, I just, I just don't understand why,

886
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:05,280
why they would do that in the first place. I mean, that would be like, for example, if

887
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,940
you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically

888
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:15,000
these passes act like download content and it expires. Hey, hey, you know, you like playing

889
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:23,920
that Skyrim DLC. Hope you finished all your quests in it because it's expired. Unfortunately,

890
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:32,600
we made it out of meat. It's no good anymore. You can't consume this download content. You

891
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:46,080
will get sick. I mean, it's just it. I know. I know. I, what else needs to be said? It's

892
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,840
just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting

893
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:57,040
punished over and over again. And it's like, when is this shit going to stop? Oh, and they

894
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,800
even said that apparently, uh, Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and even says on the

895
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:10,680
actual card, it says, uh, the, was it the service network, whatever, um, activation.

896
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:18,560
And it says it's code expires January 1st, 2012. So if you're planning on buying Mass

897
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:27,720
Effect 2, I hope you use that code already. SMH. That's all I have to say. SMH. Moving

898
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:33,280
on. You know, wait, no, not moving on. You know, in California we have this law and I

899
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,520
think some other states have it too. And so federal has certain protections about it.

900
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:42,800
But like, like if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate

901
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:49,620
to the movie theater for his birthday. Okay. And he never uses it, but like three years

902
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:56,140
later he finds it. It's still worth $25. They can't deduct fees. They, if he wants to take

903
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,400
it in for certain amounts, I think it's like up to 10 or $25. He can actually go in and

904
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,960
say, I want the cash back. Then they have to give him the money for it. Like they have

905
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:11,920
to do that. So, um, it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole

906
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,720
kind of around this where things can't, that are worth money like this can expire. I'm

907
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:20,440
going to tell you something else though. In the state of California, gift cards don't

908
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:27,920
expire. Oh yeah, yeah. So why is this stuff expire? I don't think it actually legally

909
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,000
would be able to in the state. They're not, see, but there's, it's not real money, quote

910
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,320
unquote. The online pass technically has no value. It does and it doesn't. It's, it's,

911
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,000
to me it seems like a legal loophole. The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it,

912
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,600
but you've still bought the pass. You've still bought the card, but you didn't really buy

913
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,640
the pass. It was included with your new game. It still has a monetary value attached to

914
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,040
it. They're not, it's nothing that's going to be a game has a monetary value. The past

915
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:02,080
actually does have a monetary value. You didn't buy the game. Let's, I don't agree. I don't

916
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:07,560
agree with what I'm saying. I'm just being there. No, but it's nothing that would stand.

917
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,040
Let's just look at it this way. Okay. What is, what are these passes trying to prevent

918
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,200
anyways? Piracy and use game sales. Okay. That's what they're, they're trying to prevent

919
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:21,840
with these things. What are they encouraging with all this stuff expiring piracy and use

920
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,640
game piracy? No. Well, here's the thing though. Pirates, I'm telling you pirates, it's not

921
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:32,500
a big deal because guess what? Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these

922
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,480
online passes that you happen to throw in their way. Guess what? You can download any

923
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:43,680
DLC for free. Now granted, if, you know, Mass Effect 2 or whatever, that's not a big deal.

924
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,680
And you can't play online with, you know, a JTAG system or something like that, but

925
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,660
you can download all the download content. For example, Saints Row the Third. If you're

926
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:56,400
ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend

927
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,980
that may have, you know, a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version

928
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:06,200
of that online pass download content that works just fine. Of course, legitimate consumers

929
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:11,640
that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what? THQ wants

930
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:17,280
to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares. Or they

931
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:22,680
can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle. It's just

932
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:28,560
a little minor inconvenience, I guess. I mean, and does it stop some use game sales? Maybe

933
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,800
it does. I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in

934
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,920
tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like

935
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:46,600
that. It's not the way to go about it. I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone

936
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:53,680
decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January. Let's say they go and buy it in January and

937
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,320
they got this code, hey, sweet, I can get this free download content. And you go put

938
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,840
it in, code invalid, it's expired. I mean, when they kind of leave a little sour taste

939
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,160
in your mouth, wouldn't you think twice before buying a EA product again? And let's just

940
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,360
say they bought it. Brand new, because I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.

941
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:17,760
Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.

942
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,360
I mean, that would kind of annoy me. That would be like, maybe, what? Well, you should

943
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:32,560
have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier. I mean, thanks. What I think it

944
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,560
comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of

945
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,540
when they're going to drop prices of these things and you see they work in the price

946
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:45,520
of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60. Oh, now we're going

947
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,400
to drop it down to $20 and we're going to take the download vote.

948
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,520
No, not, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually. I think you're giving them

949
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,720
too much credit to plan ahead. I think that's exactly what happened here is that people

950
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,640
didn't plan ahead. And I think that's what's really happening here is somebody put the

951
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,840
cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well,

952
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,000
what about when these things expire? And then when that point came up, somebody just said,

953
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:15,440
ah, fuck them. So that's what happens in boardrooms across America. Fuck them. Moving on, Verizon.

954
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:21,320
I wanted to say fuck them too. Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon,

955
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,140
but if not, well, fuck them too. But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about

956
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,360
Verizon because this sounds like it could be interesting. You know that whole streaming

957
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,200
TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360. Well, Verizon FiOS, I don't know what that is because

958
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,040
we don't have this here. I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse.

959
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:46,040
It's FiOS. It's fiber optic. Okay. Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels

960
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:52,560
from this to your Xbox 360. If you are an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get

961
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,520
the FiOS TV and internet service. So in other words, as long as you could just turn on your

962
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:03,120
TV and get these channels, now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have

963
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:12,480
gold as well. And you'll get 26 of the channels. I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome,

964
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:20,040
but everybody's reporting on it anyway. No, I'm with you because I, as far as, you know,

965
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,720
you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect. I don't care. That's something

966
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:33,880
your TV can't do. Once again, Xbox P break. Once again, why do I need to do that? Okay.

967
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:40,080
I'm telling you in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote

968
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,080
faster than someone can say pause. I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference

969
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:56,520
there. Xbox pause. Did you ask for a puppy? No. Xbox pause. You want to watch jaws? Xbox

970
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:10,320
pause. It's just cannot identify you. Please face sensor. You're not old enough to watch

971
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:20,400
this programming. Here's the thing. I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for

972
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:26,880
stuff in addition to my cable company. Or like, for example, say if I'm ever so inclined

973
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:33,800
to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point? If

974
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:39,520
I have to have cable to watch TV, I'm going to do it without an Xbox. I don't need to

975
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,920
buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV. Chat room to the rescue. The show where every gamer

976
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,780
has a voice. Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this. Alpha Kinetogram in the chat.

977
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:58,500
If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one. Something

978
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:07,440
for the kids room. Loki, would he retort? I can just get another box and okay, that's

979
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:15,240
great. That's great. We can do that, I suppose. Um, but at the same time, I mean, I only watch

980
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:22,960
TV in one room. I don't need that. What about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV

981
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,760
in his room? Then he can watch TV in his room because by then I'm sure we'll have something

982
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:34,280
better than the Xbox streaming. Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream

983
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:40,600
cable, we got a problem. I mean, hell, you can, you can get like dish installed like

984
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,680
four receivers or whatever. I'm not going to do that. Like they always say, but we could

985
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,920
install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms. Like I'm only

986
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,000
one person. I can watch TV in one room at a time. I don't need four receivers. Why am

987
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,800
I going to want, Hey wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.

988
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:08,020
Yeah. You know what? I have the internet. Fuck receivers. I'm already paying for a high

989
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:13,920
speed internet. That's my DVR. I can watch shit whenever I want on any system. And I

990
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,200
like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your like iPod and stuff like, well,

991
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,400
first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small till then you'll watch TV show

992
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:27,680
on my iPod. But um, yeah, it's kind of cool that they have it. Now if I could use my Xbox

993
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:32,280
360 as a DVR to DVR those programs and watch them later on, then yes, that would be an

994
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,040
added value. That would be fucking awesome. But they're not going to do that because then

995
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:41,560
that means cable company doesn't get money. Um, so they're of course not going to do that.

996
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,680
So watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal. Now here's the

997
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,600
thing though that would interest me is if they're in HD because I currently don't pay

998
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,640
for the HD package because I chose to go the route. I was actually going to go the route

999
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:00,800
of no cable, but they said, Hey, for $2 extra, we can give you cable. And I'm like, okay,

1000
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:09,400
two bucks. I can do that. $2. But it's actually, it's the additional stuff on top of like channels

1001
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,760
that are not on my TV that I'm interested in. Like if they have like gaming channels

1002
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,480
or something like ESPN Ocho, the Ocho. Now if they have additional stuff, that's kind

1003
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:24,800
of what I'm interested in as far as like the stuff that's offered from Verizon or dish

1004
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,680
or direct TV or whatever. Maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently

1005
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:38,360
powered on. How about that? Wouldn't that be something? You know what? JD Ross major

1006
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,700
now Ross is not working. Major. Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.

1007
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:51,840
Think about it. Could be the major Nelson hour majors could be the major Nelson channel.

1008
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:58,960
Just camera fixed on major Nelson all day long majors mini series. Maybe dark Sakura.

1009
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:05,960
We need another news story please. Um, animal crossing. This one's actually kind of different.

1010
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:13,040
Yeah, they say that now, but um, you actually play as the mayor and you can customize your

1011
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,240
town and you have a secretary. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Now I'm the mayor. Now you're

1012
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:22,280
the mayor. Do people have to do what I say? Probably. You also have a secretary named

1013
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:30,360
Shizu and uh, the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike

1014
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:34,720
so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently

1015
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:41,120
too. And your clothes, you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts. So now that I'm

1016
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:47,280
the mayor, will I be able to evict Tom Nook? I wish. Well you have to deal with problems.

1017
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:53,440
Like will all the animals like start occupying on your front lawn happen? We've got, am I

1018
01:26:53,440 --> 01:27:00,440
going to have to send out, um, Rossetti to mace the villagers of the town? Can I finish

1019
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:07,200
my story? Hands on mayor. I'm going to take this shit in my own hand. Grab a shovel. Well,

1020
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:20,120
hit the bug net. It's time to discipline people. Can I finish reading my story, Rob? No. Okay.

1021
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:24,420
Rob shaking and crying. He's looking forward to this so much. I just wish somebody other

1022
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,960
than Nintendo would make these games cause then they might be really funny. Well, you've

1023
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:35,280
got a furniture shop where you can design your own cushions for your furniture. Uh,

1024
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,360
you can make changes to your home exterior. You have fence posts, mailbox, basically

1025
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:46,600
it's like the Sims with animals, but different. Uh, and the, the town's also bigger and has

1026
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:55,800
a shopping mall and you have a huge beach and you can swim in the ocean. Ooh. And uh,

1027
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:02,880
you can actually exchange house designs with people, um, through street pass, like a model

1028
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:11,400
home. Look, you know what this means? And draw Cox on him. Uh, Oh, uh, Oh. These street

1029
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:21,720
paths has left his store. He has a new job. He's the town's real estate agent. Oh, great.

1030
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:29,960
Tom Nook's a little asshole, but no wonder the housing market's screwed. I just want

1031
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:35,240
to the KK to be awesome in it forever. Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over animal

1032
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:47,560
crossing. Occupy Nooks. I'm just like, really? I'm switching to a really design your own

1033
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:53,400
couch cushions. I don't fucking care. Well, I'm looking, Oh wow. You actually, your, your

1034
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:59,160
little character looks a lot different. I thought those real people were like, Oh, that's

1035
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:06,080
realistic. Some Japanese dude know what sad is they're trapped in your little town and

1036
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,200
they have to sing and dance for you to get out. I'm looking at this little thing, which

1037
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,600
I really shouldn't be, but I'm looking at it. Oh wait. Hey, I can look at it and then

1038
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:19,560
the audio will play all over the feed for everybody to hear. That'll be fun. Let's see.

1039
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:26,400
Pull up the link here. Oh, it's all in Japanese. That's okay. We had a Japanese trailer earlier.

1040
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:32,000
Oh wow. The people actually do look quite a bit different. The little, the little characters.

1041
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:46,880
I mean the animals. This is kind of boring. When do we see the people? It's like peppered

1042
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:57,640
throughout the video. All right. That video is about as exciting as animal crossing is

1043
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:08,200
on the second day. Hey. All right. I'm probably going to get it in a 3DS. Let's move on. Loki.

1044
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:16,180
Um, well unfortunately it is the end of game pro. Um, they're going to cease publication

1045
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:21,520
altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly. It will be their last issue

1046
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:29,200
and uh, basically the website is shutting down tomorrow on the fifth and um, they're

1047
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:36,000
done. So, uh, can I say something about that real quick? Yeah. Now I saw a lot of people

1048
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,560
on Twitter kind of eulogizing this, which I completely understand you. I remember reading

1049
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,380
game pro magazine when I was younger and it was, you know, one of the ways to get gaming

1050
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,320
news and so forth. And I do kind of feel bad for the people that lost their jobs and so

1051
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,860
forth through this because, you know, I bet a lot of these people probably read those

1052
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:56,120
magazines growing up and really had a dream of working at game pro or working at a game

1053
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:01,140
magazine and they got that and then, oh shit, it all changed. And now, you know, the job's

1054
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:05,240
not there anymore that they wanted. I can see that's gotta be really depressing and

1055
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:09,680
so forth. And there's a lot of people online kind of eulogizing game pro saying, can't

1056
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:13,640
believe this happened. It's, it's sad that this happened. And I'm just thinking if everybody

1057
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:19,120
that was eulogizing game pro actually bought the magazine or went to the website, it's

1058
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:23,360
probably wouldn't have happened. You know, that make me a bitch for thinking that I was

1059
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:28,240
in the store today. Oh, you're a bitch anyway. I was in the store today and I was walking

1060
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,620
down the magazine aisle and I saw PC gamers sitting there. PC gamer. I used to buy it

1061
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:39,000
all the time cause they'd have CDs full of demos and all this shit. PC gamer. I, as far

1062
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,480
as I could tell, flipping through the magazine, no CD or DVD to be had whatsoever. $8.99 for

1063
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,480
that fucking magazine. Fuck that. That's why I'm not buying magazines because they're too

1064
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:57,320
goddamn expensive. And game pro, yeah, you know, um, it was great back in the day when

1065
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:01,000
the internet wasn't around. Unfortunately now everything is digital and print magazines

1066
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,800
unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store. Um, then you're not going to

1067
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:16,080
do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives, you really have to buy them or somehow leverage

1068
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:20,600
them out of these companies. And most of the stuff, you know, that may be in your magazines

1069
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:27,120
already a month old by the time, you know, everything goes around. It's tough. You gotta

1070
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:34,020
figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time sensitive material. And that's

1071
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:37,480
tough because that's what people want. That's why retro gamers are great magazine cause

1072
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:44,640
you're not expecting to see new stuff in there. So anyhow, um, interesting comment from Game

1073
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,960
Guru in the chat room. I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no

1074
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:56,680
gaming magazine besides PC gamer. See my favorite magazine right now is actually, um, retro

1075
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:05,240
gamer. It's a British magazine. That's all old video games. The one I just mentioned.

1076
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:11,000
Retro gamer is a very, okay. And keep in mind my, my career, what I'm going to make a career

1077
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,200
of is print publication. And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort

1078
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:22,640
into it printed on nice glossy stock. Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should

1079
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:29,640
warn you it's going to be rough. I know. I got to tell you guys about this gaming magazine

1080
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:34,600
that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games

1081
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:41,960
in there. It's a magazine called retro gamer. I don't know if you've heard of it. Shut up.

1082
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,760
All right. All right. Um, another thing that unfortunately went by the wayside as well.

1083
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:54,240
Um, the website game set watch is ending its six year run. Um, basically what's going on

1084
01:33:54,240 --> 01:34:00,680
there is, um, they're basically stopping because they're having a lot of overlap with their

1085
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:06,240
sister site, indie games.com. And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of

1086
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,480
the best material out there is being indie related. Uh, they're just going to kind of

1087
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:17,000
focus mainly on indie games.com. Also mainstream game blogs are doing much better job nowadays,

1088
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,420
including the weirder and alt links and among the other gaming news. Yeah, I think a lot

1089
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:27,000
of these gaming websites, to be honest nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.

1090
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:34,760
Oh, hey, one game blog covered it. Let me cover it as well. And I mean, Kotaku, I read

1091
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:41,760
you daily and joystick, you know, um, Kotaku. I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I

1092
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,600
don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny. Uh, you know, how

1093
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,160
many videos can I watch? Someone's spawning cheese and having to roll it down a Hill.

1094
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,320
I mean, yeah, it's funny. The first time it's funny, but I don't, I don't need to see that

1095
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,520
every single time. But, um, you know, I, I, I don't know. Yeah, there's a lot of, a lot

1096
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:06,000
of sites out there for getting your news kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know,

1097
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,920
why we don't really cover a lot of the news because I mean, really do you need another

1098
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:14,960
source for, you know, website? No, we do talk about news, but just what we do is to have

1099
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,540
some play. I have some walls. I mean, it once again, it's, it's all about, you know, hey,

1100
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:26,320
we all have day jobs, um, it in our own lives and stuff. I mean, it's, once again, it's,

1101
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,380
we're not going to be there, you know, right away unless we have some sort of scoop on

1102
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:36,600
something, which is not very often cause we're not doing this professionally. Um, that it's

1103
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,600
impossible for, you know, anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites

1104
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,900
are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that. And we're

1105
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:56,700
just a few people and we just can't do it. So we concede. All right. Uh, moving on. Since

1106
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,700
Loki talked about, uh, how much he, uh, it gets sees a Skyrim information over saturating

1107
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:06,580
the internet. Let's talk about Skyrim and a Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out

1108
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:12,260
this week. A PlayStation three, X-Box three 60 and PC. And apparently, Oh, not doing too

1109
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:16,800
good. It's, it's kind of buggy. A lot of users are reporting. Various issues are going on

1110
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,680
with the game. Uh, apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance. That could

1111
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,500
be an issue. Think about it. Yeah. The bug list is quite funny actually down the bottom

1112
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:30,700
there. Uh, this, this here unofficial bug list. Oh, let me look at that. Just mentioning

1113
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:34,800
some of the things. All right, let's look at this. Oh, is this like, Oh, something.

1114
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,780
Somebody actually posted this on their own forums. Good Lord. Well, it's actually the

1115
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:42,340
Bethesda forums. Yes. Yeah. But this isn't Bethesda that posted this. It's an unofficial

1116
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:48,300
list. Yikes. Let's see. The dark brotherhood. Cal does not show a face mask. Only seems

1117
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:54,460
to work for females, but doesn't show up for males. Hmm. Um, Oh, what, where's the funny

1118
01:36:54,460 --> 01:37:01,180
stuff? Well, character's getting stuck running. Um, you know, well obviously the, uh, resistance

1119
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:08,440
is not being there. Uh, dragons flame backwards or erratic destruction. Trainers are not letting

1120
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:16,140
me train. Markarth guards always try to arrest the player. Invisibility is being undone by

1121
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:22,420
the shadow warrior perk for sworn conspiracy when going back to meet L tree players sometimes

1122
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:29,980
finds him dead. Oh, uh, this is a funny one. Uh, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers was telling

1123
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:34,980
me about, uh, he was playing and I guess one of his followers died. I think it might've

1124
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:40,540
been Lydia. Um, cause she's the first, like, well, not really the first floor, but the,

1125
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:46,900
the one you get appointed to by the URL. And, um, so apparently she got smashed by a troll

1126
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:52,600
or a giant. She got smashed by a giant. Well, she didn't die. She kind of resurrected herself,

1127
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:56,700
but she was still flat. And so she slipped around like a snake for about eight hours

1128
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:03,680
in game. And then he was telling me also later on the game, like another person had died.

1129
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:08,300
And so he's getting married or whatever. And like everybody keeps like walking in there.

1130
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:12,460
This is just an outrage. This is disgusting. This bride keeps like storming off and stuff

1131
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,620
like that. He's kept reloading and seems like, what the hell is going on? I can't fucking

1132
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:20,220
understand what's going on. Looks down. There's the corpse of the person that died like days

1133
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:27,860
ago and just like somehow teleported to your wedding. He wanted to come see it. But yeah,

1134
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:32,100
I remember one of the patch bugs was like preventing people that have died from appearing

1135
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:39,280
at your wedding dead. That's always a bummer. Um, I guess dragons are flying backwards.

1136
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,720
That's another big thing that's going on right now. That's great. Well, Bethesda has come

1137
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:49,560
out and said, you know, we, uh, promised to be more careful with patches in the future.

1138
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:55,040
And my friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a monk, a dead monk in a jail cell,

1139
01:38:55,040 --> 01:39:01,900
except he looked like he was, uh, spasming all over the place. All right. LOL. Skyrim's

1140
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:06,120
buggy. We get it. Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy. I mean, as great

1141
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:11,980
as the game of Skyrim is, geez, it's kind of buggy. And, uh, you know, we didn't remember

1142
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,900
when they couldn't patch games. Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?

1143
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:20,060
Oh, you mean like on the Wii? And if you were gonna, if you were gonna patch him, you just

1144
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:26,140
released a new game. We're going to take a step back to simpler times. Maybe it's a Wii

1145
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:30,180
game this week, apparently, since now that's a classic gaming system. It's not a Wii game.

1146
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:39,500
It's a classic game of the week. The classic game is a game that I've actually done the

1147
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,500
full version of before, but I haven't done this specifically. So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas

1148
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:52,980
Nights. It's my family tradition, dammit. So, um, basically, you, you know, fly around,

1149
01:39:52,980 --> 01:40:01,540
collect balls, put them in the idea cap, uh, machine, and go fight a boss. Yay. What? Nothing.

1150
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:05,740
Just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees

1151
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:12,140
that put the balls in for the, you know, the family guy jokes. I never saw it. Sorry. Anyway,

1152
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:17,860
with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December, 1986

1153
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:23,780
in Japan. It came with this Christmas Saturn bundle. And everywhere else, it was given

1154
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:28,820
away with a purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and

1155
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:35,580
was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Game Players, and Net Generation Magazine. Um,

1156
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:41,340
it actually, though, um, if you got the magazine, the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't

1157
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,780
have a slip cover. It just had a, a transparent one. Um, but it has its own, like, little

1158
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,340
special cover. In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this. It got its

1159
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:55,860
own jewel case and everything. Sucks. So with this one, um, it has the full version of,

1160
01:40:55,860 --> 01:41:01,420
um, one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley. Um, but both Claris and Elliot can play through

1161
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,300
it. Um, Elliot couldn't in the full game. And he has a different layout than Claris'

1162
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:11,420
one. This is actually a little harder. So basically, um, the way the story goes is that

1163
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:16,220
they, uh, notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in

1164
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:22,220
the center of town. So they go into Mytopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.

1165
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:32,220
Um, at any rate, um, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it. Um, in November

1166
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:38,380
and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition. Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition,

1167
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:45,420
but it changed to Winter Nights. In December, it becomes Christmas Nights. Um, and then

1168
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:51,580
the entire, uh, area that you go through instead of being all springtimey turns into wintry

1169
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:57,900
places. And the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.

1170
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:04,300
Um, you have, uh, presents everywhere. The music, as you can hear, is like a different

1171
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,100
version of Jingle Bells. Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?

1172
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:24,540
There's also, um, the other changes in the game. Um, well, you also do have to fight

1173
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:29,900
the, um, the boss, which is Gilling from, of course, the last one, and save the star

1174
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:35,260
from his lair, which is actually attached to his butt. And it's really fun and cool.

1175
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:40,140
Now, the other neat stuff that happens is that, um, the weather in Spring Valley will

1176
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:45,020
change depending on the hour. And then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's

1177
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:49,740
Day, where instead of playing Nights, you play as Diala, which is pretty cool. It also

1178
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:54,460
has a ton of hidden goodies in it. Like, one of the things that we unlocked last night was,

1179
01:42:54,460 --> 01:43:01,580
um, the trailer from Tokyo Game Show in 1996 when the game came out. Um, they call it Christmas

1180
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:06,460
presents mode. You get, like, a time attack. You can get a special Link challenge. And

1181
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:12,300
you also get a special level called Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams. So, Sonic goes

1182
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:20,860
through Spring Valley on foot. And, um, you fight, uh, a bouncy ball version of Robotnik

1183
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:26,460
slash Eggman. And the music is a remixed version of Final Fever, which was the final boss music

1184
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:30,620
from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD. As I'm sure I've mentioned before,

1185
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:36,300
they changed the US music. So, it's really neat. It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.

1186
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:41,660
You know, there's even a karaoke mode, which you can sing the little theme song. And it's

1187
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:48,620
really fun. So, it was a freebie, which was even better. So, this is back in the day when,

1188
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:55,660
you know, they would do nice shit for us. Don't you remember? I do. So, that's your classic game,

1189
01:43:55,660 --> 01:44:02,300
Mr. Christmas Nights. Ho, ho, ho. There it is. Yeah, I love also children's books.

1190
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:11,580
There you go. Yeah. Christmas Nights.

1191
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:16,220
There it is, your classic game of the week. So, so time appropriate. I appreciate that.

1192
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:19,340
We're going to take a quick break, guys. But when we come back, there's plenty more Orange

1193
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:23,180
Laundry to come. We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced

1194
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:28,540
this past week. That's going to be, uh, Lolsy. Uh, a special email bag. Somebody managed to get

1195
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:31,820
an email in anyway, even though the email's down. We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.

1196
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:36,300
And another game going free to play. We're going to talk about all that when we come back with

1197
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:47,740
more of Orange Lounge Radio. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on

1198
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:55,100
this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show. This show's been

1199
01:44:55,100 --> 01:45:00,700
going on a long time. I just want to point out. Every time you say the 37, I want to go in a row.

1200
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:05,180
Right. Yeah. So during the break, uh, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about

1201
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:09,180
Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays and some folks

1202
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:13,420
were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas? And so we were sitting here thinking

1203
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:20,300
like, well, Dark Sakura doesn't really do Christmas now. I mean, you do, but you don't. Well, it's kind

1204
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:26,540
of like a non-issue thing, right? Dan and I do Christmas Eve. Okay. And, and then we'd go to

1205
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:32,380
family stuff to eat free food. And we're doing stuff with, um, now Alan and I are doing stuff

1206
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:37,660
with Alan's side of the family, but I don't know when that'll be done. We might be done by, I seem

1207
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:40,700
to remember last year, we were kind of out of there about like four or five. So we'll see,

1208
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:44,300
but I don't want to rush it. So I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not.

1209
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:50,300
Probably not, but never say never. Right. So I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and

1210
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:54,700
eat it live on air. It would be fun to do a Chinese food Christmas special, but you know,

1211
01:45:54,700 --> 01:46:00,620
we'll see. Um, anyhow, uh, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not you

1212
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:05,500
guys. Um, the good news is the next week, uh, should be easy. So we'll have one week off for

1213
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:10,300
the holidays and that should be it. Um, we'll let you know more about that in the next couple of

1214
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:14,060
weeks. Cause believe it or not what Christmas is only about what three weeks away from today.

1215
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:20,460
So yikes. All right. Jester Scott in our chat room says, take a day off peeps.

1216
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,780
That's true. We deserve a day off. That's what we're getting for the holidays. A day off.

1217
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:31,180
Let's go to Disneyland. Don't even tempt me. All right. We're going to get back into some more

1218
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:35,340
gaming news. Uh, your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets. Make sure you

1219
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,940
get your tweets in because especially since the email bag has been down this week, we're really

1220
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:43,020
relying on your tweets. So get those into twitter.com slash O L R. We don't have quite as

1221
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:48,220
much news this half of the show as we did in the first half of the show. So we definitely need your

1222
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:53,820
calls and tweets tonight. So do we have a, do we have a work injury? What's going on? Dark Sockar

1223
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:58,540
says she has a splinter. I have a splinter. All right, go do what you need to do. All right.

1224
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:02,620
Loki will read some news. We'll take care of it. Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.

1225
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:06,780
I'll do the news, I guess. Uh, so let's talk a little bit about

1226
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:15,180
Zynga and apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of

1227
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:23,260
a franchise with angry birds in it. Um, they were, apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for

1228
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:31,500
2.25 billion dollar acquisition from Zynga. So that's, that's a lot of pride right there.

1229
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:39,100
Good for them. That's what I have to say. Good, good for them that they rejected that offer from

1230
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:45,260
Zynga because, you know, Zynga is kind of not the, um, I don't know, Zynga is kind of like,

1231
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:51,260
you know how Google says do no evil? Well, Zynga does evil. That's kind of what they do. And that's

1232
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:59,820
what they do best is evil stuff like Facebook and all that stuff. So, so Loki, why don't you do one

1233
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:06,220
more story since Dark Sockar's out of the room. Why don't you, um, tell us about that role playing

1234
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:16,060
game that's coming out very soon. If you can load up the story here if it, if it'll work.

1235
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:24,540
All right. Sweet. Um, let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is great. South Park, you know,

1236
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:34,060
they've had a lot of, eh, okay games and then of course they have to go and, and Dark Sockar is

1237
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:41,340
bleeding apparently. No, um, and now it's come out to say something nasty, but I didn't. Thank God.

1238
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:46,300
I, I appreciate that you did not say I was going to take it there. And then I said, you know what,

1239
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:50,460
I'm not going to take it there. Um, you know, that would explain a lot about why she's so upset.

1240
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:56,860
Uh, yeah. You know what? I know that Alan would really like for you to come home. Eventually

1241
01:48:56,860 --> 01:49:01,100
South Park. You were saying South Park. Uh, they have a, well, they have an Xbox live arcade game.

1242
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:06,860
The, uh, the kind of side scroller co-op game, the South Park's Tenorman's Revenge, which is coming

1243
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:10,060
out a little bit later on, but this isn't what we're talking about. We're talking about what was

1244
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:15,340
revealed from the new cover of Game Informer. Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company

1245
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:22,140
that can get exclusives when no one else can. Um, they have a new South Park game. Get the covers

1246
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:25,820
already on the internet before it's in your mailbox. Well, they, they pimp that out usually

1247
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:33,340
early on the Game Informer site. Um, they have a new RPG coming from Obsidian, the folks behind

1248
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:40,140
the latest, uh, Fallout New Vegas. And, uh, it is going to be an RPG. And, uh, of course,

1249
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:46,940
all 2D and everything. Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360,

1250
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:53,260
PlayStation 3, and PC. And, uh, what's kind of cool about it though is they also have, uh,

1251
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:58,620
some details out about it. Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about

1252
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:04,300
you fitting in, I guess. And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be

1253
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:09,580
completely customizable. Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff

1254
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:16,860
like that. Um, and, uh, I think it's pretty awesome looking. They're saying it's gonna

1255
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:21,180
combine, like, a bunch of different things. The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.

1256
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:27,180
Uh, the weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from

1257
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:35,340
7. Um, also they're saying that, of course, the entire game's gonna be 2D. Um, or at least look

1258
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:40,060
hand drawn, I guess. I gotta say I'm a little worried though because the other South Park games

1259
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:44,460
that have come out today have been kind of crappy. Granted, this is a new company doing this. Like,

1260
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:48,380
who did the Nintendo 64 one? That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it? And that one,

1261
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:52,380
that was that first person shooter. It really wasn't that good. So, I mean, you know, there's

1262
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:56,940
been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live arcade games, like, you know, there was the Let's Play

1263
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:01,020
Tower Defense and all this. But there haven't been a lot of, like, really good South Park games. But

1264
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:04,940
I think a lot of that is because Matt and Trey haven't really been involved. But it sounds like

1265
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:07,980
they're involving themselves in this. Like, you know, some of the stuff I was reading about,

1266
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:13,100
like, how they actually designed what the town square would look like. They gave feedback to the

1267
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:18,700
designers. Like, the designers wanted to do, like, Ike got kidnapped as a wolf as, like,

1268
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:25,020
a story in the game or something. And the creators are like, no. So, it's good that it has their

1269
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:33,020
input. Yes. I don't know. I'm excited. I'd buy it. Yeah. I'll definitely check that out. I mean,

1270
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:39,500
you know, the demo and so forth is very important. But it's so funny that South Park is still going

1271
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,780
after all these years. I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons too. God, The Simpsons has been on

1272
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:48,380
forever. The Simpsons is still going. But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of

1273
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:55,660
college. I was, what, 97 and it's still on the air. And people talk about, boy, South Park is so

1274
01:51:55,660 --> 01:52:02,540
old. Which means I'm so old. All right. Rob. What? I'm older than you. Oh, yeah, that's true.

1275
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:10,940
All right. Moving on. There's always rumors about what is coming next on Microsoft's front. And this

1276
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:17,500
isn't specifically about the Xbox loop. But this is about the Kinect 2. Which I could have sworn

1277
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,420
we were talking about some of this last week. But for whatever reason... How are we talking about

1278
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:26,860
Kinect for PC? I think so. But I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week.

1279
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:32,540
So, here's the deal. Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect. And Kinect

1280
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:37,180
2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected,

1281
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:41,340
right? A more high def camera is all you really need. And maybe a better microphone in there. I

1282
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:45,740
don't know. Or a higher sound sampling. But apparently, it's gonna have some other technical

1283
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:50,860
stuff in it as well. It's going to be able to read lips. It will be able to detect the direction

1284
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:58,060
that you're facing and recognize your emotional state. It's a little bit creepy. Why are you so

1285
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:03,660
sad? I'm not sad. Why are you sad? Yeah, that's what I need. My Xbox. Because I don't hear it

1286
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:09,740
enough on Xbox Live, I now need the Xbox device itself to sit there and go, you mad? You mad? And

1287
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:16,140
start teabagging me. That's exactly what I want my Xbox to do, IRL. Well, look, a lot of this is just

1288
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:20,540
what? A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device. The fact that it would

1289
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:24,460
be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising. It was stuff

1290
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:27,420
that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough

1291
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:31,820
camera resolution. It didn't have the power! But now it will have the power, I'm assuming,

1292
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:36,140
if there's going to be a Kinect 2 or whatever with the Xbox lube whenever it comes out.

1293
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:42,700
So apparently one of the reasons why it's going to be more powerful, it will not utilize USB,

1294
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:46,220
and therefore it's not going to be hampered by the USB speeds.

1295
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:51,100
This is why the Kinect right now is somewhat limited. So there you go.

1296
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:59,580
You know, the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing. I mean, especially for

1297
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:05,500
what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth, or folks, you know. It's going to be

1298
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:10,460
really neat, I think. It's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now, like when they showed

1299
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:14,700
FaceTime for the first time and how deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of have phone calls.

1300
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:18,300
So it's pretty awesome. So it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up

1301
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:20,860
in that regard. That's cool.

1302
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:24,620
Yeah, very cool. It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like,

1303
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:27,500
the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.

1304
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:34,060
So there you go. All right, we're going to go to our email bag. Now, here's the thing.

1305
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:39,500
We don't really have like a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week. I would

1306
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:45,500
say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1307
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:50,060
However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in

1308
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:54,620
Azeroth, hoardhouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning. And one of our special

1309
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:59,420
guests all the way from the other side of the pond, Sill, beat me on Skype and said,

1310
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:03,100
I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. And I said, well, we don't have an email right

1311
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:06,860
now. She said, but I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. I said, okay, send it to me

1312
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:13,100
and I'll have Jamie read it. And yeah, I know the topic she's talking about tonight is one that we

1313
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:17,260
kind of tried to avoid, but that's all right. It's where every gamer has a voice. Let's,

1314
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,580
let's talk about it. It's Dark Soccer. Would you read the email please?

1315
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:22,700
Hello guys. Where's my music?

1316
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:27,180
We also, oh shit. That's right. You need mailbag music. We also love Sill and we'll do whatever

1317
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:29,340
she wants. I mean, really at the end of the day, right?

1318
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,100
Sill is my hero.

1319
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:31,580
That's right.

1320
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:37,740
Email.

1321
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:43,740
Hello guys. I'm so sorry for what happened to the website and I hope it will be,

1322
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:47,740
I'll be resolved quickly. Now I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet,

1323
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:52,380
but it seriously made me facepalm and I'm not even giving anybody the address because

1324
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:57,180
it's retarded. It's called Mario Kills Tanuki. It's on the PETA website. If you really want to

1325
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:58,540
find it, find it. But I don't care.

1326
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:02,780
It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving. So

1327
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:05,100
I think a lot of people heard of this.

1328
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:11,660
I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end,

1329
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:16,300
points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our

1330
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:20,540
inner beings and morals. I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never

1331
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:25,500
felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat. What is your feeling about what PETA did

1332
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,980
here? I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing

1333
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:34,380
up Shermie now and taking measurements. Then I haven't said anything. Love the show.

1334
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:37,020
So first of all, Shermie.

1335
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:41,260
Oh, the hell is that ringtone?

1336
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:46,220
My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is bitches by mindless self-indulgence.

1337
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:51,500
Okay. Um, apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now. So, um,

1338
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:59,420
what I, what the fuck was I saying? Oh yeah. First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.

1339
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:03,100
It's a bullshit organization. They put more animals to sleep,

1340
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:11,180
or I should just say they murder more animals than they help. They're second in command.

1341
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:17,180
Um, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, um,

1342
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:24,300
they're, uh, second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal derived insulin.

1343
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:33,660
Just saying. Their main leader is a sociopath who, um, basically has stated that she would rather

1344
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:41,260
all humanity die than have and have the world ruled by animals. So just throw that out there.

1345
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:44,540
She's crazy. Oh, but animals are so fuzzy wuzzy.

1346
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:49,100
No, she says that she wants all humans to die. Okay.

1347
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:56,700
So, um, Ingrid Newman, I think is her name. So anyway, we've got this organization

1348
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:04,140
that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that are

1349
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:10,140
we surprised at all that they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at,

1350
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:14,300
you know, basically their target age group, which is gamer age. You know,

1351
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:18,060
they're trying to get, get them young, get them in our, our little bracket.

1352
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:21,420
Cause we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.

1353
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:27,020
PETA makes so much money. PETA is smart. They are very smart

1354
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:32,140
because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community. This isn't the first

1355
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:37,340
time they've done something like this and they know that they will get completely free

1356
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:41,820
advertising for a very long time from doing something like this. I like how they kind of

1357
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:46,860
went back on it and said, Oh, it's just a joke, but whatever they're like weird ass reasoning

1358
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:52,300
was or whatever, an audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought,

1359
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,860
the majority of which probably this already wouldn't give him a second thought,

1360
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:59,900
couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.

1361
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:03,100
It was the week. We didn't, I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have

1362
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:08,460
a show unexpectedly. Remember? So that's when this all kind of came up. So, you know,

1363
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:13,580
PETA is very smart at what they're doing. And this is all part of a calculated plan to drive

1364
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:20,220
more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer. It's like you sit there in your inbox

1365
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:25,420
and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or the, you won the lottery

1366
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:29,020
or congratulations, you're really the million- Make it Asian boobs! You're really the millionth

1367
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:34,620
visitor to this website and you really did win this. But if one person falls for it, then-

1368
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:41,020
I wish I had not clicked the link because I hate, I delete every PETA link that's in my

1369
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:47,500
every PETA link that's in my viewing history. No, seriously. They don't get, I do not give them

1370
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:55,100
attention. Let me, what I think is interesting about Sil's email is what she's really framing

1371
01:59:55,100 --> 02:00:02,140
it as in that paragraph there is she says, I really hate how an organization can tell us that

1372
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:09,100
we are being influenced by games. Yeah. I thought that was really important because that is not

1373
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:14,700
unique to PETA. That is absolutely not unique to this organization. This is just the most recent

1374
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:22,460
example of this is that there's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for

1375
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:28,140
political office, mind you. This is far and above any organization. People that actually wield

1376
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:36,060
actual power that think gamers are stupid. Gamers are easily influenced. Gamers care nothing about

1377
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:41,340
more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.

1378
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:47,500
You know, like there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when

1379
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:52,940
the reality is, especially now, thanks to Facebook, guess what? We're all gamers.

1380
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:59,580
And I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing

1381
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:04,380
as opposed to what they were doing before. When PETA made fun of what was it? Super Meat Boy was

1382
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:08,380
one of the games they did before. They did a Cooking Mama one too. Most people don't know

1383
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:15,340
Super Meat Boy. Most people don't know Cooking Mama. Everybody fucking knows Mario and especially

1384
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:21,420
Mario 3. What person in their 20s or 30s or hell, even most teens that weren't born when this game

1385
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:29,580
came out, what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3? Or older. I mean,

1386
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:34,460
really. My mother played the game with me. Sure. Sure. You don't have to. But I'm just saying,

1387
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:38,220
once you get above a certain age, you find more people that may truly not have known it because,

1388
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:42,620
you know, video games, that's what the crazy kids are into. But if they're older and had kids,

1389
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:49,020
they know it through their kids. You know? Because I knew plenty of my friends, their parents played

1390
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:56,220
Mario with them. And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling

1391
02:01:56,220 --> 02:02:01,500
because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no. I know this Mario game and

1392
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:07,340
you're being stupid. Yeah. People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like

1393
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:12,780
that that they didn't know. But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki

1394
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:17,900
suit, like, here's the thing. And it still goes on in the email to say something like,

1395
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:22,700
I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat

1396
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:27,180
and wear him like a hat. But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is,

1397
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:31,580
I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch six and seven-year-olds when they

1398
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:35,820
play. A lot of them are little freaks. And I mean that in a good way. But a lot of them will pretend

1399
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:41,020
to be Tanooki Mario, like, oh, I'm flying or I'm a Tanooki statue. You know, they'll stay. I mean,

1400
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,700
and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb. But guess what? When you were six or

1401
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:50,540
seven, you were that dumb. Yeah. So you didn't want to skin your cat. You just wanted to be

1402
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:55,420
Tanooki Mario. Mario was your freaking hero. Sure me, baby. I'm not going to skin you,

1403
02:02:55,420 --> 02:03:00,300
but I will use you as socks. All I have to do is have her sit on my feet. Anyway. But anyway,

1404
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:05,580
my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that I didn't

1405
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:10,620
want to skin the cat. I wanted to be, I wanted to be a statue. I wanted the freaking Hammer

1406
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:15,100
Brothers suit. I wanted to save the princess. You know, that's because we were six, seven,

1407
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:19,340
whatever age when this game came out. I wanted to throw hammers at people. PETA, you're being dumb.

1408
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:24,540
I wanted to throw hammers at people. So yeah, no, seriously. That was my point. Yeah. Well,

1409
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:31,100
I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once, but, but I mean, now this could still

1410
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:36,380
happen. We could still make that dream come true. By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point

1411
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:41,420
that I would like to, um, to bring up to our listeners of voting age. Sure. And then I want

1412
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:47,900
to go to the chat room. Okay. Um, the people with power are trying to make these decisions for us

1413
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:56,860
and your, basically every time that you say, fuck it. Every time you say, I don't, I can't make a

1414
02:03:56,860 --> 02:04:08,220
difference or I don't feel like it. Every time you display, um, apathy, you're basically saying,

1415
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:14,380
do whatever you want to. I don't care. That means the shit that's going on in the world right now,

1416
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:20,700
right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault because you didn't

1417
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:25,580
vote for the people who need to make, who need to be the ones to make the change. You get enough

1418
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:30,540
people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their

1419
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:35,020
money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.

1420
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:42,220
We'll see change then. Very serious point and very much needed. And I think everybody better

1421
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:46,140
make sure they vote or you can't complain about these like things like SOPA and things like that

1422
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:49,660
because you elected these people. My third catch phrase then, because you know, my first one is

1423
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:53,500
welcome to the fantasy zone and get ready. The system is only as good as the games that are on

1424
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:57,580
it. And number three change doesn't happen until you make it happen. Well, I thought it was going

1425
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:02,300
to be reject false icons, but that works. I stole from gorillas. All right. Fair enough. Um, I want

1426
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:05,980
to technically, I stole the first one from space Harrier. Let me go to some lols from our chat room

1427
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:09,900
because the chat room is bringing the lols and it's talking about Tanuki Mario. Uh, Kaijuto in

1428
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:14,700
chat says I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario. Uh, DDR dollar bill says the only

1429
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:20,060
time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned. Um, let's see. Um, Tiger claw in our

1430
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,540
chat says these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.

1431
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:31,420
Um, and also says PETA never complained about angry birds, a game where you slingshot birds

1432
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:39,820
into buildings. All I have to say, wait. Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote,

1433
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:46,620
including my husband. Well, unless you're, you know, 17. Well, if you're a voting age,

1434
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:55,180
and if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house and then you mail it back in.

1435
02:05:55,180 --> 02:06:02,540
You know what that requires? Walking to the mailbox. All right. Act F says, sadly,

1436
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:07,980
I don't live in the US. Well, I meant for people who live here, people who can vote,

1437
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:11,500
people who have the, in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote,

1438
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:17,420
your votes matter in your country, in your community, you make the difference in your own

1439
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:22,860
damn community. Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life. The end. All right.

1440
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:28,780
I think Dark Sakura is ready for the FUs of the week, or maybe she already did it. Let's use it

1441
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:54,460
anyway. My FU goes to bones006 today. Um, who, uh, can't spell. What has an H in it. The word is

1442
02:06:54,460 --> 02:07:01,900
about, about, B-O-U-T is like a battle or a match. People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E,

1443
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:05,500
can't has an apostrophe in it and appeared. You are part of what is wrong with the country

1444
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:13,500
and everybody else fucking vote. All right. Okay. Um, oh boy.

1445
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:19,340
I guess I'd just say, uh, F-U-2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.

1446
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:28,060
There's only so much time in the day. Uh, my FU of the week just goes to like being like

1447
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:33,740
really, really busy and just, there is so much going on right now. And like, you know,

1448
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:37,340
like somebody said to me last night, like, oh, boo, boo, you have the biggest problem that you

1449
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:43,020
have too much on your social calendar to do, but I just, it can be exhausting and just, you know,

1450
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:46,780
sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't

1451
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:52,860
want to piss people off. It's just, uh, it's just rough. So F-U all that.

1452
02:07:54,460 --> 02:08:01,020
The holidays are about loving, damn it. I actually do have a little tiny one.

1453
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:08,540
All right. People, um, F-U to everybody who says that Christmas isn't, is becoming less Christian

1454
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:16,220
because it wasn't Christian to begin with. It was very, very, very, very pagan. The end.

1455
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:20,220
Can't we all just get along? Oh, come on. It was about burning trees.

1456
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:25,340
How is that not pagan? Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?

1457
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:29,260
No, cause fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth. No, but he could make water into wine.

1458
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:36,940
He also wasn't, nevermind. Oh, so I have to, I have to say this. My mom, my mom tried to have

1459
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:40,060
this argument with me and you were there for that. That's where the gay pie party came from.

1460
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:44,860
She says, well, what would, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?

1461
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:53,580
Um, Hanukkah was always Jewish. Um, yeah, that made no sense, mom.

1462
02:08:54,140 --> 02:09:00,380
Well, also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah. No, it's actually a menorah is a Hebrew word for

1463
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:07,500
a candelabra. The technical term is a Hanukiah. So it is. How about some rapid fire gaming news?

1464
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:12,780
Loki, you have a lot of news to talk to us about. We're going to quickly go through some stories.

1465
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:19,180
Let's talk about Rhythm Heaven. It's coming to, uh, the Wii in the North America in February,

1466
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:25,660
uh, Rhythm Heaven Fever. And, um, this was announced via Nintendo Power. So I would say

1467
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:33,820
that's pretty legitimate. And, um, I hate the game to be honest. I played it on the DS, did not care

1468
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:38,140
for Rhythm Heaven. Just not my thing. Some people are really into it though. Yeah. If you like

1469
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:43,340
rhythm, I haven't played it enough. You like rhythm games and, um, by all means, uh, go ahead and check

1470
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:49,420
it out. Of course, there was supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow

1471
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:56,620
you to shoot some 3D video. Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time. It is scheduled though for

1472
02:09:56,620 --> 02:10:02,940
this week on December 8th. So you can look forward to that. And of course that will give you, uh, the

1473
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:09,980
3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service

1474
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:17,980
and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on. So more Mario

1475
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:25,580
Kart tracks we can only hope. Um, Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight. It is going

1476
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:33,500
to be a brand new, um, Microsoft Flight sim. And, uh, of course, they haven't really unveiled too

1477
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:38,700
many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that

1478
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:46,780
series. It's definitely popular. So, yeah, it'd be cool. And then of course, um, last but not least,

1479
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:52,060
um, or actually this isn't even close to last year. I kind of thought that they already had something

1480
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:58,780
like this, but it's still neat to see anyways. There's a new device out called the Supaboy. And

1481
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:04,780
what the Supaboy does is allows you to play, uh, Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo

1482
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:11,020
cartridges, on the go. It's one of those devices that you can play, um, it's like a handheld system

1483
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,820
and also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make

1484
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:23,580
like a mini console of sorts. And so that's available for purchase as well. And, uh, actually,

1485
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:29,340
I believe it's on Amazon. Let's see what this thing goes for here. Uh, 80 bucks. That's almost

1486
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:34,300
cheaper. I think the buying Super Nintendo, but if you want to play, you know, something portable

1487
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:41,740
without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go. That's the way to go about

1488
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:50,140
it. Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched

1489
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:58,380
Tetris on the iOS, uh, system or platform if you will, but there is a little issue with it. Um,

1490
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:07,100
it's $30 a year and, um, you can basically, uh, thanks Apple for opening up the subscription

1491
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:11,660
thing to everybody. Really appreciate that. Cause EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?

1492
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:17,020
Um, it does have some new features including, uh, galaxy mode and marathon one touch mode,

1493
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:23,820
whatever that means. And also, um, it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay.

1494
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:30,540
And of course, um, you can subscribe to the Teak Club, which offers exclusive access to new mobile

1495
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:40,540
challenges. Um, you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you could drop $30 for a full year.

1496
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:48,780
And of course the game costs you money anyways. It's 99 cents. I'll pass. Thank you very much.

1497
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:56,060
Ditto. And then of course, uh, last but not least Lego Batman 2, um, it's going to be coming out

1498
02:12:56,060 --> 02:13:01,020
at some point. And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other

1499
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:06,300
superheroes involved with it as well. Not just Batman. In fact, there's a little teaser showing,

1500
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:12,460
um, Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as, um, you know,

1501
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:18,620
some other characters. So, uh, Batman, Lego Batman 2 super DC superheroes will be the new title,

1502
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:24,780
I believe. And, uh, that'd be kind of neat. And also they're saying that they're expecting

1503
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:32,620
that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well. Looks cool. It's going to be hard

1504
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:36,300
to compete with Arkham City though, even when you're Legos. Well, I understand that. And the Lego

1505
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:44,060
games are pretty fun. Lego Batman wasn't bad. So, um, it'll be cool. All right. Um, another game is

1506
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:48,780
going free to play. Another MMO has announced that they're going free to play, which usually means

1507
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:55,020
it just didn't work with the subscription model. Um, EverQuest 2 is now gone for going free to

1508
02:13:55,020 --> 02:14:00,380
play, but here's the weird thing. Okay. EverQuest 2 kind of did a free to play thing already last

1509
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:06,620
year. It was a browser based game called EverQuest 2 extended, but the rest of the game is now going

1510
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:12,140
free to play on December 6th. Um, the offerings of, um, ever, excuse me, I'm going to sneeze in

1511
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:17,740
a minute. Bless you. Oh, rude. My body faked me out. Have you ever had that happen? It's like,

1512
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:23,740
I'm going to sneeze. I'm going to sneeze psych. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Great radio. Uh,

1513
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:29,420
EverQuest 2 extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2 and there will be

1514
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:35,980
free. There will be silver and there will be gold free members get just a little bit silver members,

1515
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:41,820
which paid $5 or 500, uh, space bucks station point things per month. They get a little more.

1516
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:46,060
And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole 15 a month. Well, you get everything.

1517
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:51,260
So there you go. EverQuest 2, you can now check out. I wonder if it'll get the same reception that,

1518
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:57,420
um, uh, DC universe did. I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff

1519
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:02,140
in it. You know, EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed

1520
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:05,260
that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1. So people didn't want to leave

1521
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:12,060
EverQuest 1, which is still going, still going dark soccer. What do you got for us?

1522
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:18,860
Well, I have a little something for us, and that is something about a game that people have been

1523
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:22,620
waiting for, except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting

1524
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:30,460
for. It's, um, Kid Icarus, but it's the 3D classics. Kid Icarus is going to be given away for

1525
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:41,340
free when, um, it launches on January 5th. And that's, um, you have to register two eligible

1526
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:49,500
3DS titles online this Christmas. So that's kind of janky, but all right, whatever. It's a club

1527
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:54,860
Nintendo thing. So you'd get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes

1528
02:15:54,860 --> 02:16:03,180
out next year. But where's the fun? Ugh. People. All right. But I mean, for the people that are

1529
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:07,580
getting Mario Land 3D or whatever, and I guess I shouldn't say jank because, you know, free,

1530
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:13,420
free is free. So, uh, and a lot of people are getting the Mario 3D Land and the Mario Kart 7,

1531
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:16,780
so it's going to make sense that there'll be a lot of people that are getting this. I totally

1532
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:23,020
won a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama. There you go. All right. Well,

1533
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:26,380
believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight. So we're going

1534
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:32,140
to actually open up the Skype line. It is open now 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is

1535
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:35,980
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call. There's a little bit of a delay tonight. So before

1536
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:40,380
I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be

1537
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:43,820
a few more in a minute here. We'll see. Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you

1538
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:47,260
want to talk about, Loki, with, um, last minute stories before we get to the Twitters? Yeah,

1539
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:52,940
let's talk about, uh, how the Vita will not support simultaneous, uh, web browsing and game

1540
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:58,300
play. Can only do one or the other at the time. And, uh... Is that really that big of a deal,

1541
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:01,340
though? Nah, I don't think so. I don't think so either. I mean, I know a lot of people are making

1542
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:03,980
a big deal out of it, but I don't, I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like,

1543
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:10,780
what system now lets you do that? Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that. Hello. But, you know,

1544
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:17,820
I, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so. Yeah, um, also, of course,

1545
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:23,580
there's, uh, that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be

1546
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:29,420
discounted 40%. I don't know where that's, it's, apparently you said that a recent Vita event

1547
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:37,900
is where they announced that. In my pants. I, I don't think so. I don't know. Even if they are,

1548
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:42,940
that's still too damn much for those random cards. Yeah, and that's great. That, that's promoting

1549
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:46,780
that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what? I wouldn't do that anyways,

1550
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:51,180
because, guess what? I get tired of my games after a while, and I wanna sell them used.

1551
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:58,300
So, meh. What's gonna be awesome is if they figure out a way to erase the game cards and

1552
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:04,620
use them as memory cards. You buy, like, a cheap ass $10 game and it's like, hey,

1553
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:07,980
I'm gonna erase this shit. That's what I think's gonna ultimately happen. I think the hackers are

1554
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:13,020
gonna find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards. I, I could see that happening,

1555
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:19,740
absolutely. Again, our Skype line 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1556
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:27,900
Anything else? Um. I like fire. There was another, another, uh, story commenting on the whole FIFA

1557
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:33,420
fishing thing. Apparently EA has put up some stuff on their website about how to spot fishing sites.

1558
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:37,020
And they're still insisting that it's not a security breach, but yeah.

1559
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:42,220
Yeah, there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name. I'm so sorry,

1560
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:46,620
but the guy was writing about how he got hacked. And it's like kind of one of those things was

1561
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:51,580
like, I just, I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked, to finally kind

1562
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:55,020
of put it out there where it's like, well, wait a minute. I didn't get fished. And he even says

1563
02:18:55,020 --> 02:19:00,940
this in the story. Like, I don't think I got fished. You know, I'm, I'm not happy this is

1564
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:06,140
happening to people, but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites. So let me

1565
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:08,860
go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic. Remind me to come back to this.

1566
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:12,940
Okay. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma

1567
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:18,300
Sautome. Hey. Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy? Not much. A couple of things. I just got home,

1568
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:24,780
so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds Cookbook. No, I didn't. The Angry Birds Cookbook.

1569
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:32,380
Good God. Can this game get any more saturated? It's a cash cow. What can I tell you? Yeah, right.

1570
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:38,860
So what is in the Angry Birds Cookbook? What will I learn how to cook? Birds? Actually, I don't know.

1571
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:42,540
I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to

1572
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:51,020
read into it. What's that? I'm sorry. Dark Cyrus phone went off. I said I just saw it online on

1573
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:56,300
our friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered. Maybe it talks

1574
02:19:56,300 --> 02:20:00,860
about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.

1575
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:09,020
Or pig-themed recipes. Seriously, an Angry Birds Cookbook? Like, how? I don't know. Forget it.

1576
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:15,180
I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade. I think that's Loki's department.

1577
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:17,980
Ah, Loki's all tiraded out tonight. I don't know if you heard Part A.

1578
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:25,660
No, I was at a premiere tonight, so. That's alright. Let's just say that Xenoblade news

1579
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:33,580
just kind of one thing led to another on that department. Oh god. I can't wait to listen to

1580
02:20:33,580 --> 02:20:38,140
tonight's episode. Oh, and our website's coming back. That's the big news you missed too. We'll

1581
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:42,540
be back just depending on when DNS updates for people, so hopefully within 24 hours.

1582
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:48,300
Wonderful. Yep. But, um, the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.

1583
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:54,620
A game review? Alright. What do you want to review? Voltron, Defender of the Universe

1584
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:59,340
for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Wha-wha-wha? Oh, you didn't-

1585
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:04,940
No. You didn't know? No. Yes, it came out Wednesday. I'm in school. I have no life.

1586
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:09,180
She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft. But anyway,

1587
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:12,940
uh, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.

1588
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:18,860
Long and short of it, you are control of any of the five lions and is up to you to protect

1589
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:25,500
the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat on Lotor. Is it like a tower defense game?

1590
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:32,060
Actually, no. The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars. Oh, that's kind of cool. I like

1591
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:39,900
Geometry Wars. Now, take your typical treasure shooter. It's like that. You're pretty much

1592
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:46,700
running around the plains just blasting everything with the- that you can- that the lasers can see.

1593
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:50,540
Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up Dark Sakura's alley.

1594
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:57,340
It's a cave shooter or treasure shooter mixed with- Want. Want. You should go download the demo

1595
02:21:57,340 --> 02:22:03,420
on Xbox. I think I will. Uh, Uchon, one more thing. Yes. If you like- if you like it,

1596
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:07,900
depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.

1597
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:14,540
Aww, what a nice boy. Aww, okay. That's the best part about doing this show. Once in a while,

1598
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:22,380
free shit. Heck yeah. Thank you. Love you, Rama. Love you, Mina. So on a scale of, um,

1599
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:28,140
one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?

1600
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:33,820
Seven. That's a pretty good review. So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger? Hell yeah.

1601
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:37,500
Now, what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?

1602
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:45,820
Your butt's for babies. As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate. Hey, Rama, do you know what I

1603
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:53,500
actually just watched all of last week? What? Go Lion. I have all of it and I watched all of it.

1604
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:58,220
By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Bro is called Hate is Gonna Hate.

1605
02:22:58,220 --> 02:23:01,580
I heard about that. I saw somebody get that on Twitter. And, and Rama,

1606
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:08,140
this is such a great story. You're going to hate it, but I don't care. Okay. So I thought

1607
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:14,620
of you this week. Yeah. Okay. I was watching Wendy Williams. That's a man. I just want you to know

1608
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:22,380
that's a man. Okay. But you know, I love Wendy Williams. Okay. How you doing? And she was talking

1609
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:26,860
about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something. And at the end of it, she said,

1610
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:33,260
and I kid you not, she said, stay black. And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?

1611
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:39,580
Cause I thought that joke started here. Uh, wait, wait, wait, Rob, stop. You said you like

1612
02:23:39,580 --> 02:23:44,940
Wendy Williams? Haters gonna hate. 50 points from Gryffindor.

1613
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:51,580
All right. Look, I'm trying, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of

1614
02:23:51,580 --> 02:23:55,980
listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them. In this case,

1615
02:23:55,980 --> 02:24:00,620
somebody say stay black. Cause that all started with you here on the show, you know.

1616
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:07,740
It didn't actually, it's not just, uh, related to, it's, it's a phrase that's been out for a

1617
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:12,860
long time. I know that, but I'm just saying, I heard it in mainstream press this week and it

1618
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:19,020
made me think of our Rama. Stay black. Dan didn't bring me any high, I'm mad at him.

1619
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:23,260
All right, Rama, we're gonna let you go to get more calls, but, um, go back to Voltron,

1620
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:28,620
have fun. Will do. And of course, stay black. And you stay fabulous. I will. Oh, I will girl.

1621
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:35,740
All right. Bye. One eight seven seven game O L R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

1622
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:40,700
Cause you don't chat. So stay black is an old saying. I know that. Gosh, I'm just being silly.

1623
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:48,140
All right. Orange lounge radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. O L R.

1624
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:50,940
How about some tweets in the meantime?

1625
02:24:54,460 --> 02:25:00,540
O L R fan forever. Hey, I like that name. That's a great Twitter name. O L R fan forever. And it's,

1626
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:05,740
it's, it's like, it's not my mom or something. Like it's an actual person. O L R fan forever

1627
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:11,660
asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester? Was dark Sakura eliminated?

1628
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:17,660
Actually, I believe dark Sakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention.

1629
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:24,140
Correct? I just didn't bother promoting it. You just kind of after, I mean, that night it was

1630
02:25:24,140 --> 02:25:28,940
funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that? And

1631
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:35,660
it was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland on the negative side. I would be

1632
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:43,820
whoring myself out to Sony. I am no one's whore. Let's go to the phones higher on orange launch

1633
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:55,500
radio. Who's this solid train pulling up to the station. By the way, can I just say though the,

1634
02:25:55,500 --> 02:26:01,420
I'm assuming this is your kid on the user pic. Adorable. Isn't she fresh and clean.

1635
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:07,900
Absolutely adorable. Look at her little hoodie on it. I know it's precious. I love it. All right.

1636
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:11,660
Sorry to derail. Try sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said,

1637
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:16,620
what's on your mind, buddy? Jim Sally train's coming in today. We got to have some discussions

1638
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:23,340
people. Okay. First off, we need to talk about evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers

1639
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:30,540
issues with these game cards expiring. It's not, we really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their

1640
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:35,980
game cards expire. It's evil G's fault. You know, if I went to the grocery store to buy some milk

1641
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:40,140
and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer. I'd yell at the store that sold me

1642
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:44,780
the expired milk. I think EB games should be taking these games off their shelves. Shouldn't

1643
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:50,220
be EA's fault. You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it. I have to admit,

1644
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:55,420
I didn't really think about it like that. I mean, I don't know. I kind of, I get what you're saying.

1645
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:59,020
I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I'm kind of like, I feel like they

1646
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,620
didn't really think about this. I don't think they informed the stores either. They have this problem.

1647
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,380
And I kind of think the stores don't know either. I think people just told evil G,

1648
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:10,860
the evil, you know, evil G is they would just pretend like they didn't know sell it to you

1649
02:27:10,860 --> 02:27:15,740
anyway. I don't care, but they're so they're all in cahoots. I don't think they're in cahoots. I

1650
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:21,420
think evil G is just doing it anyway. Like EA probably told evil G, yo, give us those games

1651
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:25,900
back if you don't sell them. Evil G is like, whatever, we can sell anything. I would honestly

1652
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:30,300
think though that evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe

1653
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:36,060
like an independent Ma and Pa shop who, you know, only rarely gets a lot of people to come through

1654
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:40,620
there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time.

1655
02:27:40,620 --> 02:27:44,460
Because the Ma and Pa retailer is losing out to places like evil G. They're getting these

1656
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:49,020
exclusives and so forth. I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their

1657
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:54,140
shelf. And I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't

1658
02:27:54,140 --> 02:28:01,180
control that no one wants the goddamn game. I don't know. Well, either way, in EA's fault,

1659
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:04,540
how long are you supposed to keep these codes active for? And it's a service. There's no

1660
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:09,740
monetary value to it. Right? It's a service. It's not like a gift card. A gift card is an

1661
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:15,580
account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency. I realize the gift

1662
02:28:15,580 --> 02:28:21,980
card thing is a stretch. It is a service being provided later. It is a little bit like you can't,

1663
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,660
it's not apples to apples comparison. But my point with that was that it's still,

1664
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:34,300
it would be $10 to replace that pass. So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly

1665
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:44,860
you're losing. Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have

1666
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:50,700
dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year. And

1667
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:54,380
here's the other thing too. Look at Blizzard games. If they're saying that, oh, by the way,

1668
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:59,340
you know, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st. Okay,

1669
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:04,220
well then I'm gonna buy used. Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive

1670
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:08,700
to do so? That's not the way to do it. Really? It's not the way to do it? We shouldn't punish

1671
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:14,860
the publishers for doing this type of bullshit? Yeah. How are we supposed to keep the stuff open

1672
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:19,980
for it? I don't even think it's a punishment thing. It's just a, any shoppers gonna find the

1673
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:27,980
best value they can. Yeah, man. It's up to you. When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up to the

1674
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:33,100
dealership down the street, you shop around a little bit before you buy it. You have to

1675
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:36,780
educate yourself a little bit before you buy it. Yeah, and play the game with people. Everyone's

1676
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:42,460
got a different deal. But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because

1677
02:29:42,460 --> 02:29:48,380
they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that. If there's nothing there that, you

1678
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:52,620
know, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game, you know, and someone

1679
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:59,260
hasn't played this copy of the game, then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new,

1680
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:03,420
I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap. Now going back to

1681
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:09,260
the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore because they

1682
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:13,420
know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day? EA has already made their

1683
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:16,860
money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf. They don't care at this point if the game is sold

1684
02:30:16,860 --> 02:30:20,140
new or used because they already sold the game. They're probably not buying new copies of that

1685
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:23,820
game anyways because they probably have like a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyways.

1686
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:29,340
And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, you know, say I want to buy

1687
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:32,460
a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that. Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies

1688
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:37,420
that are used, you know, that are in good, you know, good quality that you can get for, you know,

1689
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:41,980
five, ten dollars cheaper or whatever. And most people will be like, okay, sure, I'll do that.

1690
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:46,460
Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that. But, you know, you can probably guess

1691
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:54,780
that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run

1692
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:58,620
of Mass Effect 2. Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, or, well, not Game of

1693
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:01,980
the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.

1694
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:05,740
That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.

1695
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:12,780
I mean, I don't know. I haven't really looked at it, but they may have. All right. Well, Jim Sally,

1696
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:16,060
I gotta wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets. Do you have any

1697
02:31:16,060 --> 02:31:20,140
any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter? South Park Game is

1698
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:23,340
going to be a great game of Obsidian. They're the best developers ever in the world of Obsidian.

1699
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:28,380
Thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 and Vegas and Knights of the

1700
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:34,860
Republic 2. I love you everybody, and don't forget, if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed,

1701
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:42,540
you're picking it too much or not enough. Thank you for that sage advice, Jim Sally.

1702
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:47,580
Appreciate it. I have high hopes for the South Park Game too, I will say, so I hope they don't

1703
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:52,540
let me down. Back to the Twitters. 1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio. We can

1704
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:56,540
probably squeeze in like one more call. Dark Tetsuya tweeted us and said, hey,

1705
02:31:56,540 --> 02:32:01,740
OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One. I don't think I've ever loved

1706
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:05,180
a book this much. P.S. Fuck the Sixers. I'm assuming that's something from the book.

1707
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:10,860
Tigerclaw sends us a few stories that slip through the cracks otherwise.

1708
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:16,220
Some layoffs at Day One Studios because they lost a Konami publishing deal.

1709
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:22,300
Tigerclaw links us to an article on Gamasutra via the Twitter saying that Day One Studios,

1710
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:29,660
who developed F.E.A.R. 3 and Mech Assault, they laid off 95%. That's an entire development team

1711
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:35,660
because they lost a publishing deal with Konami. Apparently, they were working on a reboot of

1712
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:43,660
Silent Scope. Interesting, but I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they

1713
02:32:43,660 --> 02:32:51,260
pulled it. Yeah, Silent Scope is kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go, maybe with all

1714
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:55,820
the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off. Maybe. Well, they didn't have

1715
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:59,980
to do it that way. I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now. They have Sniper

1716
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:08,220
Elite and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior, something like that, that was actually pretty well

1717
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:13,740
liked and they have sequels coming out. I mean, there's not a lot of sniper games, but I think

1718
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:18,780
something like Silent Scope would have stood out. I would have guessed that they were working on,

1719
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:22,940
was it that, I don't remember the fuck the series is called now, the one that was on the PSP and

1720
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:26,860
then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3. It was like a sci-fi shooter or something

1721
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:32,860
like that. I don't remember. That's how wonderful that game was. But there was, it was supposed to

1722
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:37,340
be like a launch title for the PS3, but I guess I would have been a little late. All right, let me

1723
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:41,900
go to the phones. We got one more call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is

1724
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:48,300
Kokomo. I just have a question. When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1,

1725
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:55,020
2, and 3? That's a lot of Mass Effect. I got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I

1726
02:33:55,020 --> 02:34:00,780
really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me. But here's the

1727
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:05,020
thing. What I really like about what they're doing in Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea. I mean,

1728
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:08,700
I guess this is from that demo that leaked out before and all that. Remember how they had the

1729
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:14,620
demo up early? Is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode

1730
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:19,180
that focuses more on the battle. It's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end

1731
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:23,980
of the game you like more. And the RPG mode to me sounds really, really interesting because I do

1732
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:28,540
think BioWare can tell some good stories. But as far as like, do I have enough time to freaking

1733
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:35,740
play Mass Effect 1 and 2? Probably not. But if Mass Effect 2, or if they do with 3, what they

1734
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:40,700
do with 2, didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect

1735
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:47,580
1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game? Sort of, yeah. On the PS3, they did.

1736
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:51,980
So maybe there'll be something like that. So at least the rest of us can get caught up.

1737
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:54,860
What's your opinion on it? Are you a Mass Effect fan?

1738
02:34:56,140 --> 02:35:00,300
I really do enjoy Mass Effect. I mean, I'm probably going to have to take like a whole

1739
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:07,900
like week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3. I mean, then you have like all the different

1740
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:13,500
things like you can be evil. And then that's another play around. It's just so much time.

1741
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:19,660
This is the way of BioWare though. Like right now, Alan has been playing a lot of Dragon Age.

1742
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:24,220
Like he just randomly like this month decided to start playing this game from 2009, but I've

1743
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:28,780
watched him play through it once. It's kind of like a goody two shoes. Once it's a villain,

1744
02:35:28,780 --> 02:35:32,540
now he's working on the expansion. It's kind of like he got two completely different types of

1745
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:36,780
games based on how he was playing the story. And this is one thing that BioWare is like really

1746
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:41,740
good at. And it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about The Old Republic because

1747
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:47,740
Lover hates Star Wars. They're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect style storytelling in Dragon Age

1748
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:54,220
into an MMO. And for some people, that's very, very exciting. Absolutely. All right. That's all

1749
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:58,620
my questions. You guys have a great night. That's all right. Thank you for your station. All right.

1750
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:02,780
Well, thank you so much. Have a great night and try not to lose too much sleep when the game

1751
02:36:02,780 --> 02:36:08,140
comes out. Okay. I won't. All right. Later. I know a lot of people are very excited about

1752
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:12,540
Mass Effect 3. You know, it's just one of those series where it's like, if there were more hours

1753
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:17,900
in the day, I probably would have gotten into Mass Effect, but I just, you can't play everything,

1754
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:25,340
especially when you have a day job. All right. TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here.

1755
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:30,940
And that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking

1756
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:39,820
deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to a story at 1UP.com, where apparently the Digital Millennium

1757
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:46,860
Copyright Act, the DMCA, a few exemptions were granted about a year ago, which had to do with

1758
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:52,620
the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use. Now the EFF is saying,

1759
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:56,620
shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well? If you want to mod your video

1760
02:36:56,620 --> 02:37:01,660
game consoles, what do you think? I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if

1761
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:05,740
you can jailbreak your phone, why can't you jailbreak your video game console? Loki, I'm

1762
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:10,940
sure you're all for this. Well, just because it's legal to do that doesn't mean that it's

1763
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:15,500
necessarily going to be any different than it is now, because basically they'll still ban your

1764
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:21,340
console or whatever if you try to go online. All it means is that you can't have anything like,

1765
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:26,300
you know, Sony coming after Geohot or something like that. They won't have that. And I was going

1766
02:37:26,300 --> 02:37:34,220
to say, is it really illegal to do that right now? Technically, I mean, sort of it is. I mean,

1767
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:38,540
but they're just not going to come after the user, especially now that they have, in fact,

1768
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:45,260
ironically enough, I'm looking at some right now about reset glitch hacking on. Well, you can do

1769
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:51,900
it on any Xbox 360, regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now. And looking at slim

1770
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:57,980
body and stuff like that. Just curious to see what's required for that stuff. Interesting.

1771
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:03,500
You know, I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem. It's that they don't

1772
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:10,460
want you playing pirated games on it for one and, you know, using exploits and all that stuff as

1773
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:14,140
well. So that's why, you know, usually these companies will kick you off the network if they,

1774
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:17,900
which they can do because it's their network. Exactly. But, you know, like for instance,

1775
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:21,100
didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation threes because they were super computers?

1776
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:26,700
They probably never upgraded them or, you know, who knows, maybe they even found a work around

1777
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:29,740
so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.

1778
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:33,500
I don't think those things even, I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation network. They're

1779
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:41,340
just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter. All right. Well, that's going to do it for the

1780
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:45,100
Twitter topics tonight. And that's also going to do it for the Skype line. Big apologies to those

1781
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:48,940
didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us

1782
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:54,060
tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+. We'll take your comments there too.

1783
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:58,780
We can read some of those on the show, but for now, that's it. We're wrapping up. We're getting

1784
02:38:58,780 --> 02:39:01,740
out of here. You were done with last minute stories, right? Loki, do we finish everything?

1785
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:07,020
Okay. Um, I didn't have anything. I figured because you would have spoke up if you did.

1786
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:12,700
Hey. Hey. So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio. Um,

1787
02:39:12,700 --> 02:39:17,340
it's almost nine o'clock or midnight on the East coast. So I think it's about time to wrap up.

1788
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:21,100
Um, first off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show. Thank you for downloading

1789
02:39:21,100 --> 02:39:25,260
and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. You know, it's been kind of a poopy past couple of weeks

1790
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:29,740
with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us. Those of you that

1791
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:32,300
are listening live are still showing up and listening live. We have a lot of people in

1792
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:36,140
chat tonight. So thank you guys so much. And podcast ease, you've stuck by us and here you

1793
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:40,140
are downloading another show. So I just, I really appreciate it. Thanks for the support. Um,

1794
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:43,740
remember if you like Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money,

1795
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:46,380
although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.

1796
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:51,900
That will be an exception. Uh, but you know, here on this program, we don't ask for your money. All

1797
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:58,540
we ask help spread the word, tell somebody about the program and, uh, you know, help the OL army

1798
02:39:58,540 --> 02:40:03,180
grow. So on that note, let's go around and get her base final thoughts so we can get out of here

1799
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:07,180
tonight. Loki, I'll start with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I'm

1800
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:13,980
picking a really weird song for cage match. Awesome. Um, my final thought is now, now that

1801
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,700
Loki's lamey borrow saints road, the third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the

1802
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:25,180
character that, um, uh, Travis Donovan pass is only for playing co-op or co-op or system link.

1803
02:40:25,180 --> 02:40:29,820
Um, all right. I'm going to have to figure out how to do that. I want Travis Donovan's little, um,

1804
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:35,340
you need it. Okay. Well you need to create a profile on the saints row website. Once you do

1805
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:41,500
that, you go browse to his character and you click it to you add it to as like a book market

1806
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:45,500
or something like that. And you go into your game and you log in with your account from the saints

1807
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:51,740
row website and then you can download it. I can do that. Yes. Awesome. All right. And a dark soccer,

1808
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:56,380
your final thought. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the difference of one day

1809
02:40:56,380 --> 02:41:02,540
makes a hundred dollar price difference in plane to plane fare. Yes. And that was from a Tuesday

1810
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:06,940
to a Wednesday. Oh, I was going to say Thursday to Friday or something on the weekend I get,

1811
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:13,420
but that's boy, airline fees are interesting. That's uh, yeah, exactly a hundred dollars.

1812
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:18,380
Wow. All right. Well thank you guys, uh, again for tuning in and downloading the show and one

1813
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:24,380
more time. Awesome event happening this Thursday, December 8th, six 30 Pacific nine 30 Eastern

1814
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:29,020

1815
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:33,580
Francisco Bay area, you better be at the DNA lounge. Bring 10 bucks, bring a little more

1816
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:38,300
