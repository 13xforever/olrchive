Tonight, December 18, 2011, Square Enix experiences a hack, Nintendo offers free games for loyalty points, and the PlayStation Vita appears to abandon the instruction manual.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live with the 439th episode of our show on this December the 18th of 2011.
We're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gamer culture, gamer lifestyle, and so forth with my co-host, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
You're like that video of Rick Perry where they replaced him with a butt.
That one was great.
How are you?
I'm okay.
It's been a long day.
It's been a long day.
Been packing up stuff.
Been...
Prepare to abandon ship
Mario Kart Break Time!
and talk with us there.
All right.
In fact, Jim Sally is in our chat room tonight starting us off talking about the intro to the show saying, Jim Sally, OLR's intro is great.
It always pumps me up.
It is a great little song.
That was by MidiHead.
If you don't know who did our intro, his name is MidiHead.
He did some of the songs in DDR Beatmania kind of like around when the original Xbox versions were big.
He's a great guy.
We had him on the show.
and then Jim Sally says, then Rob's soothing voice brings me down and I get all snuggly in bed.
I'm not sure how to take that, but all right, sure.
Whatever floats your boat.
Whatever gets you to listen live with us.
Anyhow, so usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week?
So I think we'll get into that and then we'll come back to the housekeeping thing we want to talk about.
So let's talk about our gaming weeks.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I played shit.
Okay.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I played some P.O.P.O.
and I think Dan played some Metroid Fusion but I mean we're just you know bopping through a few games here and there.
It's like Game Boy Advance made a comeback this week between that and the 3DS news which I know is coming up later but everybody knows those games came out so.
Also we actually put the Saturn up because we're tired of Christmas nights.
Oh well.
Christmas is cancelled.
I don't care to play this anymore.
No other holiday games to get you in the mood?
No.
You don't want to dance to Silent Hill in the DR?
Wow, Winter Veil?
I've been doing this stupid Winter Veil shit.
No, finally, thank you Shane for making me an orc DK so I can throw snowflakes at you.
I don't even know if he's listening if you're listening, if you're not there's Rick Perry again he made a draenei priest for me to throw snowflakes at named For Jamie I think when I and just so people know there's certain achievements in WoW where you have to find characters around the holidays for instance the Easter one or whatever they call Easter in WoW, I can't remember Noble Garden Noble Garden, that's it
you have to find female characters of each race level 18 or over and it's called Shake Your Bunny Maker and you have to turn them into bunnies and they have to be level 18 or older I can tell you this because I'm a female dwarf which is like a freaking unicorn in WoW and I can't tell you how much I get turned into a freaking bunny when that holiday comes around
Freaking goats are easy to find.
So I made a rogue for whatever the last holiday was.
You had to do something with a blood elf rogue.
I don't remember why I did it, but I did.
And I named it Oops, I Pooped.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember that one.
You made it for me to find.
Because I still haven't deleted it.
I thought you had a troll.
I did, but I deleted the troll so I could make the rogue.
No, that's right, because I had to go run to you.
Yeah.
Stupid silver moon.
But yeah, so I've actually been playing Peggle in WoW 2 now that it works again.
Nice.
But right now the thing that I'm trying to get is I have to kill 10 more people while dressed as a gnome in a Santa costume.
Oh yeah.
I don't like how it kind of forces you to do PvP if you want to get all the achievements.
I know.
And then like you get killed and you lose the disguise.
All I have to say, when that stupid kids holiday comes up, you are going to want to kill something.
I mean it's just.
Actually, I want to do BB King.
That's not too bad.
BB King is where you go to the major horde cities and you have to shoot the leaders with a BB gun.
Like I'm going to go shoot Sylvanas in the ass or something.
Anyway, should I save the WoW talk for the other show?
HordeHouse.com We'll have you back on.
We might.
Episode 50 is coming up very soon.
When?
I just have to convince Extifer we should tape more often than every other week, but that's another story.
Well, I also got some games on Steam because I got the Humble Indie Bundle thanks to Rob, and I started Cave Story.
And then Dan's like, I was like, I'm kind of tired of playing because we've had a busy day.
Dan's like, uh-uh, play more.
So he's watching me play Cave Story.
That doesn't usually happen.
Usually you're watching him play stuff, so that's cool.
Okay, check out this elder thing, Rob.
Nice.
It's like an old school gamepad.
My old controller.
You should put a picture of that on OLR.com.
I might.
It's actually not the one that I used when I played.
What brand is that?
It's a Gravis.
Gravis, ah, yeah.
It's not the one that I used when I played Final Fantasy XI.
This is the older one.
That kind of to me looks like what the PlayStation 3 controller was going to look like.
It kind of has that boomerang thing going on a little bit.
Just a little bit.
It's not quite as tacky as that other controller was.
It's actually fairly comfortable.
I mean, because, you know, my hand's all fucked up.
Yeah.
I'm sorry if I sound like I'm kind of high.
But you are!
No, I had half a beer.
And I've been allergies all day.
So, because of all the dust we've kicked up.
So yeah, I played Cave Story and then I got another game just randomly.
I happened to see it up on Steam and I was like, that was kind of pretty.
I'm going to get it because it's pretty.
It was a game called Fractal that you have these little hexagon shapes.
And for those who don't know their roots, hexagons are six-sided polyhedrons.
What's a polyhedron?
Your butt.
So you have to form, attach something of the same color to all sides of it and then it'll explode, but you have a push.
So say you have to push in the spaces around them and you get a certain color that you'll push with.
And like say that you're only on one side, well you only push in one side, but say that you push in the dead center of a circle of them, it'll push them all out, all in that color.
so you have to make the little all six sides of one touch and sometimes you can get multiple they're called blooms and you get point multipliers and you also get little ones that if you hit them they destroy everything around them and all this stuff but it's really hard like I'm only on the tenth stage and there's a bunch of them
and you have to get like 320 breaks done.
And like the most I can get is 240.
It's tough.
But you were telling me the music kind of adds to the game, right?
The music is very trancy.
It's very ambient trance.
And as you do better, as your score goes up in that level, it's like, for example, when you break one blossom, that's seven points.
If you get like a double, you get 14.
They call it an awesome blossom if you get a double.
Anyway, as you get more points, the music gets more complex.
But when you run out of pushes, like when you get down to like five pushes, the music starts going really slow.
And it doesn't change in pitch.
It just changes in tempo.
So, it's just like, you know, really slow.
And then you're on your last push and then it just stops.
And one thing that I really like about it is actually the type design in this game.
It's really pretty.
Of course.
Well, your levels come out on a diagonal when it gives you all your level information and your scores.
I'll try to go in and do a screen cap of a level so that I can show people what it looks like, but it's a really gorgeous game.
And when you choose your graphic settings, you have good, bad, but when you start going better, you have beautiful.
So it's pretty cool.
And it starts off asking you if you want to play it windowed.
It looked pretty from the two seconds I saw you playing it.
Yeah.
I'll...
I'll put some screencaps up.
It's like six bucks right now on Steam, so go get it.
All of you go get it so that they'll make more.
And maybe they'll make a tutorial so that it's not so freaking hard.
It's one of those games that's so hard that it pisses you off until you have to beat it.
I'm so mad I will conquer you.
You whore.
Going on to Loki.
How was your gaming week?
It was okay.
I played a lot of Skyrim.
Been exploiting the Dawnstar Hidden Khajiit treasure chest.
Actually did that for quite a bit last night.
It's very rewarding because you get a lot of loot and money and you get to kill somebody in their face over and over and over again.
I like that phrase.
Kill someone in their face.
You win the award of choice of words today.
And then, so I spent last night trying to take all the loot that I got from Dawnstar back to Winterhold.
And what else did I do?
Oh yeah, and then a little bit more in the quest of A Night to Remember, which is funny because it's like a
This big long chain of random things that you did while you were drunk one night because you blacked out and can't remember.
So that was kind of fun.
And then I got Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land for the 3DS this week.
So I played lots of Mario Kart 7.
I finished all the tracks, or all the circuits I guess, in 50cc.
And I started to play some 150cc stuff, but
Man, I mean, seriously, Nintendo, I understand you gotta ramp up the difficulty for 150cc, but the Rubber Band AI is just so retarded.
It's just ridiculous, the amount of... It's like, do I really need to be hit with, like, two blue shells, five red shells, and, you know, lightning all at the same time?
Oh, and thank you for doing lightning right as I'm jumping over a cliff.
It's like I'm playing with fucking assholes in, you know, Mario Kart 7.
I mean...
It's just, the computer's like, Ha!
Suck it, bitch!
You're over a... You're in the worst spot possible for a lightning bolt, and lightning bolt, that's what you're gonna get.
I hate that too.
They always seem to know right when you're going over a big jump and that's when they're going to hit the lightning bolt.
Or right before you get there.
That's irritating.
It's like I'm going to be way ahead of everybody and all of a sudden here comes Mario.
It's like, oh, I'm sorry.
Mario got like five superstars in Infinite Boost all at the same time.
Oh, and he's a dragon and it flies now for some reason.
But yeah, it's a fun game.
It's Mario Kart.
I mean, what do you expect?
I did like some of their choices, though, for the retro courses.
Although, like I say, my least favorite course in that game has to be probably the Neo Bowser City.
It's just such a waste.
I mean, it could have been cool, but it's just like, you know, I don't know.
It's such a waste of a course.
BlackWolf in our chatroom, of course the man, Bobby BlackWolf, who comes on before us here at All Games Radio, says Mario Kart is the original Asshole Mario.
You ever seen that mod for Super Mario World?
Asshole Mario?
That's a very good comparison.
I don't remember the AI being that bad in the original game and stuff.
I mean, One for the CC was pretty hard.
It was pretty bad.
I need a shell that kills first place
It's the ribbon.
But no, no, the lightning bolt was supposed to be your, that was in the original Mario Kart, and the lightning bolt was supposed to be the, like, fuck everybody up thing, you know, and that was like the, I am in control, I am powerful, you know, pass everybody.
Blue Shell, too much.
And I don't like that all the items aren't, I mean, it gives you better items, obviously, in the further back that you are.
Fuck that, it should be even all around.
Yeah.
Why should I be getting green shells and banana peels for being in first place?
I will say though, online, I got one of those seven power-ups that gives you just seven freaking items and bam, bam, bam, just firing them all.
That was pretty awesome and I made up a lot of space with that one and I know people didn't like me.
But here's the thing, I think that power-up sucks.
I think it's useless.
It's just like...
Are you kidding?
I fucked some people up with that.
It was awesome.
Alright.
So, yeah, Mario Kart.
It's pretty awesome.
Looking forward to playing it online.
What else?
Oh, Super Mario 3 Land.
I can't really say too much about it because I really didn't get a chance to play it much because I've been playing mostly Mario Kart.
I did try a little bit of it and I got through maybe a quarter of the first stage and the very first level and then I had to quit.
So, I mean, it looks pretty and it plays like a Mario game.
Um, I don't know, that's really all I can say right now.
I mean, it kind of reminds me a lot of, you know, Mario 64, I guess.
Um, but the setup's kind of a little bit like Mario Galaxy, but, I mean, that's it.
I mean, I'm looking forward to playing more of it.
Although, I'm looking forward to playing more Mario Kart than I am Mario 3D Land, so, eh.
And then, what else did I play?
Oh, I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 3, the 10th anniversary edition on my iPod.
And it looks nice.
But damn, I really wish there was Bluetooth support for some sort of controller because it sucks trying to control that on the... I knew the touchpad was going to be terrible for that.
Well, I mean, it's good for touch controls, I guess.
But there's not a lot you can really do with touch controls on a game like that.
I mean, they have it set up, it makes sense, but it's just...
Touch controls suck all the time for a game like that.
I mean, I even tried playing some of the Gangstar stuff before, and it just doesn't work.
But it looks nice.
I just hope that someday Apple will wise up and actually have some sort of controller that would work with some of these games.
I know that some third-party companies have done that, but obviously most of the games don't support that.
Yeah, that thing for the iPad is pretty awesome, the little arcade machine that you can put
A co-worker of mine had this awesome keyboard looking thing that the iPad plugged into the top of the flat keyboard and it made it look like a laptop that you could touch the screen on.
It was nice.
It would be kind of neat if they did something like that because it really sucks that some of these games just the touch controls are not good.
Alright, anything else?
words of friends because my wife wants me to play her and so I'm playing a little bit of that and please I've been getting invites to SimSocial I am not fucking playing the SimSocial so you can just save yourself some time and do not send me any more invites for that game
I'm over it too Alright, quickly, getting into my gaming week Not a whole lot Oh, Call of Duty Shush, you're done Not a whole lot of new stuff in my week Still more WoW, still more Saints Row the 3rd Which is fun I'm loving all the little activities in that game It is so over the top I never thought I would enjoy this game as much as I do But Loki, I hate to say it, you were right You were so right, this game is great I love it
I played one of the Tron things, like the bike thing.
It's kind of like light bike mixed with the Sonic 2 bonus level.
Let me put it this way.
It's kind of basic, but it does Tron better than the Tron PS3 game did bike racing, which was awful.
The bike racing killed that Tron game.
It was so bad.
So...
I thought it was weak, but it's still better than Yaris.
But not by much.
Let's see.
Also, some new games I've been playing.
Not really a new game, but like DarkSakura, I bought the indie bundle, and I can't stop playing Cave Story, which is like a years-old game.
It came out in a new one on the 3DS, but Cave Story Plus, to be specific, is the one that you get with the bundle if you pay more than the average.
I love it!
Like, if you haven't played this game, you should definitely, I mean, for one, this indie bundle that's out right now is amazing, and I know there's a story coming up on the show later, we'll tell you all the games that are in it, but it's just such a great cause, great deal, great games, and especially the games you're getting this time around, like what, Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner?
Yeah, you convinced me of Bit.Trip Runner.
Bit.Trip Runner is a great game too.
But Cave Story, it reminds me of an old NES game, obviously, with the graphics and the music.
The music's great, and I guess now you get the soundtracks, which is awesome.
And it kind of reminded me, I wanted to say, I don't know why, but Fushanadu, you remember that game?
it kind of reminded me of that a little bit even though it wasn't really the swords but it was kind of like that exploring the different multiple screens and kind of the music reminded me of it a little bit so yeah, Cave Story's awesome I like that game and otherwise been playing some old school Game Boy Advance games as a 3DS ambassador namely WarioWare is the one that I can't stop playing the original WarioWare was so good and I'm so glad that that's a part of the ambassador package because that alone is worth it so
Yep, that's pretty much it for my gaming week, otherwise.
So we're going to move on into some housekeeping.
Before I get into housekeeping, I want to talk quickly.
We're going to have an interview in a little bit, and it's with my friend Justin.
He's going to call in in about five minutes or so after we get through some other announcements here.
And he's going to talk to us about his Xbox hack experience.
and I know you guys have heard about mine and I came on here and I bitched about it and how I couldn't play my Xbox for 20 days and it was pretty bad and all this but like my story has got nothing on what you're about to hear Justin talk about and I thought it was important
to get it out there that this is happening because when you guys hear the hoops he's jumping through and what's going on, your jaw will be on the floor.
He's not making it up.
It's all legit.
I trust Justin.
Justin met at E3 and we hung out and stuff, so I know it's all legit and you're going to be shocked.
So we'll get to that in a little bit.
But first, some important housekeeping we wanted to cover tonight.
There will be no show next week, most important.
Our show happens to be on December 25th, which...
Heathen
Also, I said on Twitter and I said on Facebook, and I wasn't lying, we have to say goodbye tonight.
And things change.
And DarkSakura, well, do you want to tell the listeners what's going on?
I don't know how much you don't want to say.
I'm leaving.
I'm moving.
It's been coming for a while and it's finally happened.
And I know I've brought it up before, but the move is actually happening.
We had Pack Up and Be Out and so we are moving...
Down the Street.
So we're saying goodbye to the Orange Lounge Radio studio.
Yeah, this one.
Bye.
But maybe you made someone's heart skip a beat there a little bit.
I'm so awesome.
It was looking pretty scary there for a minute that you might have to move further than a block.
Dan still wants us to go to Washington, but I'm like... So this is the fifth... You will still have a Shermie at your feet.
Yes, I will.
That'll be great.
This is the fifth studio that we've taped Orange Lounge Radio in.
The first was that house that I had with Brian back in the day.
I don't think it ever came on the show, but that house was the first studio.
The second studio was when Loki and I lived together.
The third studio was when Extifer and I lived together, and that was a lot of change for the station.
That was the studio where the news came out and filmed us.
That was the studio where we switched to All Games Radio.
What's that?
They also came to your guys' place.
To yours and Loki's.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, the paper did.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.
I got a foot on there.
Fantastic.
So, let's see.
And then the... The news did come here.
The fourth studio was when I was in the house in the garage.
In the garage.
The cold.
The one that's on Justin TV.
Super hot sometimes.
The garage with no steady temperature.
And then we've been in this studio for well over a year.
It's been at least, yeah, probably almost two years.
But my house is comfortable and has a heater.
And Shermie, you've got Shermie to keep your feet warm.
So, um, and by the way, there's a, our chat's finally catching up with the buffer and everything.
Just reading, uh, some from our chat room, chat.orange.com.
Red said, you guys had me for a sec.
Uh, Bochikawa says, OMGs, I was scurred.
Uh, CatastrophicMagi says, yeah, my heart did skip a beat, Rob.
And DarthSpazinator sums it up best, damn you, DarkSakura, making us think you're leaving OLR.
Orange Rice said, oh you trolls
The office is going to be a little smaller.
I can tell you that, but we should be fine.
We also don't exactly know where Studio 6 is going to be.
We think it's going to be at DarkSakura's.
We just have to make sure it's going to work because it might come back to where I'm at.
So from an undisclosed location is where the next Orange Lounge Radio will be.
So it's going to be a whole new year, a whole new OLR.
But what an appropriate way to kick off our 10th year of radio from 2002 to 2012 with a new studio.
You know what?
I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
What's that?
Fuck you, Wells Fargo.
What's that for?
Oh, I got it.
Yeah, yeah, why we're moving.
You know what?
Honestly, it's not even... It's a case of overextension combined with the housing market drop is what facilitated our situation.
But man, I tell you, apartments are freaking expensive.
Yeah.
and then like we got a house for what apartment rent for a smaller place would have been so it's really expensive where Dan works too but I mean so right now though and we got a good landlord who is really gonna work with us so and honestly we found his house called him the next day two days later we're in nice
So yeah, it worked out really well.
I'm sure people who followed me on my Facebook knew about the drama.
TigerClaw on chat says, I guess the studio where you and Travis did the shows was studio number one.
I didn't count that one because we didn't do Orange Lounge Radio from there.
That was Under Sedation Live, a different show.
And besides, he didn't really call that studio one.
I believe that was what, the Masturbation Station?
The Masturbation Center.
Inside the Pleasure Dome.
Beautiful, inbred Sacramento.
I don't know, whatever he called it.
So, no, that didn't have a number.
That was Studio Zero.
Let's see.
And Zether says, I knew you guys were joking.
We're not joking.
We are saying goodbye to the studio.
We are moving.
Yeah.
No, we were joking.
I am leaving this house.
DarkSakura is moving.
We have to be out of here by the third so that we get money.
Bobby, just to let you know, our next step is to buy a house.
Good luck.
Alright, so we'll be back in two weeks from somewhere.
Welcome to adult life, kids.
This is what you have to look forward to.
Growing up sucks.
Life's gonna suck when you grow up.
When you grow up, when you grow up.
Life's gonna suck when you grow up.
It sucks pretty bad right now.
Uh, okay, so I guess that's, what else can we say about that?
I don't think there is anything else to say about that.
So, goodbye Studio 5 after tonight.
Maybe, the good news is maybe we can get a webcam again, maybe we can be better wired to stream games, because this studio was really kind of supposed to be, well, wasn't it supposed to be temporary?
Yeah.
You're on my drawing table.
It just kind of lasted.
Although I got it at Ikea and it's not really a drawing table, so whatever.
I have to tell you, though, our new house is super cute.
You know what I just realized?
What?
This is one of my old roommate's folding chairs.
I totally jacked it from him for this studio.
Yes, it is.
Oops.
So we can bring a piece of the old studio with us.
That's right, we can.
But man, this house, though, is super cute.
And we'll get to keep the pinball tables in the living room.
that's good, pinball tables are important our landlord walked in today because he came in to sign the papers with us and he looked in the pinball room and was like, what is this?
we were like, this is our coolness, sir he was like, I haven't seen pinball in years I was like, that's super cool
I'm a designer, damn it.
Give me design stuff to do.
Alright, I think we're going to move into some of tonight's news, but we need to be a little bit flexible because the interview should be calling in any minute, so we might have to kind of like, because this is a live interview tonight, so if you want to ask questions you can in chat.orangelandre.com So Loki, I guess go ahead and try to start us off here, we might have to kind of cut in in the middle here
Sure, why not?
If there's a report coming from Bloomberg saying, and this is basically saying something that they've already kind of rumored to before, Microsoft is going to create its own TV programming for Xbox Live, which is great, because I was hoping they would kind of do that, because as much as I like to see on-demand stuff for Comcast, which I can get by an on-demand, well, I used to be able to get via on-demand, but unfortunately now we have a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I feel like if I want to watch something what I really need to do to make it work is to go queue it up on my computer in my playlist and then go to my Xbox and watch it on the Xbox I mean if you want to watch like popular YouTubes and things like that like that's really easy to find because it shows you the most popular what about like a stuff you're subscribing to is it easy to find that
Yeah, that does all kind of pop up.
It's not bad.
You can link it to your YouTube.
Basically, you say link to my YouTube account and it'll show you a code on the screen and you go run to your computer and type that code in while you're signed into Google and then it links the two together.
Kind of like how Netflix works.
But it works.
I mean, it's... Fantastic.
Why?
I don't know.
This sounds stupid.
Here's the thing, and I don't know if you know this, Loki.
You can't watch any clip that's been flagged for copyright content.
You know how YouTube will keep some of the copyright content stuff up, but it'll just have a link to whatever song is being used in it at the bottom?
Say, this has stuff from UMG Music Group, and click here to buy the song.
All of those are pulled from Xbox Live.
which I actually I get why because you know there's all the jukebox usage rights and all that stuff and they don't want to pay it but it does put a damper on some of the things that you want to really watch on YouTube but like I would think like okay like the way that Jamie and Dan have it set up they watch YouTube's a lot on their TV of like game playthroughs and stuff yeah but I don't think they should have to change that but not everybody sets up a rig like that
Here's the thing, though.
I understand that it's kind of cool that they have that and stuff, but I'll tell you this much.
To get a rig to actually watch YouTube videos on a TV is fucking dirt cheap.
I mean, so dirt cheap, it's ridiculous.
I remember actually one time, well, it was last year, actually.
No, actually this year.
I was doing that Project Under $100 thing where I was going to create a main cabinet under $100.
I didn't want to build a MAME cabinet out of cardboard boxes.
You came out with $101 and you were like, shit!
No, I was able to do it under $100.
I just didn't want to.
I still have the computer and stuff in my garage.
I bought the computer for $30.
It's a Pentium 4 for $30.
It's capable of running MAME and most of the games for it.
But a Pentium 4 computer can also run YouTube, I mean, I think for the most part.
And hell, you can even get like, you know, mini ITX computers or Atom computers or whatever.
Very, very dirt cheap if you want to set up something that's mainly for watching YouTube videos.
Or fuck, any other, if you have a computer at home, just move it next to the computer, you know, to your TV and you can watch...
Hello?
Hello?
What is up, Justin?
First off, thank you so much for calling in tonight.
You're on vacation or something right now, right?
I am.
I'm halfway home from Disneyland.
Me and the lady drove out there, hung out a couple days, and we're heading back to Vegas now.
Nice.
I saw you did my tip at Haunted Mansion on Foursquare.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you left a couple tips throughout Disneyland and I did whatever I found.
I probably did.
Well, that's awesome.
Well, anyway, Justin, thanks for calling in tonight.
I tried to give a little bit of background before you called in tonight, but everybody knows you're calling in to talk about Xbox hacks tonight.
And I got to say, I've been following your updates through Twitter because you and I got hacked squarely.
Okay, sure.
First time you ever found out your Xbox got hacked, what happened?
How did you find out you were hacked?
Alright, let me start by saying I am on the road, and if signal cuts out, you know, I'll call back.
But just let me know if the signal starts cutting out, we'll make it work.
No worries.
So, day one, back in August, it was like August, mid-August, say the 13th, 14th, something like that.
I get an email saying that my, what was it?
I got a purchase confirmation for altogether $125 worth of Microsoft points.
Was it all that FIFA stuff?
Was it the FIFA stuff?
What's that?
Was it the FIFA 12 stuff that it seems like?
No, actually, the FIFA stuff, mine had nothing to do with any of the FIFA stuff.
I've heard a ton of people getting screwed over by the FIFA thing.
and apparently that was because there's something you can do on FIFA where it equates to real money.
I guess that people are building these super teams in FIFA by purchasing players.
They have booster packs basically and then they're selling the killer teams on eBay or what have you.
So that's why people are getting screwed over with the FIFA stuff.
But mine was not related to that at all.
I got one confirmation for $75 and then another one for $50.
I found it probably a couple hours after it happened.
So I went in, I checked all my stuff, I had to reset my password to get in there.
Saw that they had bought a bunch of, I think they bought Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, some DLC for both of those, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, DLC for that, some themes, and then just some other mislaying and stuff.
but it was all just kind of random stuff and I thought that they had played a little bit of them.
So I called Microsoft, well first I called the bank.
I called Bank of America and I said, hey, fraudulent charges, yada yada.
They said, okay, we'll just take care of it.
The next day they had my money back so no problems there.
I called Microsoft right after I called the bank and I told them what had happened and they said, okay, well,
We're sorry this happened.
We're going to close your account down while we look into it, and we'll have this taken care of within 25 business days or something like that.
It will be no longer than 25 or 30 days.
One thing I want to jump in here and point out real quick, just one small difference between what you did and what I did, is that you called your bank first, and I didn't do that.
I called Microsoft first.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I find that kind of interesting because I wonder if that's part of the reason why your story is going to take a different turn here in a minute, but...
Anyway, sorry, I just wanted to point that out.
Go ahead.
Okay, so yeah, I waited a little while, probably three or four weeks, and then I called back and said, hey, just checking in, just want to see what's going on, and they said, well, you know, we're still working on it.
I said, okay, cool.
So I waited a little bit longer, a couple weeks passed, and at this point, we're past the 25 days they had voted me.
So I called back and I said, hey, you know, you guys missed your deadline, I just wanted to get a status update, find out what's going on, and
You know, same as before, they were apologetic.
They didn't have any news for me.
They told me there's nothing they can do to figure out with any more detail what's actually going on.
And that I just had to stick it out.
So at that point, I said, well, can you guys hook me up with anything to make stuff for it?
They said, sure, here's the code for a free month of Xbox Live.
And they assured me that that would be on top of whatever time I get reimbursed at the end of the whole fiasco.
So I said, all right, well, free month of Live, whatever.
Hung up, went about my business.
A few more weeks passed, and I called back, and they said the same thing.
I whined about it a little more.
They gave me another coat for a month of live, and that was that.
A few more weeks passed, and this is the point where I start making angry Facebook posts and Twitter posts and Google Plus posts and just trying to let everyone know that, hey, I'm getting screwed over here.
At this point, you've said a few weeks, a few weeks, a few weeks, so you're talking like you're at 10, 12 weeks at this point, right?
Yeah, this is probably somewhere between two and three months.
Around two months is when I started getting really upset because
I wasn't playing my Xbox a whole lot.
I figured at least I'll have this all sorted by the time all the good games start coming out and I'll be able to play Modern Warfare 3 and all that stuff.
So what I really got upset was the day Modern Warfare 3 came out.
Now I'm not a fan of the Modern Warfare series, but I figured this was going to be the year I was going to get it and start playing with all my friends and get into all that stuff.
Well, I bought Modern Warfare 3 and then remembered, oh wait, I can't play online, so...
I called again that night, and I said, look, this wasn't a problem before, but games are starting to come out that I want to play, so I need to have this fixed.
And same thing, just, I'm sorry, but I can't help you, I don't have any more information, we're very sorry this happened, but there's nothing we can do.
So, what else can I do, you know?
I was starting to feel pretty hopeless at this point.
I said, okay, well, deal with it.
and I started playing something on my Wii, I think.
I went back and started playing Mario Galaxy or something.
So, a couple more weeks passed and I'm at the point where I'm telling them every time I call, like, look, I'm going to call every week now and keep on doing this until I get a result.
And I did so.
I kept on calling and every time they just would give me the runaround and say, no, there's nothing we can do.
So...
About a week ago, I got an email saying, hey, we see that you regained access to your account, so we're closing your case.
Have fun.
And I was on my way to work at this time, so I couldn't check on it immediately.
But when I got to work, I went online and I checked it out, and I still couldn't get to my account via Xbox.com.
It still said your account is temporarily blocked.
And to point this out, you're talking from August to a week ago, December.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, from mid-August until last week.
All right.
So I got the email.
It said that everything was good.
I went to Xbox.com and found out that everything was not good because I still couldn't get to my account.
So I called them on my lunch break, and I said, look, I got this email.
I mean, this has been going on since August.
Try and understand my frustration here.
I apologize up front because I knew I was going to get hostile at some point during the phone call.
so I told them the whole situation let them read over my case notes gave them like three service request numbers I had told them you know I want to be able to play my Xbox now I got this email but I still can't get to my account and they said oh okay well go to your console and I said well I'm not at my console on my lunch break so they said alright well call us back later when you're at your console and at this point I really felt like I was getting ripped off here so I
I asked them if they could do anything like give me a year of Xbox Live to make up for because what's a year of Xbox Live?
40 or 50 bucks, right?
So I asked them that and they said, no, unfortunately we can't do that.
That's kind of what I was expecting.
So I said, alright, well, can I talk to someone who can hook that up?
And she said, well, let me talk to my supervisor but she won't be able to do anything either.
So the supervisor came on, told her the whole situation, asked her for a year of life.
She said, no, I can't do that.
I can give you
and two extra months.
We see that you already got two months before.
I can give you two more months and that'll make up for the four months that you lost and that'll be that.
And at this point, I'm a little angry because before, when I got those two one-month codes, they told me that those months would be on top of whatever time I was reimbursed.
Oh, right, right.
So I relayed this information to the supervisor I was now talking to and she said, well, you were misinformed.
We can give you two months or not.
Take it or leave it.
and so I, I mean, I never, ever yell at people on the phone because I know they have shitty jobs and I would hate to be answering phones all day.
So, I blew up at this point.
I just, you know, kind of let her have it.
I said, look, I mean, this has been four months and you don't, I don't think you understand how much trouble this has been for me.
I've been on the phone literally like five or six hours total with Microsoft trying to get this resolved and all because some jerk off
hacked another bank account or hacked into my Xbox account and spent a bunch of my money.
Like, I feel like I'm being punished for nothing I did.
And she was not very receptive to that.
She just kind of reiterated, I can give you two months on top of the two months we already gave you.
And that's that.
So we went back and forth.
You know, I kept on saying this is ridiculous, this is ridiculous.
And she kept insisting there was nothing she could do.
Finally,
She conceded and said, okay, well, I'll give you 500 points in addition to the two months.
Woohoo!
Yeah, exactly.
Five bucks?
What is that, six bucks?
500 Microsoft points would be... What does that translate to?
625.
Yeah, 625.
625, okay, so yeah, worth $6.25 to Microsoft as a customer.
And I told her, like, you realize you're about to lose a customer over, you know, 50 bucks, right?
Because...
All I'm asking for is a year of Xbox Live.
She just kept on reiterating she couldn't do anything.
So I took what I could get from her because my lunch break was over and I had to get back to work.
I left her my contact info and asked her to have her supervisor... Oh, right, I asked to speak to her supervisor earlier on the call and she said that he wouldn't be in until the next day in the evening.
So she was apparently the highest level person I could talk to at that time.
so anyway she said she would pass along my contact information to her boss and have him call me back which never happened by the way so later that night I actually sorry when I got back from lunch when I was back in my office I typed out that quick Google Plus post basically saying like this is what's going on this is you know an update because I had posted probably three or four times previous after each call and kind of updated everyone as to what's going on I don't know how many people
and Major Nelson.
and Major Nelson actually replied to me on Google+, but sorry, I had a bad experience.
Shoot me an email with your gamertag and your service request number and let me see if I can figure out what's going on.
So I sent him an email the next day.
He said, all right, cool, I'm going to investigate it.
And a few hours later, I got a call from Beth at Exceptions Management.
And she was, yeah, they have an Exceptions Management department.
So...
I spoke to Beth for a while.
She was amazing, super friendly, super personable, very empathetic, helped me get everything sorted.
Got my account unlocked for me while I was on the phone.
Waited for me to make sure I could get into it.
Just to make it clear, before you could get to this person who could actually handle your issue and take care of everything right there on the spot, it sounds like she had the button.
You had to go through Major Nelson to get to her.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
Let's step back even further here.
They have a department for people that make exceptions to the rule.
What?
And I even pointed out to her, like, you know, this would have been so much easier if the supervisor earlier could have just taken care of this for me.
And she said, no, they actually can't do that.
They don't have that ability.
But Beth, who I was speaking to, did have the ability.
They don't have the ability to help you.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, so Beth or whoever, finally, it sounds like satisfies you.
Like, you know, what do they hook you up with in the end?
Yeah, well, so she took care of me, and she was like, okay, well, we're all set.
and without me even asking, she said, well, how about, you know, I know you asked them for a year before, how about six months?
That's, you know, I think that's what I could really get away with doing.
At that point, I was just so happy that she was willing to help me and all that.
She kind of offered it without me bugging about it.
I said, okay, six months is fine.
So she gave me a couple codes for, you know, two, three month codes to redeem and, you know, I was happy with that.
I got a little something for it.
I felt like Microsoft was trying to appease me at that point and I was just happy I could get back into my account.
So all's better, right?
All's well that ends well, right?
We're done?
Well, not yet.
Not yet.
We're almost done.
So I go home and I play a couple games on live.
Everything's cool.
Next morning I wake up and as I'm driving to work, I see I get an email that says, Hey, we noticed you added a new email to your account, which I did not do.
And it's some Oscar-418 at Hotmail.com or something random like that.
and so, I mean, yeah, I got hacked again less than 24 hours after this was all resolved.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, put the brakes on, put the brakes on.
Hold on.
You were out of your Xbox Live account for four months.
Finally, thanks to Major Nelson, you get back in.
24 hours later.
24 hours later, you're hacked again.
Yes.
So, I said, screw this, I'm not talking to Microsoft again.
As long as I can hold on.
Oh, damn it.
Now we're getting the service drop.
Hold on.
Can you still hear us?
Hi.
Go back a little bit.
We lost you for a second.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I got the email.
Sorry.
I lost track there.
I logged in on my phone to Xbox.com, went to change my password and all that stuff.
As soon as I got to work, I deleted all my email accounts.
I
associated my account with new email accounts, changed my password to something completely new that's never been used anywhere, made sure that this person had not made any purchases on my account.
All my points were still there.
There was no activity.
So I just booted that email address off my account and made everything brand new, basically.
So far, since then, everything is good.
Okay, I have to ask these questions because the listeners will kill me if I don't ask these questions to get some things clear.
You changed your password between the first time and the second time, right?
Yes.
It was not a brand new password.
It was one that I've used in other places before.
So one theory that I have is that maybe this traces back to when all the websites and Sony and all that got hacked.
Maybe they got my...
Password from something like that, associated editor, but it was not my same password from before.
But it was still different.
They somehow got two different passwords a year.
Yeah, and I think, I was wondering also, maybe they hacked into the email account that was associated with my Xbox account, and that's how they were doing it.
Because if you have the email account, you can reset the password.
You can get a reset link sent to that email address.
That could make sense.
Maybe they did something like that, or maybe they did some social engineering and
I got a service rupture request to reset it or something like that, but you know, that stuff happens.
I'm usually pretty careful with this stuff.
We need you to log in here or something like that.
I don't click the link.
I open a browser and I type in the URL.
So I'm positive that I didn't get phished.
And that's an easy thing for a company to say, you know?
Put the blame on the users and make them think that it's not their fault.
so alright so since we gotta wrap this up and get back to the show at some point but I wanna just kinda summarize here you were hacked you went through four months of hoops finally after getting Major Nelson involved you speak to the super secret department of Microsoft who can actually fix things when you talk to them 24 hours later you're hacked again yeah and so I wanna I wanna make sure that I emphasize that Major Nelson once I got to that point
Super helpful.
Everything was taken care of pretty quickly.
Microsoft just really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the initial interactions.
When this happens, they need to be a lot more swift with this.
Their investigation team, as they kept calling it, needs to be more accessible and they need to get this stuff done faster because the fact that I had to get Major Nelson involved, I mean, I felt terrible trying to get his attention on Twitter because it was taken care of in the first place.
but once I did, everything was taken care of, so I don't know, I don't want to encourage people to just tweet at Major Nelson whenever things go wrong, but I mean, that's what I ended up having to do to make this work, and
That's just insane, you know?
But Microsoft denies there's a problem.
EA denies there's a problem.
Yeah, and I know that you got hacked, and I've heard a few other people.
Like, I posted, when this initially happened, I write for Nukesilla, so I posted a story on there basically saying, hey, I just got hacked, so PSA, you guys might want to change your passwords.
So I got a bunch of comments on there, probably half a dozen people saying the same thing was happening to them.
And I Googled around, found a ton of other people getting hacked.
So, I mean, it's not an isolated issue.
This is something that's happening a lot.
I don't know what the common thread is, but it's not something that only a few people are getting hit by.
I've talked to a lot of other people, like friends of mine, who said, oh yeah, I just had to go through that too.
So what happens from here?
Do you think this is something you can put behind you in a couple months and say, alright, whatever, I'm a Microsoft fan again, woohoo, Modern Warfare on my Xbox, pew pew, or is this like permanently damaged things?
I mean, there's definitely permanent damage.
I think it's insane that Sony got basically crucified for the hacks a few months ago, but I can't think of a single instance in which anybody actually got, there was any fraudulent credit card activity.
You know, I didn't hear of anybody actually losing money over that.
But this is going on with Microsoft, and it's widespread, and there's no press about it.
I mean, people aren't talking about this.
What can Microsoft do to make amends?
They need to fix their security holes, whatever they may be, or maybe send out a forced password reset.
I don't know.
They need to do something about it.
I think people need to be talking about this more so that people are more aware and they can go and change their passwords.
Oh, one more thing I wanted to add to my story because I forgot to mention it in the middle of it.
Yeah, yeah.
They called me about a month in and said they needed my console ID and serial number.
I did not have that with me, so I called back a couple days and gave it to them.
But they tried to use that as ammo when they were talking about how long it was taking.
They said, well, we needed the console ID and serial number, so that resets the timer.
And I said, well, you know, that was three months ago.
I just wanted to throw that in there in the interest of having all the facts.
How about look at where he's logging in from?
it took him a month to even ask me for that silly alright well Justin I gotta wrap up so we can get back to tonight's news but thank you so much for calling in and sharing the story with you I don't know what else to say I'm glad you got resolution from Microsoft but I agree with you Microsoft needs to admit there's a problem more than putting because what Microsoft's doing here and there's a pattern it's what happened to you it's what they're saying on the internet it's what they're saying to MXT they're saying the user base is the problem we're the problem we're getting fished
We're causing issues.
We're not providing the console ID numbers in time.
The customer is not right, is what I'm hearing from Microsoft.
It's definitely something on Microsoft's end.
I'm still going to play games on my Xbox, but I'm definitely going to be playing more games on my PS3 as well.
Hey, home just got a renovation there.
It's worth checking out.
Well, I was just going to ask now, did you have the same email associated with your PlayStation Network account as you did with your Xbox Live account?
Yes, it was the same email address.
See, so that's the thing.
That's why I was thinking it might have something to do with it.
DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?
Checking my account.
I recommend everybody do the same thing.
For God's sake, change your password.
Everyone listening right now, log into Xbox.com right now.
Change the email address associated with your account.
Change your password and change your security question.
I changed mine ages ago.
Well, not ages ago, but like about a month and a half ago.
Right, right.
All right.
Very good.
Well, Justin, thank you again so much.
And God, I hope it doesn't happen a third time.
What else can I say?
Well, thank you very much for having me.
All right, no problem.
Drive safe.
Oh, wait, did you want to plug your site or anything?
What's that?
Did you want to plug your site or anything?
I don't know if it's appropriate, but... Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Check out Nukesilla.com.
We're actually in the middle of a month-long review Nukestravaganza right now, where every day we're writing a review of a game.
First day, we wrote one sentence for the review.
Second day was a two-sentence review.
That was my Pokemon review, actually.
and so on until the end of the month.
So we're about halfway through that right now.
Go check it out.
It is blowing up over there at Nookzilla.com.
Absolutely.
Take care, buddy.
Bye.
Wow, wow, and more wow.
Apparently, MXT in a chat was saying that, oh my god, they did the same thing to me as far as asking for the console ID and serial number.
What's that?
Oh, what's that?
That they did the same thing to him Oh, MXT, really?
Oh my gosh I mean, think about it We don't have that big of an audience When you consider the entire internet We have, what, maybe 50, 60 people in chat right now, right?
And the fact that Justin's on the phone And one out of these 50 people is like Oh yeah, I'm going through this too What?
This isn't a problem?
for Donculus.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
But it's the thing, though, is they're right in the fact that, yeah, it's not through... I mean, if someone's getting access to your email account, how's that their problem?
I mean, that's not their fault that someone got access to your email because you happen to use the same password that you use with the PlayStation Network stuff and that list got leaked out.
To be fair, Justin might have made a mistake if his email password and his Xbox Live were the same.
But, you know, it's...
and DarkSakura.com.
Change address line 2 in your account to read Xbox support do not assist with recovery.
That way when the folks look at your account and see it, they won't try to accidentally give out any information or make any changes or whatever if somebody's trying to get it done that way.
I find that interesting.
An interesting way to do it.
At the end of the day, honestly, I'm getting to the point where I'm using unique passwords on different websites.
And it's kind of a pain in the ass to remember them all, but it's like what I have to do.
So anyway.
All right.
Moving on.
We spent a good 20 minutes on that topic, but you know what?
It's important.
And Justin's right.
Not enough people are talking about it.
And I said that back in August, and I'm saying it now.
At least we're finally saying, okay, well, finally we're seeing that Xbox and EA's denying
There's a problem in warning people to not get fished.
I guess that's a baby step.
Yeah, but see, that's the thing, though, is they don't even...
Why didn't they just say, hey, you know, back... I mean, another video game console provider or something like that was hacked earlier this year and emails were leaked out.
You may want to check that.
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know if they can't say that because that's, you know, untactful or whatever, but...
I mean, obviously there's something going on.
Or maybe they need some sort of restrictions for how much you can spend in a day or something like that.
I think they need to just do the forced password reset.
And they don't want to get raked through the holes like Sony did.
They're scared shitless of what happened to Sony.
Yeah, but if they do a forced password reset, people are going, why are you doing that?
Oh, well, because there's a lot of people getting hacked.
I mean, they're not going to come out and say that.
It draws suspicion, so...
Alright, let's move on with news.
That took up a big chunk of time, so we want to quickly get through this.
and they're saying that they're thinking the original programming via Xbox Live Dashboard including the Majors Minute, Xbox 101, etc.
and also possible tie-ins with IGN and all that stuff.
Of course, they had MSNBC so it makes sense that they do that.
And of course...
This week they had the launch of a few more applications.
YouTube, TMZ, Verizon, FIOS, if you happen to have that.
And I believe, was it iHeartRadio, MSNBC, Muzu TV if you're in some of the European countries, Rogers On Demand in Canada, SBS On Demand in Australia, and RTVE in Spain.
Oh, and MSN Video in some of the European countries and BlinkBox.
I've never heard of BlinkBox.
All different streaming stuff there.
TMZ, I haven't even looked at that.
I actually looked at the TMZ stuff.
It's similar to the phone app.
It's celebrity gossip.
They go out and get the videos, the raw footage of celebrities walking out of famous restaurants and stuff.
They do a live show that I think is broadcast on Sirius and all that.
If you like Hollywood gossip stuff, which I don't think many of you do, but that might be a way for them to try and reach out to a different demographic.
Here's what I don't like about it.
I think it would be awesome if it was actually set up like TV.
Like you have channels.
It's just not...
It's easier for me to log into a computer and type TMZ.com or hit a button on my phone.
I don't think the Kinect interface is yet there.
If I want to go check TMZ, I don't go sit on my couch.
Xbox, Kinect, TMZ, Bing.
I think they should have live TV or something like that as an option.
They should have these TMZ channels where they have some TMZ shows or whatever they're on at certain times and then you watch it actually like TV instead of, you know,
Having to because I think that would be really cool and that would get a lot more people interested in it because it's in addition to their own TV they can actually watch you know the Xbox like TV instead of oh hey look I can keep all these videos yeah you know what you can do that with the PC and I'm sure most people out there have PCs even if you don't have an Xbox so why would you bother downloading this app and going through all this crap you know it's just it's more of a hassle.
Maybe once they have a remote control or something.
I just don't think Kinect is as fast as they want it to be.
They do have a remote control.
Do they?
Yeah, remember they have the little infrared remotes.
I agree with your whole thing.
It needs to be channel up and channel down or something like that to get to the stuff.
It should be like web TV.
Well, not necessarily web TV, but like IPTV or something like that.
Speaking of MSNBC, I want to break in real quick with some real world news.
What is it with world news going on in the middle of our show?
Because remember earlier this year, Osama bin Laden was reported dead and all that.
Who did they kill this time?
Well, they didn't kill anybody, but Kim Jong-il from North Korea has died, according to the Associated Press, and it's on MSNBC.com.
Oh, which I mean, not to be crass.
I mean, it's sad when a world leader dies.
I realize he's a controversial figure.
I'm just going to stay far away from that and just say I believe it was reported he was having he had pancreatic cancer related issues.
So, you know, and that was the same thing that got Steve Jobs, sadly.
So that cancer sucks.
That's my point.
So, there you go.
If that, I mean, allegedly, that's what, obviously with world leaders, they're always very secretive, but, you know, there you have it.
All right, moving on.
More gaming news.
So who's going to be making a Death Knight of him?
In WoW?
In WoW.
Yeah, I remember my friend from Horde House, Matt, had RIP Steve Jobs already for the big day.
All right, anyhow, the Circle Pad is coming out in the US.
That's, of course, a little attachment for the 3DS, an extra little thing there on the 3DS.
However, it's coming out February 7th, so it'll be out next year.
It'll be $20, which I guess is a reasonable price.
But here's the deal.
It's a GameStop exclusive.
Yet again, Nintendo has chosen to go the GameStop exclusive route.
But this time, I don't believe you can get it on Nintendo.com, can you?
No.
Thank you for watching!
I hate this.
You guys all know how I feel about it.
It's no secret.
I hate that it's all this exclusive retailer stuff and I'm not going to support it and it pisses me off.
I actually kind of wanted that circle pad but not for the reason you think.
I don't know about you guys but I've had my hand hurt playing Mario Kart because I don't think that the 3DS is very ergonomically designed very well because my thumb starts to hurt from the acceleration button and trying to use the shoulder buttons for a long period of time where you have to hold the A button down.
it's not bothered me in any other game to date like it doesn't bother me in Mario 3D Land it only bothers me in Mario Kart but I was thinking if I had kind of the extension that that circle pad provides that there's more rest for my thumb there and it might work better but I'm not buying it this way I guess I could import one but I don't like that idea either to be honest I guess I'm just going to have to wait for the 3DS redesign that will release the 3DS they probably should have put out in the first place
Yeah, they'll do a 3DS redesign.
But here's the thing I suggested to us on Twitter.
It's a peripheral.
There'll be third-party solutions for it.
And there'll be probably third-party solutions that are even better than the official Nintendo one.
So just wait to get it.
I mean...
There's no reason you need to rush out and do it.
And honestly, before we were saying, oh, maybe the reason that GameStop has the exclusive on Xenoblade is because they may have helped to pay for the import stuff.
But for the Circle Pad, I don't think so.
I think that's just, I don't know, unless that was part of the Xenoblade stuff.
I don't know.
Yeah, so I'm not happy about the whole thing, but I don't know what Nintendo has to gain from this, to be honest, by being in bed with GameStop so much.
Here's the only thing I can think of.
I hate that this is a pattern.
That they think that this is going to be a niche product, and that they don't want to save money, they're going to ship everything to one source, basically, GameStop.
They do this in distribution all the time.
Or even their direct retail partners is that these companies will, to save money, they will drop retail partners and make them go through distribution to drop the amount of locations to save on freight and just streamline everything.
So they don't have to ship to all these different locations.
They ship to five locations instead and let them sort it out from there.
So maybe that's what they're doing with this because they're thinking that they're just not going to sell a lot of it.
I think they're right.
They're not going to sell a lot of it because it's not a peripheral that's absolutely needed for some stuff.
It's nice, but once again, this totally screams that they're going to do a revision of this thing.
I can kind of see where you're going with that.
It is a bit of a niche thing.
The developers are kind of in a stuck place.
They can't really design games to require this, especially now.
I think Everett, they're not going to be able to.
well hold on though because the new Zelda game requires Wii Motion Plus which really wasn't a part of the Wii when they do a redesign of the 3DS eventually I think they could start to require it kind of down the line but I don't think they could it's going to be a good year or two I mean that's how long games take to develop anyway I think if they're going to start doing games that require stuff they better do it sooner than later because they want the least amount of consoles to be affected by it alright well let's move on to DarkSakura with some news
There's news, it exists, and this one is about Square Enix.
The Square Enix members site actually was shut down.
And according to Square Enix, they said that they were actually looking to see exactly how deep the breach goes.
It looks like it was indeed hacked.
So they said that it was a server that was used by members in the US and Japan.
And so they shut down the service so that they can see exactly what's going on.
They said they can't confirm that there's any possibility of credit card information leak since that server that was hacked doesn't contain any credit card information.
But they're going to look through it and double check everybody.
So if you were on there, your credit card's safe.
If not, ain't your problem.
So, there's that.
At least it's not, you know, your Xbox getting hacked.
At least nothing was taken.
But once again, though, if you have your email associated with that Square Enix account that, you know, may also be associated with a console, or, you know, you may share a password on that site that you also share on your console, you may think about changing that.
Just...
Just to be on the safe side.
Yarp.
So there's been a lot of lawsuits against Sony for different things.
One of the more popular ones is the other OS removal.
And there was a class action lawsuit actually with Sony about that.
And a federal judge has dismissed all counts of the suit.
It's interesting though.
I guess this is...
All of the claims have been dismissed, I guess, back in February.
But I guess they amended their claims, and of course they dismissed the amended claims as well.
And the quote they have from, I guess, Judge Richard Seaborg,
Too bad, so sad.
Yeah, so basically they allowed the people to keep the other OS, but they obviously had to decline the update, and basically it was well within Sony's rights to do that, whether you like it or not.
I think that's part of the end-user license agreement is that they can do that kind of stuff.
Isn't that what we were saying?
and technically, you know, it wasn't an advertised feature on the box even though it was something that they talked about in different developer conferences and E3 and stuff like that in the little fine notes there but it wasn't something that they go, hey, you can run Linux on this because, I mean...
I don't know.
You can put Linux on anything anyway.
Then again though, you can still kind of run Linux on it if you jailbreak it and give it an amount of time or some more time and jailbreaking will probably be legal soon enough and then you can do what you want.
But once again, they can also prevent you from playing online if they have that ability.
Although, I mean, if you think about it, this not only does, you know, the other OS thing doesn't necessarily just stop you from playing online.
It stops you from playing new games because new games require firmware updates that are included on the disc and those updates remove other OS.
So, it kind of sucks.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
I mean, just maybe buy a computer that do Linux instead of actually using, you know,
your Playstation 3 unless you're the military and then you can buy a whole bunch of them just specifically for that but it's just either going to be a computer or a game console they're busy curing cancer you can still do the folding at home without having the other OS stuff I never used the other OS I thought about it for a while but just never got around to it
I have a laptop with Linux on it.
What do I need that for on my... Yeah.
I think people are just looking for a reason to have their panties in a bunch.
Yeah.
So real quick, let's talk a little bit.
I'm sure we already kind of talked about this during kind of what we're playing this week.
But yes, in case you haven't heard, and you happen to have bought a 3DS early on, you're one of the early adopters, if you will.
You are, of course, going to get some more games as part of the Ambassadors program.
You'll be getting 10 free Game Boy Advance games as well, and this is kind of cool.
Some actually really good games in there, which I was very pleasantly surprised to see.
They include Super Mario Advance 3 Yoshi's Island, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare Mega Micro Games...
Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Wario Land 4, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, The Sacred Stones, The Legend of Zelda, The Minish Cap, and F-Zero Maximum Velocity.
Some of those games actually I recently sold with one of my old DSs.
I gotta say, some of those games have an H2L either.
I played the Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero, which I love the F-Zero on the GameCube, but...
F-Zero on Game Boy Advance
And I gotta say, Mario Kart 7, man, that's a good-looking game.
I mean, the screenshots don't do it justice at all, or even the gameplay video doesn't do it justice.
Right.
But, man, it's just really crisp.
But some of the other, like, Game Boy Advance, like Metroid is great.
Metroid Fusion, yeah.
WarioWare is amazing.
You know, there's a lot of great...
You know what's the best?
Even though it's not in the bundle, it's still the best.
River City Ransom.
What, on Game Boy Advance?
That's right.
Heck yeah, it was really good.
But that's not a first-party Nintendo game.
I think that's the one thing all these games have in common.
No, but I'm saying that it's a game that has aged well.
And hello, Super Mario 2 Yoshi's Island, which, yes, I realize is whatever they redid it as for the Game Boy Advance, but still, that's an amazing game.
And then also, one thing I read, kind of a little tip, because I know the Game Boy Advance stuff gets stretched out when you play it.
You can actually hold start or select while you're starting the game up, and it will shrink it down.
Yeah, funny enough, Kaijudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, Rob, did you play the Game Boy Advance games in small window mode?
Yeah, I actually didn't like it.
I didn't mind the stretched images, especially for, like, WarioWare.
It doesn't matter.
Those games weren't, like...
Cutting edge graphics.
But I can see where the stretch gets kind of yucky on some of the other games.
So I get why you can do that.
But it's too small.
Windows is too small when you do it that way.
Zether in our chat room is saying, you know, the Game Boy Advance F-Zero is more of a throwback to the SNES games.
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
Well, I have some more stuff.
This actually has to do with Ultima Online 2.
There was apparently something said by Richard Garriott who was looking to talk to EA about publishing a new Ultima Online.
He said that they would love to have access to the Ultima property and had discussions with EA about it.
But EA apparently is not down for that.
They've said, no, we're not.
What's he talking about?
In fact, the quote actually says, I'm not sure what Richard Garriott is referring to.
So it doesn't look like that might actually be happening.
Maybe he's feeling a little bit sorrowful that Tabula Rasa didn't work out, the space thing.
Maybe.
Not really doing that now.
But there is something about an Ultimate Collector project that does start with Ultim.
Maybe.
No.
No.
Ultima was a great series, though.
I would like to see it make a comeback in some form or another.
I know they have the web game, I think was the last big thing I saw them doing, but some people are still freaking playing Ultima Online.
They gave it a big redesign a few years ago to kind of make it a little more current, so it's kind of cool.
We'll see.
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and check out what's coming out to an arcade, or excuse me, a home console, I wish an arcade, but to a console near you soon.
Uh, well.
Probably not a lot, right?
Yeah.
Uh, I hope you like Star Wars The Old Republic, because that's all that's coming out this week on PC.
Nice.
That's it.
All right.
It's pretty dead.
Let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out there.
Now, I do want to point out the Vita is out in Japan.
That was one of the big releases of this past week.
And, of course, you see a lot of the unboxing videos and a lot of stuff has appeared online.
I thought about importing it until I saw the $600 for just the console thing.
Oh, my God.
Like $100 each.
Fuck that.
No, thank you.
All right, things are a little more exciting in Japan than just one game.
This week on the Xbox 360, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 gets a dubbed version for Japanese release this week.
Divinity 2, the Dragon Knight Saga, and Musou Orochi 2 comes in a regular and treasure box edition from Koei Tecmo comes out this week on the Xbox 360.
Is this a fighting game?
I think this is a fighting series.
Oh yeah, it's a fighting series from Koei.
It's probably like a Dynasty Warriors Universe fighter.
Orochi has to do with a legend, an old legend.
What was it?
Was it Orochi?
Yeah.
Musou.
Yeah.
I think it might be all that stuff.
On the PlayStation 3, pretty much the same games I just mentioned.
Modern Warfare 3, Musou Orochi 2.
A couple extra games there, though.
GQ, Powerful Pro Yaku 2011.
Yeah.
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit gets a price reduction.
And next week in Japan, I've got to get this out there because we're not going to be here next week, The Idolmaster.
Gravure for You Volume 3 comes out next week.
I know The Idolmaster is a really big series over in Japan.
Going to some of the other consoles.
I want to check out at least the Wii and the Vita.
Nothing really on the Wii that I can see.
Rob, my name, my brain combined them into the WIDA
uh any late starts out the gate oh yeah ultimate ultimate marvel versus capcom 3 oh that's a general asia asia region release comes out this week and quickly let me look on a 3ds there is a looks like there's a branded nintendo 3s a gundam 3ds oh no the sd card it's just the sd cards
Oh no, no, this is the full 3DS.
Are they SD Gundam cards?
Yeah, yeah, like they're SD cards, little Gundam characters, and then they actually have a 3DS that has... That makes it funny because they're SD Gundams.
It was a series, SD Gundam.
I gotcha.
Well, there is a game also to go with it, SD Gundam G Generation 3D.
SD Gundams are so cute.
Alright, there you go.
That's your Japanese releases.
UK, on the 20th, Star Wars The Old Republic, and the 21st, Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD on PS3.
That's it.
Pretty quick series of release dates.
Chirp.
That's what happens this time of year.
All right, Loki.
All right.
It's always dead this time of year.
But thankfully, though, it won't be dead too long in the first quarter of next year.
Nintendo's announced their upcoming release list for their titles, hitting Wii and 3DS, and of course on Nintendo DS as well.
Some notable stuff, Kid Icarus Uprising, getting a date finally.
It's going to be coming out in March, and...
March 23rd, so that's pretty cool, wish it was coming out earlier than that, but whatever, I'll wait.
Other notable stuff, Mario Party 9 on the Wii, coming out March 11th.
Also, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond, on February 27th, also on the Wii.
Let's see, some other stuff.
They're also going to be getting some cool eShop stuff.
VVVVV for the 3DS will be coming out first quarter next year as well as Night Sky and Mighty Switch Force, Zen Pitball, and Mutant Mudds.
And I guess Kirby's Block Ball is going to be brought to the Virtual Console as well for the 3DS.
On WeWear, LaMulana is supposed to be coming out.
That's pretty cool.
Someone tell DT to keep it in his pants.
He's already well aware of LaMulana coming out.
He's on the pulse of LaMulana.
Rhythm Heaven, Fever that's coming out February 13th on the Wii that's also going to be $29.99 so a nice budget price for that honestly never got into those and of course the Circle Pad Pro will be coming out around that time
Alright, well before we get to the classic game of the week, I gotta share this story that's going around the internet this week, making its way on the gaming blogs.
A very interesting censorship issue going on on the Nintendo 3DS.
Imagine if you were Ashton Kutcher, and you tried to name your me on your 3DS, Ashton.
Nintendo apparently is censoring that name, believing that it contains...
and objectionable content.
Because think about it.
Ashton, if you spell it out, A-S-H.
Yeah, it sounds like a shit ton.
Or Aston, maybe?
I don't know.
So if you like Aston Martins, you can't have one?
I guess not.
So this poor guy named Ashton, I mean, it's not Ashton Kutcher, obviously, but that's a common use of the name where we would think like, oh, there are people named this in the world.
Because if it was Ashton Kutcher, that shit would be fixed.
Maybe...
Done.
Sorry, Mr. Ashton.
leave your take it or leave your so you can see this and he actually shows his me and then he shows what it looks like on his friend's system where it's replaced it with a bunch of question marks because apparently the name Ashton is objectionable now Ashton Kutcher I find objectionable but this poor guy who just happens to have the same name shouldn't have to suffer the consequence of Ashton Kutcher being crappy so
Man, wouldn't you hate to find out that Nintendo just suddenly deemed your name offensive?
It's stupid.
I'm offended by Rob.
Because I feel like you're going to steal from me.
It's like you're going to rob a bank or something.
Hey, well, it's good, though, that they, what is it, for the 3DS, they've patched it so that they can add DLC, right?
So does that mean they're going to be able to bug fix stuff like this?
Well, they have firmware updates.
They can do that in a firmware update.
That firmware update really did kind of, you know, it was like they changed everything in that console.
I mean, they overwrote some of the stuff in the Find Me thing.
They overwrote, it was a lot of changes.
So they can fix it if they want.
I know they can.
But they're not.
Not unless Ashton Kutcher tweets about it.
So somebody should send him that YouTube.
But they could do it, though, because remember there's issues with Street Fighter where it wasn't working correctly or Ridge Racer or something like that.
One of the launch titles was bugged or something.
Yeah, so they fixed that.
It's sad that... Because we're going to get into a story later on, but it's sad that...
Nintendo hasn't embraced the ability to patch games.
Right?
Stupid.
Alright, let's take a look at the classic game of the week.
I thought of it in my car.
Every week.
We'll see you next time.
DarkSakura, enough setup, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
Xavius
It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Namco and it came out in 1982.
You know what else came out in 1982, Rob?
What?
Tron!
Awesome.
It was a game done by Masanobu Endo and it was released by Atari in the US and it runs on the Galaga hardware.
By the way, I just have to say I find the background music on this to actually get kind of annoying.
I might have to kill it at some point.
In Brazil, the cabinet actually says Columbia for the game, but the software still says Xevious.
So you use an 8-directional joystick to move an aircraft called the Silvolo, which has a forward-firing zapper and a blaster that lets you send air-to-surface bombs down for ground targets.
And it's supposed to be set in Peru.
Ooh.
Um, so you have to basically just fly around and shoot shit.
It's a shmup.
You have 16 areas, and it loops back to area 7 after 16.
And, uh, you just keep going over terrain and shooting shit.
So if you complete at least 70% of the area before dying, then, um, like, when you die, then you actually will start at the next level instead.
It constantly flies forward, just like any good shmup.
You actually can make it through the whole game without killing anybody for the record.
Although, not really.
Where's the fun in that?
I know, right?
The challenge is not getting hit.
It is one of the very... I would have to put it in the first of the shmups.
It actually, an earlier one before that was Caverns of Mars on the Atari computer.
It was really, really cool.
It uses a lot of different techniques for it.
It uses palette shifting for color changes, and it's just really amazing.
It also had a few hidden bonuses in it that you could find by doing a secret maneuver.
One of them was a special flag from RallyX.
What happens if you find the flag, then you get an extra life.
It's in a bunch of Namco games.
And the slogan when this came out was, are you devious enough to play Xevious?
And then it says, the arcade game you can't play at home.
I'm going to play some of the music from the newer one.
Okay.
Well, actually there were pretty big music stars in Japan who were big fans of the games.
And one of them, who was Keisuke Kawata of Southern All-Stars, actually did an album that was all based off of Namco video games.
And Xavius was the centerpiece one.
And then...
There was also a 12-inch single that had liner notes and a science fiction story written by the creator Massimo Buendo that was set in the world of Xevious and had its own language included.
Um, there was also a three-part novel written about it called, uh, Fardrot, F-A-R-D-R-A-U-T.
Um, but the theory is that it doesn't sound like it was ever released, or if it was released, it was really limited release.
There were other games that came out in the series.
In 84, it was Super Xevious that was basically the same game, just harder.
And Solvelo in 1991, which was first-person, sort of.
It uses 3D flat-shaded polygons, and they only came out in Japan.
Xevious 3DG in 1995 was basically a 3D texture on top of polygons.
And two-player play only in Japan, although I've seen one.
Xavius Arrangement in 1995 that was part of the Namco Classic Volume 1 collection.
Also included Xavius and Super Xavius.
Grubda, which was a spin-off starring an enemy, a tank with corkscrew treads.
That came out in 84.
Also, new versions for the home system was Super VVS Gap no Nazo in 1986, which came out for the Famicom and the Nintendo Vs. I'm sorry, why is that?
Versus series in the arcades.
Basically, there's different riddles you have to solve to get through it.
There was VVS Far Dread Saga, which was an MSX2 game, and it was done by Compile.
Compile does amazing stuff.
You can actually pick from four different ships.
You have the Solvolo, the Solgrado, the Zeodali, and the Gamp Mission.
There's Xevious Fadrot Densetsu in 1990 that came out on PC Engine, also done by Compile.
And then Xevious Resurrection that came out in 2009 for PS3 as a downloadable, with the downloadable title Namco Museum Essentials.
Or it was called Namcomuseum.com.
Two N's in Japan.
There's also an RTS game called New Space Order that was done by Namco Bandai Games that has bits of Xevious included in it.
For different ports, we're looking at the Atari 7800, Atari 8-bit, NEC, PC Engine, NES, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Apple ST, Home Computer.
Everything!
Yep.
Re-releases, like I said, there was Namco Museum Vol.
2 for the PlayStation, which I have... The A. The Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade PC, 1998, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for Xbox, PS2, GameCube,
and PC.
It was not in the Game Boy Advance version, by the way.
Namco Museum Battle Collection for PSP, Namco Museum DS, Namco Museum Remix on Wii, Namco Museum Essentials for PS3, like I said earlier.
And it was also ported into the plug-and-play version of Ms.
Pac-Man TV compilation, the little plug-in thing.
There was also
A GBA release of the NES version on... It was an unlockable bonus game for Star Fox Assault and then came out on Virtual Console.
Like I said, there's just a bunch of them.
They tried to do a 2600 version.
It didn't come out.
It was part of Pac-Man's arcade party in 2010.
And 3D Classic ZVS, a 3D remake of the game, was available on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS.
There's a bootleg version, too, called Xevious.
X-E-V-I-O-S.
The U is absent.
Oh, that makes it a new game.
But really, it's just... All they did was, instead of saying 1982 Namco, it says 1980 Watson.
And they removed the Namco logo.
And... It's just...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and the explosion sounds are different as far as differences in the US and Japanese ones the names in the Japanese version are the pseudonyms of the games designers and composers and since the US basically let three characters in it didn't work and the zapper and blaster buttons were reversed between the versions
There's also references in Ridge Racer.
You get a car called the R.T.
Xevious Red and the R.T.
Xevious Green.
You get all three different versions of it.
In Ridge Racer 3D, one of the unlockable cars is called the Sovolo and it's piloted by Pac-Man.
Isn't that cool?
Very cool.
How about other references?
Star Fox Assault Tales of Symphonia Bakura Invincible Flying Panels Mario Kart, Arcade GP, and GP2 Namco
you also, one of Pac-Man's cars is the Sovolo spacecraft in Earthbound, music from Xevious can be heard at the Onet Arcade you can actually get the Sovolo ship as an avatar on PSN and it will be a downloadable aircraft in Ace Combat Assault Horizon there you go
Your classic game of the week, Xevious, and it's 50 gazillion different ports and reiterations.
I like this one.
I've never played this one, the 3DG.
I've never played that one, but it looks kind of fun.
You know what?
When I told Dan what I picked, he was like, Xevious is awesome!
It is awesome.
The other game that I picked, though, he was really excited about that, so I might have to do it next time.
All right.
Well, we're going to take a break.
We're going to do Mario Kart again.
We are getting in the OL Army room right now.
There's already five of us in there, including myself and Loki and Bobby Blackwolf.
So it's really... It's on.
And Tigerclaw.
So it's really like All Games versus Zether, who won last time.
So it's not looking good.
Team All Games has each other's back.
Dude, you are in trouble.
That's right.
You are screwed.
They're going to use a special turtle shell that just breaks out a paddle and spanks you.
Does Aether have a show?
Maybe he does.
I'm not aware.
Who knows?
Anyhow, if you have Mario Kart 7, hurry up and get in there in the OL Army room.
Quickly, write this down.
Get a pen.
Start punching it in.
40-5530-8176-7193 That's the OL Army Mario Kart 7 code.
Alright, we're about to get started while Lena Ha goes after a quick break.
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
And yes, we got our Mario Kart on during the break there.
It was weird because Zether took us to town both times.
He won both races.
So in Zether versus all games, Zether won.
So good job, dude.
And I came in third both times.
Loki came in last on both races.
Good job, Loki!
Yeah, it's because a fucking blue shell is hitting me in fourth place.
Blue shell stopped and then hit me in fourth fucking place.
but he's not mad or anything now what I find hilarious it's because it counted down I didn't even get the check set up my cart I got this like fucking terrible ass cart that I'm driving right now so I don't know I quit what course is that you guys are in right now this is one of the ones I don't think I've played yet Bowser's Castle and I'm not even my me is racing and in first place how sad is that my me does better when I'm not even playing laughing
So, anyhow.
Yeah, that was enough.
And Kaijudo in chat says, wow, that race must be epic.
This is a long time break.
We only did two races.
We had the Maple Treeway came up.
Oh, yeah, Rainbow Road from the original Super Nintendo was the first track we had to do.
Yeah, good times.
So Mario Kart 7 is playing on a break.
So we'll have to set up some more nights.
We've got to get more people to play Mario Kart 7.
At some point, hopefully, DarkSakura will get a 3DS.
She can join us in the Mario Karts.
Somebody buy me one.
Man, I'm looking at this thing.
These people are crazy.
What thing is crazy?
This family that builds a 100,000 brick Lego model every Christmas.
Did my Mii come in first?
Oh, no.
Zether still beat me.
That's sad.
My me.
You built a Dalek.
My me did better without me.
Alright, Loki, you gotta close it up.
We gotta get into some rapid fire news is what we're about to get into.
I have no idea how to quit out, by the way.
I just hit home and then hit B to quit.
Like, there's no, like, quit option.
It's like, you're stuck playing four races.
Fantastic.
Great, great menu design, Nintendo.
Fucking amazing.
Alright.
Yeah, we'll see.
Because I got the fucking cart.
It does not corner for shit.
Yeah, that's right.
Blame the cart, Loki.
It is the fucking cart.
It's the computer's fault.
It's the internet's fault.
Hey, we'll see next week.
Bobby's fault.
Hey, we'll see next week.
No, two weeks.
We're off next week.
Whatever.
All right.
Hey, maybe for Christmas, Santa will bring you some skill.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
All right, let's get into some rapid- A skill saw.
Let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
Skill of getting random power-ups.
Yeah, it must be fucking awesome.
By the way, two of those blue shells are mine, just saying.
4th fucking place suddenly I'm loving the blue shell suddenly I am loving it there's people in front of me I see them they're about to cross the finish line shell stops at me it's like what the fuck get over it if your cart can make it let's go alright let's see here so Humble Indie Bundle 4 has been released and it's got a lot of cool shit in it including Meat Boy Shank Jamestown Bittrip Runner
Night Sky, and of course also if you donate enough, Gratuitous Space Battles and Cave Story Plus.
Seriously, pay enough to get Cave Story Plus.
But this is an amazing deal, and if you have any spare money whatsoever, like I realize some of you are just like flat-ass broke this time of year, but if you have any spare money whatsoever, get this.
It's a great value.
I avoided lunch for a whole day to pay $6.
I'm not telling the listeners to starve themselves, but maybe one less McDonald's meal and a, you know, cook at home.
Make a sandwich at home, get some Cave Story.
There you go, exactly.
And then to top that off, also, you get free soundtracks for every single game in there.
That's included in the prize.
Including some of the music we played on break tonight for the live listeners.
So there you go.
So, pretty sweet.
On top of that, if you like UK developers, there's another indie bundle.
The UK Indie Games Bundle, or the Little Big Bunch, it's also out right now.
ExplodeMon, Oddworld Munch's Odyssey, Frozen Synapse, Serious Sam DD, New Star Soccer 5 GamesAid
Outro Music
and then there was a game called APB.
It was kind of like Saints Row Online or Grand Theft Auto Online if you will.
APB went freemium and now apparently they've been having some pretty good success over Steam and they're also going to release it as a box version that you can find in retailers.
For $29.99 you're going to get more than $50 worth of in-game items as well and
It's pretty awesome.
I guess the original game only had 130,000 registered players, but they've already picked up more than the original audience, so that's pretty fast.
That's pretty awesome, because a lot of people wrote that game off.
Yeah, they picked up 3 million new registered users.
Wow.
3 million after showing up on Steam.
And, you know, from what I played, very little of it.
It was pretty cool.
I mean, it's worth checking out because it's free, so why not?
All right.
Let's go to some other news.
Well, if you want to try VidRhythm, the good news is it's now free.
If you missed it the first time around, shit, go get it.
It's free now with 12 new tracks and a VidRhythm update 1.1 that happened this week.
There are some holiday songs, Deck the Halls, Jingle Bells, and apparently pitch correction now.
So now you can sound like T-Pain.
I don't know exactly how that works.
Six new video styles in there as well.
And, and, one more, you can export the clips in high definition now.
So VidRhythm had a pretty meaty update this week.
Very cool seeing Harmonix support it, even though it's more of a WTF kind of application, to be honest.
Holy shit.
What are you holy shitting?
VidRhythm?
No, a picture of me when I was 20 that one of my friends just posted.
Wow.
On Facebook?
On Facebook.
Look at my hair.
It was long.
Okay.
Sorry, I was just like, wow.
You used to have pretty big boobies back then.
I've always had an epic rack, Rob.
What are you talking about?
You know what's gonna suck is if I do get all knocked up.
They're just going to get bigger.
It's true.
You know, Zether might have the biggest Mario Kart e-peen, but you'll always have the biggest tits.
I do have an epic rack.
It's not a bad thing.
All right.
Alan Wake is coming to PCs in early 2012.
Even though the game's been on Xbox for quite some time, about a little over a year, year and a half, Alan Wake is supposed to be coming out on the PC finally in early 2012, which is interesting because...
I thought the game was originally supposed to be on both and then they said no it's not going to be on the PC well now it is actually coming on the PC both download content the writer and the signal they're going to be included in the PC version for free possibly to make up for a little bit of lost time interestingly enough this is time to be right around the time that the Alan Wake Xbox Live Arcade game or Alan Wake's American Nightmare is supposed to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade so kind of maybe trying to get the name out there a little bit again before the Xbox Live Arcade expansion
Connectimals is coming out on another platform.
It's coming out on iOS.
I think this is very interesting.
Maybe something we should talk about in a more extended segment.
But Connectimals is coming out on the iOS platforms.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
also you know why I think this is interesting is because there's been a lot of calls for Nintendo to do something like this right the investors really want Nintendo to be doing this and they've really staunchly refused but Microsoft has now shown that they're not afraid to do it now granted they get a little more out of it with the whole Windows phone tie-in
But, I mean, they put it out there.
It's kind of like they acknowledged, hey, if we don't put it out on iOS 2, we're selling ourselves short a little bit.
They kind of gave Windows Phone an exclusive window.
They put it out there first, but they kind of gave in and did the iOS system.
I just...
It's not like Microsoft and Apple doing things together is completely unheard of, right?
Remember the gasps heard around the world when Microsoft Word was announced for the Macs?
That was years and years ago when Steve Jobs first came back to Apple.
But it's still interesting, nonetheless.
Very interesting to see this happening.
Be curious to see if Sony or Nintendo ever does anything in a similar vein.
Anyhow, moving on, DarkSakra.
Wow, I found pictures of me when I was four.
Okay.
Aww.
I was a cute kid, damn it.
I'm still cute.
What happened?
Sonic CD on Xbox Live
XBOXLIVEARCADE.COM
Also, there will be the deal of the week, including Japan's Finest, which is Hardcore Uprising and Radiant Silvergun for $7.50 each.
Bangai OHD Missile Fury and Gunwage are $5 a piece, and Rock of Ages is down to $5 as well.
But everyone needs to get Sonic CD and Radiant Silvergun.
Yay sales!
I love the Japanese soundtrack for Sonic CD so much, but then again, it's just not the same without Sonic Boom.
And, oh yeah, there was other new shit.
Sorry, I was all, you know, excited over Sonic.
Sales and stuff.
There's a new Pokemon game that's a crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition.
What?!
Yeah.
It's true.
When I think about Pokemon, I think about Nobunaga's Ambition.
So do I. I always wondered, wouldn't these two games go great together?
Make the Pikachus go out and get the rice to feed the troops?
And a trailer.
And it's set for 2012 release on the Nintendo DS in Japan.
and I am going to post a link to this on our Tumblr Meanwhile the rest of the internet's like where's our new real Pokemon game?
I want Pokemon Fuchsia or whatever Meanwhile the rest of the universe shits their collective pants
That's it, that's it.
You know, I was going to mention, remember earlier I said that I don't like people sending me invites, or I'm not going to accept any invites that people send me for the SimSocial?
When the fuck does AOL Instant Messenger start posting on your fucking Facebook wall saying, I've been idle since blah blah blah time?
I don't fucking care if you haven't been doing something in another app.
So hide all that shit.
I want to make sure that shit's not happening.
You don't realize it's happening, you know what I mean?
You got to be careful.
Go through every now and then and check what apps have access.
Honestly, that's what you got to do.
Yeah.
All right.
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about Club Nintendo.
And this is kind of cool because actually I've never really registered stuff on Club Nintendo and I started yesterday.
So I had a bunch of these old games I just went back through, like Excitebots and shit like that.
So I just added almost everything.
DarkSakura.com
Virtual Console, WiiWare, and eShop Games, including this first round of games, either 100 or 150 coins.
For 100 coins on the Wii, you can get Super Mario Kart on Virtual Console.
This is only good until January 10th, so if you want to use that, then go ahead and do that if you don't have the game.
For the WiiWare, you have Fluosity, and that's 150 coins.
On the 3DS, or DS, I believe it's the 3DS, you have the 3D Classic Xevious for 100 coins, or Mario vs. Donkey Kong Minis March Again for 150 coins.
And it's neat, but yeah, there's not really...
I was kind of disappointed at the rewards.
Thanks for watching!
I'm kind of disappointed though that you can't and here's the other thing I don't like about the registering the games.
Yeah, it's cool that we registered the games but I don't like fucking filling out that survey.
Yeah, it's kind of like especially, did you notice how you get a damn survey for each and every stinking NES game and probably now the Game Boy Advance games are all going to have a survey on there too?
I kind of think it's a good thing to have some surveys.
They want to make sure that they're still releasing stuff of good quality.
So do you get coins for buying stuff on the eShop?
Yeah, if you do the survey on them I think you do.
I didn't have any surveys.
Well, I haven't purchased anything on the eShop either.
Yeah, check it out once you do.
I think they do get some stuff there.
Cool, they got surveys for the free shit.
By the way, the information is up on our Tumblr now.
The link to the Pokemon Plus Nobunaga's Ambition.
I love that Jigglypuff's on the cover.
She's going to sing the armies to sleep.
What is looking like to me, from what I can tell, is that every human character has a Pokemon partner.
I guess they're doing Digimon.
This one guy in purple armor has Mewtwo, and the girl, she's all in pink, she has Jigglypuff, and this one's got... So you see, and then I think whoever he is is the guy catching them.
I'd be more interested in the Dynasty Warriors Mario crossover.
Yeah.
Shut up Shut up
Well, you'll lose a lot more than 20 minutes if you hit this bug here.
Did you hear about this?
There's that Zelda Skyward Sword.
Apparently, you could catch yourself in some type of error where if you complete a quest in the wrong order and then talk to a guy, you can screw things up.
I don't know.
But apparently, Nintendo on the support page for Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword says you can actually send in your save file to be fixed.
What?
A Nintendo apparently will also be putting out a program that will repair the saved data if you have your Wii connected to the internet.
So it's like a patch, but not really.
So yeah, I guess you could catch yourself in some type of loop.
Because they can't patch.
Yeah, they can't patch.
But they're going to put out some type of fix.
So there you go.
You could send in your Wii and get your game fixed if you screwed up.
So, just, I would read the internet and figure out what you need to do to not screw it up.
Or don't try to break the game, because I think you kind of have to go backwards a little bit to make this happen.
So, I don't know.
All right.
We're going to now see if anybody can break our mailbag.
Mailbag at orangelauntradio.com is the place to send us emails every week.
DarkSakura, read some emails.
We have two.
Two?
Yeah, two.
That's a pathetic showing of emails.
I got my answer from the Consumer Protection They said they can't give legal advice even though they are under an Attorney General's office Then again, I didn't ask for legal advice, simply information Their answer seems to say that this is not codified in law in Maryland My advice for these nasty EULAs is if you feel the need to sue Microsoft or Sony is to first try the arbitration then dispute it if the settlement is unfair
I think you just got a form letter back, dude.
That sucks.
Okay, last email.
Sorry.
Hey, OLR crew.
So I hate to be the guy that sends you yet another silly YouTube link.
Okay, Rob, get ready to pull it up.
But I found this to be worthy of a quick watch.
Maybe my sense of humor is completely sick and perverse, but I'll be damned if the kids in Skyrim aren't annoying little bastards every now and then.
This just proves... Every now and then?
Every time.
Is this another goddamn arrow to the knee clip?
I don't know.
This just proves I'm not alone.
I think Loki in particular will get a kick out of this.
Okay, I'm linking it to Rob.
Hold on, I got it, I got it.
Is it from... Okay, I see it.
Here we go.
It's probably the Killing Children mod or something.
Alright, here we go.
It's called... Yep, Killable Children is what it's called.
So let's see here.
Ew, it's playing an ad.
I don't want to watch no ad with ugly people.
Alright, hold on.
Ad, ad, ad.
Well, grandma was a hottie dot com.
Yes, that's what the ad was for.
Now you know the type of stuff I watch on YouTube.
Okay, here's the real clip.
You shouldn't talk to strangers, little kid.
Gutted with a fire sword.
Oh, look, I just... I just killed a little friend here.
Look at this shit.
Why are they hurting each other?
Oh, shit!
I'll have your head!
I have your head, bitch!
Oh my god, that's terrible!
That's awesome.
I've seen this video before.
Are you trying to run away from me?
I didn't even know you could decapitate people.
Agnet, you rush the dragon.
I stay here.
I kind of want to go back and play Skyrim again and just kill everybody.
Be careful, Agnet.
I kick hands on the ground.
Wow.
Yes.
Sorry.
In all seriousness, though, I'm a huge fan of the show and have been listening for over six years.
I listen on and off throughout the week while working and you three managed to put a smile on my face no matter what the topic is.
Even if we talk about child killing, unicorn stabbing.
Decapitating their mothers Face melting I wanted to ask you how you have kept the show going on for so many years Alcohol
I have known countless groups, bands, organizations, etc.
that start off strong but lose steam and eventually die due to apathy.
How do you guys manage to push through and deliver week after week after week after a whopping nine years?
What keeps you motivated and do you guys ever have major disagreements or even fights regarding direction?
No, never.
You want to see the show go in the future.
Just want to see behind the scenes gossip for a rabid OLR fanboy.
Take care and happy holidays, Tonic Vision.
First of all, I'm never the same person every day.
It's because of my innate woman-ness that I will change personality all the time.
You never know which Pokemon she's carrying around.
Rob and I go to Disneyland.
That helps.
I honestly don't know how we've managed to do this for nine years.
It's funny you're asking this now because we had a pretty good scare this past week that it might end very suddenly.
There was a realistic possibility for a minute there that this could have been the last OLR.
I was still going to try the Skype thing.
No, it wouldn't have been the last OLR.
I know, I know, I know, but the last OLR as we know it, you know, and I have my issues with the Skype thing.
I know Horde House kind of does it, but, you know, just this show.
It's good enough for Horde House.
This show has worked because we haven't changed a lot since the first day.
Are you shitting me?
We've changed quite a bit.
But we've had nine fucking years to change.
But we've evolved.
Yes, we've evolved into Raichu at some point along the way.
I thought we were Jolion.
We slowly evolved into the whole general video gaming when we used to be about DDR.
The show had absolutely no fucking structure back in the day.
I had a migraine the first episode and was asleep in that chair.
If you listen to the first few episodes, we really would just be like, we're just going to kind of like fuck off for three hours and talk about topics because, you know, as much as I hate inflating Travis's ego on this show, that's kind of how I learned to do it on Understation Live is we kind of like had that same approach.
It was like, well, we know we're going to talk about XYZ tonight and somehow we'll do a show.
And it were I'm not knocking Travis at all.
He does a beautiful show.
And that's Iron Fingering.
Yeah, that's that's how I was raised, so to speak.
But at some point.
along the way when we made the switch into podcasting.
I think suddenly when we took a different approach in making the to-go edition and then suddenly it was like, okay, we've gone from having 50 people listen live to having 2,500 people downloading our podcast.
It was like, shit, something's working over here.
Maybe we should try mixing it up a little bit.
And it's kind of worked.
It's
and having the structure hasn't been such a bad thing but yes there's structure but there's still huge amounts of spontaneity and a lot of that is directed by you guys in the chat room and I hate to sound mushy yucky frilly fuzzy but the chatters to a big extent and our live audience and the interaction that we do get on the show is
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It was during the garage years.
I remember that.
And it was probably around that same time when Remember the Computer went down mid-show and I had the big diva fit.
I think not long after that I was ready to just fucking quit.
And within a short time of each other, we had the listeners chip together to buy a new computer.
And I got not one but like two emails that were very kind of personal in nature about like,
You know, just what I've kind of put out there on the internet being like kind of open about the fact that I'm gay and you know in a relationship and all that stuff and that it kind of gave some people that were struggling with coming out like hope and that like means like so much like I was just like floored and I was kind of like I fucking can't leave.
I'm in this too deep now.
They keep bribing us with food and games and happy things.
Inevitably, it'll have to end someday.
Nothing good lasts forever.
What else am I going to do on Sunday nights?
DarkSakura.com
Hey, we don't have the show tonight.
Let's go get Pinkberry.
And then we talk about the show.
Literally, the last time we didn't have a show, that's exactly what happened.
Was that the night the internet kept us from doing a show?
Yeah, so I was like... And we went to breakfast that day.
Because Dan was watching stupid football.
So we're like...
Let's go get Pinkberry later.
Yeah, which by the way, you need to work on that, girly, as soon as you get past all the other stuff.
One thing at a time.
I know, I know, but seriously, I need to talk to you offline about something because I don't want to say anything on air, but you need to work on that because people are making travel plans because I kind of let it slip to somebody.
Like, there might be something happening at such and such place at such and such time.
Really?
I'm booking my ticket right now.
Shit!
Now it has to happen.
Yeah.
because I can't let this person down.
Yeah, well, it's going to be a busy couple of months because also a mutual friend of ours is graduating in May.
All right, so go to their graduation.
Say, have fun in the real world.
Bye.
And then get back on planning the 10-year party.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
Alright, I guess that's kind of a big deal.
That's a big deal.
Alright.
So, um, but you know, I also think that part of it too is that just with how crazy, like, I know I lost my job, but you guys know how miserable I was before.
Mm-hmm.
You know, having this show gave me something to mark my weeks because...
I really was just like, what am I doing?
Oh yeah, I have this show.
And it really kept my level of consciousness of what was going on around me up instead of just falling into, I'm depressed.
A lot of stuff that's, like for instance, I got to go to E3 like five times.
It's coming up later in the show.
I don't know if I'll ever get to go again, but because of this show and some of the contacts I made and friends I made, I got to do that.
At least I can say I've been, even if I never get to go again.
You've got friends all over the world now?
Yeah, for real.
We can actually say our friends.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Which I do miss the New York crew, I will say that.
Not that I should be partial to one or the other, but I really do miss that group in New York.
I want to go hang out with Rob in England.
Heck yeah.
And Syl.
Oh my god.
I want to hang out with Syl so much.
So bad.
And then I want to raid with her.
We would party.
She's been doing her live streaming of the Star Wars.
It's kind of fun.
I love Syl.
But I want to go on a pub crawl with Rob.
I think we need to make a plan to go international at some point.
But anyway, I don't want to drag all this self love out.
And then we're going to go to Japan and sleep in Ikuma's closet.
I'm kidding.
My friend Krista lives in Kyoto.
I'll stay with her.
But seriously, you guys in chat are being so sweet right now.
She lives in Osaka.
Never mind.
Let me read some of these comments here.
DJ Dark Knight says, we love you guys.
Misty says, yes, sure me, no matter how much you want to deny it.
Bochikawa says, we love you guys.
Black Wolf agrees.
That's my thing.
My Sunday nights will be empty.
I've never not done a show if I'm not home.
The only times I cancel is if I'm not home.
DJ Dark Knight says, I have always considered you guys my second family and know I can turn to you guys when I need a pep talk.
See, it's stuff like that where it's like, how could it just, how could we just say, you know what, I don't feel like doing a show tonight.
and we've had those nights.
Trust me.
We've had those.
I don't fucking want to do a show tonight.
Fuck.
How about every time a new Harry Potter book would come out and all I would do is fucking read Harry Potter during the show and go oh girl did you just see that?
Oh you didn't because I'm reading it not you.
But then it's like
Anyway, I don't know.
I don't want to talk too long on this subject.
It's kind of like kissing our own butts.
I do have to, though, thank all the listeners for something.
You guys have been with me through some shit.
I got married doing this show.
I graduated college doing this show.
I've moved a few times.
I've gotten promotions while I've done this show.
I got laid off while doing this show.
I mean, big major events in my life.
Loki went through a lot too on the show.
And I moved a few times.
I've had the same fucking job for 10 years.
Well, you're Mr. Stability.
Well, but I can't complain.
I'm very happy with where I'm at in my day job.
And Shermie has pooped live on air.
It would have never... But he's such a sweet person.
It would have never come to that without this show.
He's so nice, and I was more than happy to do the work.
Which, by the way, guys, you'll get to see what it looks like as soon as we finish the move, because I'll be updating my portfolio.
Nice.
Umlaut was great.
I'm sorry I missed it the other years.
Last year I had a final exam that day.
This year my teacher let me get out of my group project and do it early.
That was cool.
He was like, that's a big event.
You go to that.
That's a big thing to you.
Also, one thing I have to say that I've learned a lot of skills doing the show.
You're a bitch, so fuck you.
You know what?
I was upset for like five seconds and then I just realized these people don't know me and the same skill works very well in real life.
We gotta move on with the show.
Loki, you've been strangely quiet.
You okay?
He's sobbing at his corner.
I was... I can get you an E3.
What?
I do love you, Loki.
What?
I said, I can get you an E3.
Okay.
Get me too.
This is what I love about Loki.
We'll be sitting here talking and reminiscing.
Loki's already hacking something.
On it.
I'm right on top of that, Rose.
All right.
Wow.
And if you know what movie that came from.
If you didn't just show the show's age right there.
No, I saw that in the theater.
Me too.
Can we move on?
We got a show to do.
Yeah.
I'm going to satisfy the listeners.
By the way, Loki, you're going to regret saying that on air because I bet you you're five seconds away from a private message from Bobby.
Anyhow.
Okay.
All right, let's move on.
The FUs of the week.
Oh, how appropriate.
After a fuzzy wuzzy cuddle hug fest, rainbows and sunshine, now it's time to bring in the rain.
Here's some rainbows.
Blow them out your ass.
Here comes fucking reality.
F you to jury duty when I gotta move.
I would rather move furniture than go to jury duty, but at least I have a good book to read.
I'm reading The Land of the Painted Caves.
You also have free Wi-Fi.
I brought a good book.
I'm bringing a good book that doesn't require Wi-Fi.
If you do happen to get stuck there, Wednesdays, you gotta go up to the farmer's market.
They have fucking awesome pizza there.
Okay.
It's delicious.
It was worth pizza.
I'm just gonna tell them it's Hanukkah.
I don't think it's going to work.
Damn it.
They'll be like, okay, or the judge will be Jewish and be like, well, it's not like it's Rosh Hashanah.
The judge will be like, Mazel Tov, bitch.
Loki.
PuggyDemarkCard7 for not allowing me to change my cart in between matches because that kind of sucks that you can't adjust that.
Or, for some reason, having a clear way to quit online.
Thank you for watching!
Oh well.
My FU of the week.
Oh God, where do I begin?
You know the old saying, when it rains, it pours.
And especially this time of year, it's just kind of a... It's a bad time of year.
But I'm really looking forward to having vacation coming up.
Because damn it, I earned it.
And I'm going to go to Disneyland.
And you need to help me move.
Deal.
What?
What?
Help me set up the studio.
Alright, that I can do.
If you'll let me set up video.
If it's not pointed at me Alright, you're on The listeners have been demanding live video We need to make their wishes come true So we'll work on it Alright, fine, I will help you tech out the new studio Alright, let's go back into some gaming news So we can get some calls here in a minute Loki I like that Darth Spazinator says If Loki can go one show without hacking something or ranting Someone should check to see if he has a fever or something
Yeah, I'm in hack mode all the time.
All the time.
He's hacking your life as we speak.
You mad?
Okay, so Capcom is releasing a Capcom digital collection.
It includes a bunch of Xbox Live Arcade games, basically.
It's coming out for $40.
And it includes 1942 Joint Strike, Commando Rearmed 2...
Final Fight Double Impact Flock, Rocketman Axis of Evil, and also with the DLC, it came from Uranus, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, and Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3.
All those available for $40.
Now...
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that one of those games, at the very least, I believe Final Fight Double Impact, required you to be connected to Xbox Live in order to play it registered.
I think that was PlayStation Network.
That was PlayStation Network.
They didn't have that on.
I think.
It's been a while.
Maybe this is where chat can help us out, maybe.
I can't remember, but I thought that would be interesting if it required you to play online.
That would be interesting.
Well, maybe they changed that.
Maybe.
But anyways, it's about $100 worth of games for $40.
So, good deal, I guess, if you don't already have them.
So I have at least a few of those.
E3 passes have doubled in cost!
And I know what you might be thinking, you might be like, wait a minute, you don't pay to go to E3, doesn't everybody go to E3 for free?
Like you register and you prove you're in the industry?
Well, yes, for the most part, most everybody you see at E3 got in there for free, because either they are tied into the industry, they are in the media as a lot of the people, obviously, they are in kind of like the, not just the gaming, the people that make the games, but the people that purchase the games, like Loki's industry, distributors, and all those people, retail, a lot of the folks that go.
DarkSakura.com
Expo Passes so to believe it or not this whole time you could really pay to go to E3 you could just say I'm exploring the industry or I'm a student wanting to kind of get into this or whatever and you can pay and the prices used to be let's see it was $400 was last year's price if you registered before a certain date and $500 if you registered at the door for three days you know it's expensive or you could say I'm Sinbad or
Or you could say you're Sinbad.
I got nothing to do today.
However, the news is this year those prices have shot way up.
They've doubled.
Now, it doesn't sound like they've doubled, but they've doubled.
Multiply them by two and then subtract five.
$795 before the deadline for a three-day pass.
$995.
You might as well say $1,000 for a pass to get into E3 after April 23rd.
So, I mean, that kind of sucks for people who want to explore.
Like, I'm not, I'm trying to figure out why E3 is doing this.
My thought is they're trying to maybe cut back on the people because there's some, you know, blogs and things have joked about this is that, well, you're paying all this money to wait in line.
And I have to agree.
Like, I didn't, well, we didn't, we didn't go to E3 last year.
Remember that, DarkSakura?
We went to E3.
We went into the lobby.
Yeah, we hung out.
We got freebies from the lobby.
People were kind of looking at us like, where's their badges?
But we didn't go into E3 itself.
But we were in the convention center kind of between the two halls.
And I held a DS street pass with people.
So we're just kind of like hanging out between.
And honestly, I don't feel like I missed much.
I mean, yeah, there were some big announcements.
Didn't you get a Wiamoto?
No, I didn't get Miyamoto.
I think Shane did.
So he got the Miyamoto.
Somebody did.
Maybe Bobby did.
But yeah.
I don't think it's worth that much money to go stand around and wait in line.
I mean, it would...
It would suck if you've gone all these years and then suddenly you can't go anymore.
I know Bobby's probably doing a lot of like, how am I going to get an E3 this time?
Because unfortunately, the media standards, they do this weird measurement where they're measuring your website traffic.
Well, if you're a show like us, they're looking for so many hundred visits a month, which we would hit easy on subscriptions.
We would easily hit, I'm sorry, they're looking for like thousand, but we would still hit that.
RSS feed
I don't know if it will work or not we'll see unfortunately the website fuck ups last month might damage that and I don't know but I don't know it's whatever arbitrary scale they want to use and I get what they're trying to do like it was so easy for somebody to just start their own website and get 20 of their friends in E3 under that website I feel like they did have to draw the line somewhere but I think they drew it too far out that us indie people kind of get fucked you know anyway
Vita!
We've got Vitamins.
No, actually not really.
What is going on with the Vita?
They are actually getting rid of the instruction booklet.
Guess what?
Apple did it first.
Neener, neener.
They're actually having digital manuals that you can access in-game for each of the games.
So it puts people like me out of a job that like printing.
Can you design online stuff?
Yeah, I could still do PDFs and everything.
I mean, that's not a big deal.
But they're basically going to be doing in-game manuals.
It's still kind of yucky, though.
I mean, I don't know.
I'm torn because it's like, how many times do I really read the instruction manual?
Well, it makes sense because they're already creating them anyways because they're offering all their games digitally as well as at retail.
So if they're already creating those digital things, why make them printed?
Yeah.
But then I think about back in the NES days, like the manual to The Legend of Zelda that kind of like told the story in the first few pages and so forth.
See, that was awesome.
I miss that kind of shit.
But I get it.
Like now, I don't really bother reading manuals.
I mean, look at Skyrim.
Skyrim came out with a fold-out map that's made to look like parchment and shit.
I mean, they still do that kind of stuff.
Like, I remember like my copy of Grandia that had a cloth map.
Mm-hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
That's true.
It just had a how to hook it up.
All in their bookstore now.
You can get a full manual in the bookstore.
But you don't need it.
There's a video of a three-year-old using one.
Sending text messages.
But I'm just saying, you know, it's not a new thing.
Cloud Cleveland in our chatroom says, gotta save those trees.
You know what?
For every tree that's cut down in the United States, three more are planted.
I have a feeling it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek, that comment.
I know, but it's not an excuse.
It's a cost-saving measure is what it is.
It's what it is.
Let's be real.
It's a cost-saving measure.
It costs money to print those books, and they decided they could save money on getting the game out there by just getting rid of the books and putting them online.
That's true.
I mean, I understand and I agree, but, I mean, it's putting a whole... It's the end of an industry of printing.
It's sad.
Yeah.
But, well, if you think about it, though, Jamie, I hate to say it, but a lot of printing industry is going digital.
I mean, look at... I love the smell of ink.
I know, but... And I think there will still always be demand for things like movie posters, advertising still big and all that.
But, like, look at things like, you know, the New York Times is on the frickin' iPad now.
And that's how people...
Get it.
But you know what?
I think the whole thing about the print industry in and of itself is it's turning more into a specialty market.
Because there are now, there's a resurgence of quality magazines, if you know what I mean, that are like artsy magazines that are like nice, thick paper and done in a certain size.
Those, and they charge quite a bit for them, but they know their market.
They're the people who are printophiles and...
Look at the stuff you had to do for Umlaut.
There's a lot of design shit that people don't even think about.
Somebody made the badges.
Somebody made the photo background.
Somebody made the flyers.
There's a lot of stuff.
I did the digital ones too.
There's also people who need to design game covers.
Do you need to do the layout on the back?
That's not going to go away.
That's why I get really irritated when people buy a nice expensive box set and then they just throw the boxes away.
Do you realize that someone put work into that?
Think of some of the great covers we've had in gaming like the original Mega Man cover.
Here's an example for you.
Remember Rolling Stone used to do the top 100 album covers of all time?
Do we have that anymore?
Do they still do this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, it's cool to have it digital because then you can have it in color.
You don't have to pay for a four-color process, which is expensive.
But at the same time, I think it's really sad.
It does take something out of an entire industry.
All right.
I would be the only one in this house that would go off on that.
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
And yes, I like the smell of ink.
Shut up.
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
But first, Loki.
Yes.
So let's talk a little bit about my favorite discussion topic, Skylanders.
And I've said it before, you know,
You guys are only encouraging them.
it's basically a world where you can go purchase a piece of the virtual skyland and customize it however you want along with a skylander character and i guess it's uh filled a bunch of different little mini games and stuff like that and they're gonna have constant updates to go along with it as well um
No word on integration though with the actual characters, although I would imagine that they're going to have something like that.
I see a button that says rental, so obviously they're charging for something.
But, I mean, seriously guys, I hear so many people going, wow, you know...
Thanks for watching!
Marvel vs. Capcom 3, when they were charging $6 per character for DLC, people bitched like crazy, saying, what the fuck, you expect me to pay $6 for a fucking character that was on disc?
Hey, you're paying $8 for a character that's on disc with Skylanders, and guess what?
You keep buying them, so they're going to keep releasing them.
So...
I have you guys to thank for that.
Thank you people that got all fucking nostalgic about it.
Because guess what?
When next Call of Duty comes out, you're going to be fucking paying $8 for whatever.
A gun.
You're going to get a little plastic gun.
I sense you're really upset about something.
It's just annoying.
People complain about the prices.
Why are they charging so much?
Why is there so much DLC for these games?
Why am I not getting only half a game and have to buy the rest in DLC?
It's because you're willing to pay $8 for a fucking plastic figurine that does nothing to play as a character in a game.
And not only will you buy one, but you'll buy tons of them.
Outro Outro Outro
I love Salacious Pop's comment in chat room.
If it didn't cost like $380 to do it, it would be awesome to hold an OLR drive to surprise Loki's tyke with a full Skylanders rig for Christmas.
What a cruel thing to do to Loki.
He wouldn't care.
He plays with spoons and boxes.
He tried to eat the toys.
Alright.
One more story for you guys here.
And it's about an online... Oh, you were done, right?
Sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
One more story for you guys here.
I was trying to get to Skyblind.
And it's about Need for Speed World.
Do you know Need for Speed World?
Do you remember this?
This is the Need for Speed online free MMO that they have, right?
Yes.
Dan was playing it.
Yes.
It's all right.
But there is now in this free game a special...
and Koniseg, Konikiniseg CCX Elite Edition car.
And it's kind of like, you know, you can buy it because usually like freemium games have things you can buy in them, right?
Well, guess how much this car will set you back?
$5.
$100.
What?
Oh, tons of people will buy it because, oh man, I've always wanted like a race car.
I'm going to get a race car for my online game because I will pay $100 for DLC.
Give me more.
It's all for profit, right?
Yeah, of course.
I'm looking at the actual press release here.
It says that there's the first premium elite car available to all Need for Speed World players via the in-game store for $100.
By the way, oh, get this, get this.
For a limited time until December 21st, you can get the super car for $75.
It's a 25% discount.
Well, shit, I'm jumping on that right now.
It's elite.
Elite.
This is like, you know, this is an interesting This is gonna make me burp This is an interesting trend in MMOs lately And god damn, I hope WoW doesn't go down this path Although I would say the $25 mounts are kind of pushing it And I have yet to buy a $25 mount $10 celestial steed right now I never Fuck that steed I know
But here's the thing.
Other MMOs have been doing this.
I remember Bobby was talking on his show.
He's dabbled in EVE Online, I think, or he knows people that are playing it.
And they had the whole Monocle thing that was being sold for like $60.
But some people, in order to really stand out in a crowd and have the biggest EPing, will pay that money.
I mean, think about it.
Why was there so much internet rage about people getting into that Star Wars The Old Republic game different times this week?
People were pissed that they weren't first, that they couldn't have the first level 50 character, although let's be real, nobody that was complaining about it is going to be the one to have that first level 50 character.
the person that has the first level 50 character is probably a group of people that are pushing their way to it just to have the biggest peen you know what I mean?
people will do pay anything to get ahead and have the biggest peen and I'm sure that thing sold quite a few cars probably not a ton but enough to make EA probably do it again which is sad
Remember that app that when the iPhone first came about and they had an app that was like $5,000 or some shit for a sparkling diamond thing that spun around and that's all it did?
Yeah, people bought that shit too.
Because they're dumb.
And, and...
I'd like to point out once again how stupid Skylanders is.
Take a look at this picture of Spyro from Skylanders.
He looks like he got fucking kicked in the teeth and some teeth got knocked out and he's like raging now.
I don't know.
It's just really stupid looking.
Where did his teeth go?
I mean, seriously, he looks so derpy now.
It's derpy Spyro.
Love it.
Derp bro.
All right.
Anyhow, that's going to do it for stories.
Now we're going to open up the Skype line.
You can give us a call.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Give us a call.
We will talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.
Maybe you have some news that we missed.
Maybe you've been playing that Star Wars game and want to tell us a little bit about it.
Or maybe you have some feedback on some of the things we talked about tonight.
While we're waiting for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters.
But I need to... God damn it, Tumblr is automatically posting to our Twitter again.
I thought I turned that shit off.
Oh.
I mean, not that I mind that people know that we have a Tumblr and everything, but it kind of sucks when they get like 50 updates during one show.
It's all right.
Did you see them?
Yeah, I saw.
I can see you over your shoulder right now, in fact.
All right, let's go to the Twitter topics.
It's twitter.com slash OLR while we wait for some calls.
And yes, we'll do some last minute stories too.
Oh, or we'll go straight to the phones because the phones are ringing.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Bobby from Atlanta, and I was wondering if I could get a weather report from the last place in the race.
Bobby Backwolf calling in to troll Loki.
I love it.
Yeah, yeah.
Nice, nice.
That's all right, Bobby.
Enjoy your win right now.
I just remember last week, you're like, we can't play him before the show because then all he'll do is cry during his show after I beat him.
I do remember that.
That was funny.
We just wanted to let you feel good tonight.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
And then next week we're going to really bring it.
Yeah, I'll be here waiting.
Oh, yeah.
Shit, we're not going to be here next week.
Damn it.
I'll be at home I'll bust it out after the show Maybe I won't be at home I don't know how long the family stuff is going I may not be at home actually, so I can't promise that But if I am at home, I will be on after Bobby Lockwell Yeah, and you know what I'll do?
Take a nap Did you just call in to troll Loki tonight?
Yes, but I do have other things I can comment on.
Like the E3 thing.
Yeah, yeah.
Tell us about the E3 thing.
You've been to E3, how many freaking years in a row?
18 years in a row or something crazy?
15 years in a row.
15 years in a row.
And I paid $75 to get the exhibits only pass in 97, my first year.
Oh my gosh.
So $75 for the three-day expo pass.
Wow.
It always has gone up and like 400 was a big jump because I think the last time I had paid I was like it was still like 150 or so to 200.
But what I think is going on is that they're really trying to keep people like me out.
because about half of my E3s have been free either through the media or through software development credentials or whatever.
And the other half have been free, and I always had that to kind of fall back on.
I'm going to kind of equate it to something that's – I don't know if they've got these type of toll roads out in California, but they just opened one in Georgia where they increased the price to dissuade people from using that lane.
E3 is trying to do the same thing.
They're like, well, if these bloggers that we don't feel have a right to be here are willing to pay the 400, let's see if they're willing to pay the 800.
and there are there is probably people that will say no that's too much and uh you know if they're not a legitimate business they can't write it off as a business expense or anything like that so what they're trying to do is they're trying to limit the amount of people that they don't think should be at E3 from still getting into E3 because that's been the dirty little secret is as long as you're over 18 you could pay and it didn't matter what your job was
Wow.
It didn't matter what you did.
If you gave them the money, they gave you a pass and said, have fun.
It just kind of stinks that some of us who have been trying so hard for so long kind of get the shaft.
There's some people that do get those numbers that kind of look down on the rest of us and say, well, just try harder.
But it's kind of like, well, it's tougher when they don't get what we're doing and that I'm not here to create a website.
Right.
I don't know if that makes sense.
but the individual shows themselves don't exactly have the website visitors unless they've got a vibrant community that they've built up and unfortunately our situation is kind of unique with the chat room and the live streaming and then the podcast and stuff and there's just they don't want to deal with it they already feel they allow too many media and so they're not going to change anything they do so I'm not even going to bother with the media pass this year but see what they've done to me
is the way I got in last year was through my day job because I'm a software developer and yes we actually do work on IOS stuff and I have done gaming exploratory stuff with my day job so technically I'm a game developer and that's usually good enough well apparently they've kind of updated their industry rule
and now they actually check your company's website to see if you publicly have ties to the gaming industry.
And since we don't have any completed projects, our website just talks about the real estate websites, which is our main revenue.
It says nothing about the gaming.
I'm still going to try to apply and send my W-2 and the tax ID and all the stuff that I need that I was eligible with last year.
I'm going to send it in, but they may look at the website and say you're not in the gaming industry.
Wow.
It's like they're paying all these people to investigate who's going.
I mean, I kind of get that something's got to give because the show has a lot of people there.
Yes.
There are a lot of people that shouldn't be there.
Right.
But in order to keep them out, they also have to get some of the people that probably do have more acclaim.
Because a lot of the companies there do believe I should be there, but it's not up to them who gets invited to E3.
It was at one point.
Yes, and I got in those years.
Funny enough, my first E3 was thanks to Friends of Konami.
Yeah.
So it's... In fact, DarkSakura could say the same thing, I think, and for a couple years was kind of that way.
It got in through DDR.
Well, because we were all doing DDR-oriented stuff, and Konami was really pushing those games when they came out those years.
So they definitely wanted to see us there.
But it's... And we were there the year Beatmania launched in America, and obviously they knew that that would be a big thing.
We tried to get the word out, but unfortunately it just wasn't its time.
So...
So, I mean, and that's what it is.
And I'm not going to sit here and QQ over, you know, not getting in to go to E3 or something or it being a little bit too expensive or something, you know.
But it does, you know, from a personal level, it does kind of suck because I've gone every year.
Right, right.
It kind of sucks to lose that.
And there are people that I see there that I only see once a year.
and to me E3 is more about the people and not the games I actually talk to more people and network more than I actually play games unless it was 2007 when only 3,000 people were there and I actually played a lot more games what's going to happen to our Disney trip?
I don't know I'm sad remember we went to Disneyland with Bobby this year at E3 that's why we went to E3 we went to pick Bobby up
I wanted that to become a new tradition.
Maybe I'll just have to book a ticket out to Sacramento sometime.
We'll just go hang in the convention center.
We'll take you to Fairytale Town.
I need to actually clue you in on what's going on for the 10th anniversary or what we're trying to plan.
Because I just realized I haven't told you yet.
It would be awesome if you could make an appearance.
But if not, totally understand.
It's expensive.
Actually, the only expensive part would be a hotel room.
But if I didn't need one of those...
We can work something out.
It's gonna be somewhat local.
I really have to watch my mouth because nothing has been sealed yet.
But Jamie's gonna work on that real soon.
When she's done with what's worrying her now.
Yeah, see, I know, I know.
I'm on your side, Jamie.
In the New Year.
Thank you, Bobby.
All right, well then, Bobby, that means I need to hang up on you now.
All right.
All right.
Take care.
Take care, guys.
Loki, get some practice in.
All right.
Stop trolling.
Bye, Bobby.
He hung up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, he gets one lucky race and then all of a sudden...
Yeah, see how fucking good you are without those fucking items.
Yeah, we'll see where the real racing is, but that's all right.
Bobby, for what it's worth, you guys, I know we plug him a lot, but if you're not listening to Bobby Blackwolf, he really works hard on his show, and it's a great show, and it's kind of like a... I always kind of call it like an NPR-style show, because it's just him talking about games, but, you know, you can hear his voice when he talks to us there.
He has a great radio voice, and, you know, he really kind of thinks about the topics he's going to talk about, and so he's kind of able to sustain the show himself, and...
Catastrophic Moggy Catastrophic Moggy
A long, long way away.
I'm in the UK.
Oh, my gosh.
Yay.
It is way past your bedtime, young man.
Talk about it.
It's five in the morning.
Oh, my God.
Well, thank you for staying up late listening to us.
Good heavens.
Well, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
There's a couple of things.
Your really big bundle is actually the Indie Royale, and they have the Xmas bundle up now.
Mm-hmm.
which includes the Blackworld Trilogy Remastered Eats, Dino D-Day, and the Oil Blue, just in case you're interested.
Also, going back a little bit about the peripheral for the 3DS, Nintendo have been doing this for years.
Remember the N64?
They had the memory expansion slots, which also you needed for Zelda.
Oh God, the horrible one.
Majora's Mask, yes.
Yeah, that.
So Nintendo have been doing this for a long time.
Mhm.
That's true.
Nintendo always just kind of put out these extra little things and then suddenly the game requires it later on.
That's very true.
Nothing new for Nintendo.
They did the same thing with the... What the hell was I talking about earlier?
Wii.
Wii with the Wii Motion Plus.
Did the GameCube do anything like that?
I don't think the GameCube did.
I think that's the one system that kind of stayed consistent.
I don't remember.
They had those WaveBirds were awesome, the wireless controllers, but that's all I can think of there.
It just seems every generation will try to do one thing.
They had the Game Boy Advance cable, but there were so few games that used that.
Didn't they have like a network thing?
Yeah.
Phantasy Star Online used it.
That's it.
Maybe one other game.
Mario Kart Land.
That was the warp pipe or whatever it was called.
That was a terrible, terrible thing Nintendo did, putting that out there and then just never using it.
You know, Katastroph and Moggy, since you're calling in from the UK, I've got to say it.
You must kind of laugh when we bitch about how we're having to wait all this time for Xenoblade to come out over here.
Because Nintendo's been fucking over you guys for years with their releases, huh?
That's one of the weirdest things.
Who'd have thought Nintendo would ever release a game here first?
Except, you know, maybe Tingle.
That Tingle RPG.
I don't think we ever did get that Tingle RPG, did we?
No, you didn't.
I don't think so.
That's sad.
It's tragic.
Loki had it pre-ordered and everything.
Oh yeah, totally.
Did he have his pre-order for his costume as well at the same time?
I wish.
I wish.
Yeah, and unfortunately they cancelled that too.
I'm sorry.
It sucks.
Shame.
Talking about that though, the funny thing is you're talking about manuals.
In the UK though, I mean you said Japan gets better manuals than you, but in the UK most of our manuals have always been black and white, even when you get nice colour manuals.
We just get cheap black and white ones.
You get the 7 cent copies from Kinko's whereas we're having to deal with the color ones.
That's great.
Man, you guys have been getting this shaft on your releases for years.
Why is that?
Why do you guys have to wait and then you don't even get the nice manuals?
The probable reason is because Europe has a lot of languages.
That's true.
We usually get really thick manuals with
10 different languages also in it.
A few pages for English, French, German, blah, blah, blah.
You know what's interesting?
Even here now, all the Nintendo games usually have their manuals in three languages.
English, French, and Spanish.
And I'm assuming that's because they do a lot of big North American region launches, so they have French for the Canadians and Spanish for the Mexicans.
But it's just interesting.
Yeah.
Just trying to save money.
I guess, I guess.
One last question though.
I remember a few years ago you were going to do a Euro, a Europe show and it got cancelled at the last second.
It did, and we ended up starting the marathon show we did a couple months later at noon.
Are you ever going to plan another Europe show?
Staying up this late is not good for my health.
I think we're going to have to.
At our friend's request, we're going to have to do another UK show.
We need to do another marathon show.
I'd be absolutely thrilled to.
We did mention a little bit about maybe we should do something earlier in the day on New Year's Eve.
May... Wait, no, we're not doing a show New Year's Eve.
It's New Year's Day.
New Year's Day at this moment.
No, so we want to do a show later.
Trust me.
Yeah.
Well, because I'll be hung... No, I don't get hungover.
But we were definitely... We had talked about it.
We definitely wouldn't mind trying something like that again if the schedules work out.
Yeah, I'd love to do another marathon show at some point and do more of like the live gaming and playing the games.
So sometime in 2012 for sure.
Early 2012.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Because I want to be sure that I have this thing about placing accents.
So do you live in the north?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I do.
Awesome.
Well, it's either north or south.
Well, no, because I sort of place it not like way north, but more like in the mid-north-ish area.
Whereabouts in the UK are you?
Yorkshire.
Okay.
Which is sort of in the middle, almost.
Look at you, accent guesser.
I watch a lot of BBC, thank you.
All right.
Well, when we come out to Europe and do our international show, you're going to need to come drinking with Syl and Rob and Picaruno, I have to add to that list.
That is if you can get me to not try to run off to Cardiff to see if I can be an extra on Doctor Who.
Oh, stop.
All right.
Certainly.
We'll have to tie you down.
All right.
No, my TARDIS!
Take me to the future!
And it dematerializes before your eyes.
All right.
Castarvamagi, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.
But thanks for staying up late.
Good heavens.
Thanks.
Bye.
Have a good one, buddy.
Bye.
I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight.
I'm so sorry, guys.
I am proud of myself.
But we're after midnight on the East Coast.
I haven't done Twitters either, and we've got to do last-minute stories.
So I'm going to quickly, quickly run through tweets.
So we're going to go do tweets here.
Oh, God, where am I going to start off here?
Okay.
Let me see.
I've got to screen this story first because they don't say anything on this.
Okay, we got a tweet from Cloud Cleveland that links us to a story on ScrewAttack.com that talks about Game Gadget System wants to be iPod Gaming.
Oh, this is kind of neat.
It looks like somebody's changed a typical iPod to put a little...
GameGadget 1.0
Thanks for watching!
set the appropriate pricing and gain incremental revenue, but with no additional investment.
Oh, okay, so I get it.
So it's not actually like an iPod.
It just kind of looks like one with its plug-ins and stuff, and they're just trying to build like an app store for games.
It would be interesting to see if they get the buy-in, because I don't know if they're going to actually get the buy-in on that.
Okay.
Alright, I need to reopen the Skype line because I just realized there is one more call I promised we would take tonight and I totally slipped my mind amongst everyone else.
It's Rob's mom!
No.
No, it's an important call.
Oh, I can't go, hi Rob's mom, you're on the show.
No.
Ah, wait, I'm not back on Skype yet.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's see how bad the ferret is today.
Not that bad.
Actually, you know what?
Fuck it.
I'll just call him.
Oh, there it is.
Never mind.
It's coming in.
Hi!
Hey, sorry Ranma.
As soon as you sent me the IM, I was like, shit, that's right.
I said he could call in tonight because he has something very important to talk about.
But amongst all the crazy stuff going on, our goodbye to the studio and all the other stuff, I just slipped my mind.
I'm sorry.
Bro, it's okay because in regards to what I want to talk about, when you were talking earlier about how you guys talk about everything besides video games and how...
were there for you like a big family.
It kind of hit home like a good thing, so I was cool with that.
Okay.
All right.
Well, thank you.
Now, you actually kind of called in tonight to not really talk about games or something gaming-related, but something just flat-out important to you.
Yeah, because I bring this up because we're independent podcasters, but we're also friends, and we always try to look out for each other one way or another.
So...
About a month, month and a half ago, one of my cosplaying friends, she goes by the name of Callie Rogers, she was hit by a car in LA and she was in a coma for about a month or so.
As to my information now, she's back home in DC and she's going through some rehab and from what I'm hearing is she's getting a lot better.
A couple of friends of mine, oddly enough both named Jesse, decided to help do something about it because with the rehab and all this, and it comes with medical bills.
So we're having a fundraiser and a donation drive.
So if you go over to AnimeJamSession.com, there is a button on the right-hand side of the page called Donate to CaliCat.
The first link is to Jesse's Auctions.
So if you are into anime and cool stuff like that, there's a lot of anime paraphernalia up there that's signed and autographed by producers and directors and voice actors.
That's awesome that you got their buy-in into that.
That's great.
Yeah.
The other friend, Jessie, she has a donation link set up as the second link.
So if you don't want to bid, but if you want to just give straight cash, you just click right on that and it goes right through.
That's awesome.
Well, I am sorry to hear about the situation, but most importantly, I'm glad she's getting better.
I mean, that's the most important thing.
So am I, because I haven't spoken to her in a while, because how it is, you're close-knit for a while, people kind of go separate ways, but when something happens, everybody comes back together to look out for each other.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
So give us the way to donate one more time.
Because it's not just like you can go straight up and donate cash and I am going to see what we can do on behalf of OLR in that regards.
But you can also kind of get, you can bid on these auctions and get things too.
So one more time, how can we help?
Why does that t-shirt have to be so expensive?
Damn it.
Are you looking at the stuff right now?
Yeah, Mythbusters t-shirt.
I know, everybody's going after that.
Especially in light of the recent cannonball.
I'm not talking about what you do in a pool.
Alright, so one more time.
Just head on over to AnimeJamSession.com The button is on the upper right hand side of the page and that's going to be there for as long as I'm running that site.
And if you really can't donate or bid on one of the auction items I just ask that you click on that link which will take you to a blog page
where you can just copy paste the information and put it on your site.
So try to get it out there so more people can see what's going on and help the best that we can.
All right.
Help somebody you need, especially this time of year.
Oh, definitely.
Good luck.
And we are all thinking of your friend and hope she makes a full recovery very soon, but very glad to hear she's on the way.
That makes two of us.
Alright, well Ranma, take care and sorry again that I cut it off before you could get through.
Hey, it's cool.
No problem.
It's past your bedtime.
It's past everybody's bedtime and I haven't even finished Twitter topics.
I'm waiting for you guys to finish so I can go have Hot Pockets and eat and watch TV.
We're trying.
Last show of the year.
We gotta make it big.
Hell yeah!
Alright, bye.
Alright, now I am closing Skype.
AnimeJamSession.com Check out the podcast while you're there if you're in anime.
I know he wants to be humble considering the situation, not really promote the podcast, but he can promote both.
Alright, quickly, let's try to close out some of these tweets.
I gotta say, a couple tweets about the Xbox Live call earlier.
People in the same situation.
This one from SSJ100Matt.
This story on OLR just now scared me into changing my Xbox Live account's password to email address to it.
Change yours or you might get screwed.
I say it, but good advice.
At least you know you're going to be better off.
Also from SSJ100 Matt, here's an Ask Orange Lounge Radio question.
Which is better?
Waffles, pancakes, or French toast?
Rank them.
It depends on where they're from, but I will take my favorites of all.
Okay.
Number one is the French Toast at Sam's Kosher Style Deli.
You've had it.
I have.
It's epic.
Number two are the Banana Cream Waffles at Charlie's that's across the street from my neighborhood.
And number three, I guess IHOP Pumpkin Pancakes.
Loki's?
Pancakes would definitely be dead last.
That's a toss-up between waffles and French toast, because it depends where you go.
Actually, in its own category, it should be Waffle House.
Waffles, just saying.
For me, waffles are way up here, number one.
Waffle, waffle, waffle, way up high.
And then below that, pancakes and French toast.
I gotta rate French toast last.
I'm sorry.
Don't get me wrong.
It's still good, and I'll never pass on it.
Unless I'm not feeling well, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They need to have some sort of unholy turducken of like pancakes, waffles, and french toast.
You know, where you like take french toast and like... Like the Monte Cristo of breakfast food?
Yeah, you like take french toast and you maybe like put some waffle batter around it or something.
We begin with french toast made of challah and we stuff it with a crispy waffle filled with pancake.
I love Salacious Pop's comment in chat.
What the fuck is this Sophie's Choice shit?
Agree.
Think how it feels for us.
Sterlok says this is a tweet.
Vita shuts out the blind.
You can't use the buttons in the menus, therefore making the system completely unusable for us.
Really?
I'm trying to think now.
See, I haven't seen the Vita or look at the interface at all.
So I know he's talking about it looks like bubbles blind.
Is it because since you can't use the tangible buttons and obviously a blind person can't see the touch screen or know where to touch, that's why they're screwed?
Because you can't use the tangible buttons.
Well, that's messed up.
Sony needs to think about everybody.
Hopefully in a patch.
I mean, I have seen handicap accessibility happen in patching.
Not that that's going to be a great answer for right now because that doesn't look good for the U.S.
launch.
But, hey, you know what we say, buddy.
Vote with your wallet.
If you can't play it, don't buy one.
Alan is telling all about you.
Ooh, what?
Oh, that I eat waffles with nothing on them.
Yeah, I like plain.
I was like, tell me.
I do the same thing.
I burn them to a crisp and then I eat them.
Fuck yeah, burn.
Oh, so good.
But you know what I've been doing lately, though, is just screw any sort of utensils.
You just pour a stack of four waffles.
You pour syrup on the top, a ton of syrup on the top.
I don't even like syrup.
Oh, I love syrup.
I hate syrup.
And Jemima's stuff, man.
It's fucking good.
It's not that I don't like it.
Peanut butter.
It's just too much.
Like, why...
Peanut butter waffles are fucking good.
I do like all that stuff, don't get me wrong, but it's just, you know, especially after I got sick a few years ago, I feel like I can have the taste of it without adding all that stuff.
But I'll tell you what, there's one thing that is perfect by itself.
Waffle House chocolate chip waffles, extra crispy.
They are like eating a giant cookie.
Alright, I gotta get to a couple fast, fast tweets from Tigerclaw, because these are some big stories we missed.
Skyrim Online mod adds co-op.
This seems huge to me.
Yeah, but it's not even close to being done.
Well, yeah, it's still in an early alpha state, but it makes you wonder, why doesn't Bethesda do something official?
Maybe they will in an expansion for the game, I don't know, but it's called Skyrim Online.
The release notes are at SkyrimNexus.com
Right now there's no animations.
You just kind of see people floating around as their naked prisoner.
But they're working on it.
Yeah, they're working on it.
Right now they have chat and they've got, you know.
Right.
Some of that.
All right.
And let's see.
I got another tweet from Tiger Claw.
Namco Bandai trademarked Alien Confidential.
What the hell is this game about?
Yeah.
Who knows?
Who knows?
Seven aliens are forced to live in a house.
It was trademarked files on December 12th in North America and Europe.
I'm assuming this is an E3 reveal and probably not a...
Probably not a... I don't know where I was going with that.
I was making a bad joke.
It's getting late.
My brain's malfunctioning.
Help.
That's it for tweets tonight.
Last minute stories.
Atlas is teasing something on their Twitter.
They're giving hints to a new game announcement.
The first hint was it starts with G, the second hint was that it ends with an R, and that it's a strategy RPG.
People are thinking that it's Gun... was it Gunner?
They confirmed it's Gunjiner, or whatever that one is.
Yeah, Gunjiner.
That's the one it is.
Yes, of course it's what it is.
They haven't confirmed it yet.
They haven't made the official announcement yet.
Wednesday is when they're making the official announcement.
Oh.
Oops.
Well, I mean, everybody knows what it is.
It's like, come on.
I thought I read that from Dark Tetsuya, not you.
Well, I mean, they're saying, I mean, they're teasing that's what it is and everybody, they haven't come out flat, come out and said it yet because they will on Wednesday.
But yeah, that's what it is.
Atlas is publishing it, of course.
Looks interesting.
It will be for the DS.
Or PSP, I'm sorry.
PSP.
Telltale's doing a new series, Law & Order Legacies, for the iPhone.
It's coming out on PC and Mac next year.
It's kind of cool because I've watched a hell of a lot of Law & Order.
Very familiar with Olivia Benson from SVU.
And actually all the other ones.
I dig all the series.
So they'll be coming out.
And that's pretty much it.
Eh, I'll do it.
It's good enough.
All right.
Well, we've gone very late tonight.
It's been a long, epic show.
Thank you guys so much for staying up late with us and listening to us.
It's the part of the show where we've got to close up and get everybody's final thoughts.
Loki, we'll start with you.
Final thought of the year.
We never really did like an end of the year special where we picked our game of the year.
I guess we'll have to do that our first week back because we will have a show on New Year's Day anyway.
I have one already.
Well, let's wait.
Hold off on it until New Year's.
All right.
So your final thought, Loki.
my final thought is I need to work on my modding stuff because I have like 4 or 5 mod things in progress I have a screen here where I started doing code for Call of Duty Mario Warfare Stupid Skyrim keeps taking me away from it and now Mario Kart and then Grand Theft Auto modding holy crap haven't done that in forever
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
Fucking jury duty.
My final thought tonight is there's nothing wrong with drinking the soda without a straw.
Good lord, Alan, leave me alone.
It sometimes tastes better when you don't drink it with a straw.
Thank you!
See, Loki, this is why we get along.
See?
Amen, Dan!
You rock!
The jokes write themselves.
Yep.
And on that note... Bye, kids!
That's the note we're going to go out on here on 2011.
Have a wonderful week.
Thanks for tuning in.
If you enjoyed the show, please tell other people to listen to the show.
We really appreciate it.
Have a great night.
Good night.
