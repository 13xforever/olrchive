Weh.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600

01:34.600 --> 01:35.600
Weh.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
Weh.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600

Weh.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
Weh.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
Weh.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
Weh.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
Weh.

01:46.600 --> 01:52.880
has been down due to some stuff and things. We'll leave it at that. And out of our control.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.520
And some folks have been working very hard behind the scenes. Namely, and I want to give

01:55.520 --> 02:00.640
a shout out to, Jason and Dekeman, behind the scenes, have ensured that it will be back

02:00.640 --> 02:04.280
up. Now here's the thing. I could flip the switch right now and some people would see

02:04.280 --> 02:08.160
it, but it's one of those things that's going to slowly roll out. The way DNS works out,

02:08.160 --> 02:13.480
it's going to slowly roll out the internet over the next 24 hours. But exactly. So that

02:13.480 --> 02:19.240
also keep, you know, keep in mind that if they do pass that law to block stuff, you

02:19.240 --> 02:23.240
have 24 hours to finish pirating whenever you may want to pirate.

02:23.240 --> 02:27.920
Stop. All right. But, uh, anyhow, the, and, and it's all worked out behind the scenes.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.240
We're going to have our backup site updated and the new site, so everybody will get the

02:31.240 --> 02:34.600
show and we'll have a website again. Yay. You better watch out though. If they catch

02:34.600 --> 02:38.400
you, um, pirating anything, they can actually just lock you up in a maximum security prison

02:38.400 --> 02:44.800
for no reason. Why are we talking about this? I'm trying to be happy about the show. Coming

02:44.800 --> 02:50.940
back for the show. Yay. Ah, party. All right. Anyhow, orange launch radio.com by the time

02:50.940 --> 02:55.460
the podcast, the people download this in here, it's probably back up and running live listeners.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.240
You're finding out about two minutes after I did. I said, I said you all would be the

02:58.240 --> 03:02.800
first to know. So as soon as I hit that switch, which I'll do when we're on break, cause right

03:02.800 --> 03:06.760
now try to do a show. Why are you showing me up your sleeve? I'm, I'm looking at my

03:06.760 --> 03:11.320
fake watch. Even though we are not televised, I'm still going through the motions and looking

03:11.320 --> 03:18.440
at my fake watch. Anyhow. Um, what else was I going to say? Damn you woman, you threw

03:18.440 --> 03:25.240
me off. Um, chat.orangelaungeradio.com. It does work. It's up right now. Even on the

03:25.240 --> 03:28.520
backup site for the folks listening live, we do encourage you to join our chat room

03:28.520 --> 03:34.500
at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen live and make comments all you want,

03:34.500 --> 03:42.120
such as, uh, Jim Sally in our chat room says 24 hour pirate special at olr.com. You can

03:42.120 --> 03:48.520
get lots of booty at orangelaungeradio.com. All right. Um, yes. What? You get that look

03:48.520 --> 03:51.740
on your face. Like I have something smart assed. I'm going to say, yes, but it doesn't

03:51.740 --> 03:55.360
fit into the conversation that we're having right now. I'll save it. Does it ever fit

03:55.360 --> 03:59.640
into the conversation we're having right now? It's unfortunately a week too late. So a week

03:59.640 --> 04:04.280
too late. Yes, it is a week too late. All right, now I have to know what's your week

04:04.280 --> 04:13.400
old joke. Say it. Well, the Xbox luba has a slick interface. No, that's still funny.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.320
Xbox lube jokes are still funny. It's just not funny to some people listening who haven't

04:17.320 --> 04:20.560
been listening to the show lately because there's no damn website, but there will be

04:20.560 --> 04:28.520
anyhow. All right, look, I want to talk about other exciting things. Not only is our website

04:28.520 --> 04:32.160
coming back up, but um, there's an awesome charity event. We've pimped this on the show

04:32.160 --> 04:38.120
for years. There's an awesome charity event happening this week, this Thursday in San

04:38.120 --> 04:41.880
Francisco. So if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, you need to go to this event because

04:41.880 --> 04:46.360
I'm going to be there. Dark soccer is going to be there. Loki, not going to be there,

04:46.360 --> 04:50.520
but he'll be thinking about it. I'll bring some cat hair with me so Shermie can be part

04:50.520 --> 04:54.940
of it. I'll totally be thinking about it while I'm playing Skyrim. The moment I said that

04:54.940 --> 04:59.140
Shermie looked up at me like the hell you will. But here's the thing, dark soccer and

04:59.140 --> 05:04.320
I are going to San Francisco and um, salacious doesn't call. We don't honestly just pop anymore,

05:04.320 --> 05:09.500
but Alan is going to be very honest, you know, had, you know, had I not been locked into

05:09.500 --> 05:14.880
the house, you know, by the wife and kid, I probably would have been one that, uh, the

05:14.880 --> 05:18.900
be on the stage thing, you know? Oh yeah, I know. Be true to the rock band cause I like

05:18.900 --> 05:22.060
winning eBay auctions. So you know, well let me, let me back up for those that don't know

05:22.060 --> 05:25.500
what Loom loud is cause I know we've talked about this for years on the show. We're very

05:25.500 --> 05:28.840
grateful to have an audience that's listened to us for like some people in chat room mentioning

05:28.840 --> 05:32.000
early. I've been listening for five years. I've been listening since it was single digits

05:32.000 --> 05:36.020
in the show. Um, we've been pivoting this for a long time. It's a great charity event.

05:36.020 --> 05:39.520
It happens in San Francisco at a place called the DNA lounge, which is an actual venue and

05:39.520 --> 05:43.240
there's, there's a lot of famous stuff that happens to DNA lounge. Um, club booty is one

05:43.240 --> 05:46.840
of the biggest examples of that. That's the mashup club night where they actually like

05:46.840 --> 05:51.720
mash songs together and some of those huge mashups song things that you hear out there

05:51.720 --> 05:57.200
have come out of that club. By the way, on Thursday before Loom load, uh, club booty

05:57.200 --> 06:00.160
is going to be spinning for an hour. So that's kind of cool. So that's, that'll be a part

06:00.160 --> 06:05.200
of it. Um, but anyhow, what happens to Loom loud is people pay money, they get on stage,

06:05.200 --> 06:10.100
they play rock band in front of a crowd full of nerds and people have like minded mindset.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.980
So everybody gets into it. Everybody's drinking, everybody's having a great time and it's all

06:13.980 --> 06:18.060
for a great cause. They collect money at the door. It's 10 bucks to get in. Um, and that

06:18.060 --> 06:22.340
money to get in not only gets you into this awesome event, which is really worth it alone,

06:22.340 --> 06:27.440
but you get to pick a prize off the swag table. And I'm not allowed to say what I know about

06:27.440 --> 06:32.520
the swag table this year, but there's like really good stuff that people are going to

06:32.520 --> 06:36.440
walk out of there with just for walking in the door and deciding to go to this event.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.520
And they're going to be doing a raffle. They're going to be doing these silent auctions. I

06:39.520 --> 06:42.160
don't think I'm allowed to say what's at the silent auction. I don't know what I can and

06:42.160 --> 06:45.080
can't say, so I can't say anything and staring at their badges that are really pretty, but

06:45.080 --> 06:49.760
I will say, but I will say this, this, the silent auction stuff is amazing too. Like

06:49.760 --> 06:56.520
one of the items in particular. Oh my God. Oh my God. Anybody that like grew up on an

06:56.520 --> 07:00.640
NES is going to lose their shit over this. It's amazing. So, and I, I can't remember

07:00.640 --> 07:03.600
if that's one of the eBay ones or not, because yes, you're going to be able to participate

07:03.600 --> 07:08.000
online as well. And you'll be able to bid on this stuff online and, and, and the so-called

07:08.000 --> 07:13.520
you're going to get to watch it online. It's all streaming at umlaut.org. And why am I

07:13.520 --> 07:19.200
pimping this so bad? I'd be pimping it anyway, but I'm especially pimping it because there's

07:19.200 --> 07:25.400
a live pre-show for the first time ever. That's going to be happening video from it. And they

07:25.400 --> 07:31.080
asked me to co-host. So I'm going to be doing it with, um, uh, some other friends in the

07:31.080 --> 07:34.760
gaming community, including carnage, who does a lot of the Destructoid live stuff, uh, which

07:34.760 --> 07:38.440
would be very cool. Some other folks from other websites are involved too. So it's no

07:38.440 --> 07:43.680
like singular website doing it. This is not an OLR show. It's just, we're helping. We're

07:43.680 --> 07:47.440
one of the cooks in the kitchen with this. So, and it's going to be great. Um, met a

07:47.440 --> 07:52.360
lot of the folks earlier this weekend at a pretty cool place. And, um, yeah, it's, it's

07:52.360 --> 07:58.120
going to be a kick ass show. So make plans to be here Thursday, six 30 Pacific nine 30

07:58.120 --> 08:03.800
Eastern. Um, loud. That's U M L O U D.org. Now you have no excuse not to be there. It's

08:03.800 --> 08:07.860
going to be delivered to your house. I'm also selling autographs on people's foreheads for

08:07.860 --> 08:13.560
10 bucks. Don't spend dollar donations. Why not put it in the donation box? I'll sign

08:13.560 --> 08:17.480
your forehead. You know what? If you're, if you will donate $20 to the cause, I'll make

08:17.480 --> 08:21.880
out with you. No, I'm just kidding. Video camera. Only if you're hot. No, I'm just,

08:21.880 --> 08:26.760
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But we will, I, we are going to lend our full support and

08:26.760 --> 08:31.520
if that makes you as an OLR person want to come party with us, you know what? We'll have

08:31.520 --> 08:34.560
a drink together. I can say at least that much. Yeah. We're not really going to make

08:34.560 --> 08:41.000
out with you. No. Okay. And dark soccer will not show you her boots. No, but, but I am,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.080
um, the designer this year. Um, I will not say much more than that, but you get to see

08:47.080 --> 08:56.440
my work on the badges and the tickets and a wall and other things. Good stuff. So yeah.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.240
And as part of the video presentation, you're going to get to see me, which is a little

08:59.240 --> 09:04.240
creepy because I don't do video. Like I've done, you can see my work on that too. I've

09:04.240 --> 09:10.640
done, uh, audio stuff since 97. So this is one of the first, I mean, besides back when

09:10.640 --> 09:15.000
we were doing the Justin TV, like webcam pointed at us as we were taping the show, which I

09:15.000 --> 09:18.280
don't think makes her exciting video, but some people miss it. Maybe it'll come back

09:18.280 --> 09:24.920
someday when we're at a studio that's wired for it. Um, but uh, yeah, I, I, I'm excited.

09:24.920 --> 09:31.080
I'm into it. I'm, I'm, I'm happy. You look perky. Yeah. It's been, it's been a busy week

09:31.080 --> 09:35.200
and I've just had that coffee right over there. That coffee right over there that no one can

09:35.200 --> 09:39.040
see, but us and websites coming back. I don't know if you heard, but it's very exciting.

09:39.040 --> 09:45.440
I was going to get some red bull before the show, but I have a Pepsi and as of at night,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.960
my night couldn't get any better. Look at this. Look at this. My buddy, my pal Loki

09:48.960 --> 09:54.080
tech master Loki brought me saints row the third on Xbox three 60 granted to borrow,

09:54.080 --> 09:59.000
not to keep, but when I borrow games from Loki, I keep them for like three months. So

09:59.000 --> 10:03.840
you completely forgot that I got you a very special present today, mister from the dollar

10:03.840 --> 10:13.780
store. I got Robin snow globe. It was the thought that counts. I waited in line twice

10:13.780 --> 10:20.080
as long as I spent shopping. All right. I hate the dollar store this time of year. All

10:20.080 --> 10:25.160
right. Uh, going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge, radio.com salacious pop

10:25.160 --> 10:30.780
in our chat says Rob Roberts is going to be the next Adam Sessler. At least he's a little

10:30.780 --> 10:40.000
balder than me, which isn't saying much. Anyhow. All right. Uh, look, it's not, it's not about

10:40.000 --> 10:44.320
that. It's about getting you guys to show up. They, they know this is the thing. They

10:44.320 --> 10:48.920
know that the OLR and that the all games people are rabid people and they will wear when we

10:48.920 --> 10:53.780
will do this stuff, they're, they're more likely to show up. So you guys have to represent

10:53.780 --> 10:58.960
not just OLR, but all games and show up and cheer loudly and be excited about them loud.

10:58.960 --> 11:03.800
And most of all, please donate. I know, I know it's a tough time of year, but, uh, keep

11:03.800 --> 11:07.760
in mind the charity. There's a lot of kids out there who have it a lot tougher and we're

11:07.760 --> 11:11.640
going to bring a little bit of sunshine to their lives through this charity. So again,

11:11.640 --> 11:18.920
um, loud.org on Thursday. Alrighty. How about video games? Let's get back into how our gaming

11:18.920 --> 11:21.920
weeks were and all that good stuff. We always like to kick off the show a little bit. How

11:21.920 --> 11:25.320
was your gaming week? Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? I played stuff that wasn't

11:25.320 --> 11:31.680
well. That made me played well too. But last night started the family tradition. We broke

11:31.680 --> 11:37.760
out the Saturn and played Christmas nights. Oh, it must be the holidays. And then we realized

11:37.760 --> 11:42.200
that our battery wasn't working so we couldn't save anything. But Dan decided that he was

11:42.200 --> 11:47.500
going to play Ray Earth anyway, so he started playing Ray Earth. I finally played my copy

11:47.500 --> 11:52.720
of P.O.P.O. 2 on the Sega Saturn. And you know what? That game sucks. Not that it sucks

11:52.720 --> 11:58.180
that it's a bad game because P.O.P.O. is awesome. It kicked my ass. I am that out of practice

11:58.180 --> 12:06.440
on P.O.P.O. And we played through, um, Parodius Da. We played through, um, G.K.O. Parodius.

12:06.440 --> 12:14.640
Um, sorry. Sorry. Gokugio Parodius. Um, we played through, um, a little bit of, uh, Oceberry

12:14.640 --> 12:21.320
Parodius. A lot of Parodius. Um, Dan, we started playing through Rockman X3 until we realized

12:21.320 --> 12:27.560
that it actually is not all that great on the Saturn. Um, and then he beat, uh, Thunder

12:27.560 --> 12:32.760
Force 3 on Saturn. Like, just sat down and played. There's apparently something called

12:32.760 --> 12:37.560
kids mode, where if you die, you come back with all of your weapons and shields. So he

12:37.560 --> 12:43.700
was just doing stress relief mode pretty much. Um, we played, I played actually, um, some

12:43.700 --> 12:50.240
of the Blue Seed RPG until I forgot that I need a walkthrough to play the Blue Seed RPG

12:50.240 --> 12:55.880
because I read, like, a retarded five-year-old in Japanese. You had quite the Sega-filled

12:55.880 --> 13:01.040
retro week. There's more. Oh my. I found my Utena game. I didn't play it. Was that the

13:01.040 --> 13:06.000
Dish game? No, no, that was on Dreamcast and that was Cardcaptor Sakura. I can never remember

13:06.000 --> 13:10.800
these things. But there was Clamp involved because it played Rayearth. And, um, I was

13:10.800 --> 13:14.040
gonna play Pocket Fighter, but I was like, I don't want to deal with the RAM card or

13:14.040 --> 13:22.560
anything, so. And, um, also, um, I bought Dan's present. Don't tell him anybody. It's

13:22.560 --> 13:30.520
b-b-b-b-b-b. That's what Dan got. I'm not gonna repeat that. No, I'm not gonna tell

13:30.520 --> 13:33.840
anybody what I got, Dan, because they'll tell him because of freaking internet. People can't

13:33.840 --> 13:44.200
keep a secret. What's up with that? Um, and then, um, I bathed the cat. That's a game

13:44.200 --> 13:50.840
all in itself. Uh, that's just, see what offended faces Shermie can make at you. She's asleep

13:50.840 --> 13:54.160
in her bed now, but she doesn't- She does look cleaner. She's a lot cleaner. She doesn't

13:54.160 --> 13:57.680
smell like her ass anymore. That's a good thing when she's right underneath me. She

13:57.680 --> 14:02.980
doesn't smell like Old Lady anymore. Alright. I'm sorry, but Shermie smelled like Cat Old

14:02.980 --> 14:08.760
Lady. Uh, comments from chat.orangelandtrady.com. ActDeft in our chat room says, it's officially

14:08.760 --> 14:13.440
the holidays at Jamie and Dan's house when they play Christmas Nights. That is true.

14:13.440 --> 14:19.520
Uh, let's see. Misty says, woo, kid mode. Sounds good for me. Right? Preach it. I also

14:19.520 --> 14:23.200
have to say, I also have to say that while I was in the kitchen making hot chocolate

14:23.200 --> 14:30.700
last night, that Dan was, um, the, the little night song was playing and I remembered the

14:30.700 --> 14:35.080
whole thing. I was singing along with it. The other thing I remembered the whole thing

14:35.080 --> 14:39.040
of, oddly enough, is how to sing the opening theme to Blue Seed in Japanese. You know why

14:39.040 --> 14:44.320
that is? What? Because you're a nerd. So, I love this song. It's a cute song. Alright.

14:44.320 --> 14:48.840
Loki, how was your gaming week? Did you play any, uh, old school Sega? I too broke out

14:48.840 --> 14:54.920
the Sega, uh, Saturn to, uh, to play Hanukkah Nights. It's not quite as popular as Christmas

14:54.920 --> 14:59.080
Nights, but, uh, but there's eight stages, eight stages since a little longer. Um, so

14:59.080 --> 15:08.480
it was, it was pretty good. Um, no, actually I, I played, uh, lots of Skyrim and, uh, ran

15:08.480 --> 15:15.200
across my, uh, fair share of glitches. Um, one of which I took a picture of for prosperity

15:15.200 --> 15:22.760
on, uh, Facebook. This, uh, I fought a dragon and all of a sudden it froze for a second.

15:22.760 --> 15:29.480
And then this giant, like, dirt thing was in front of me. I mean, we'll have to post

15:29.480 --> 15:33.880
it to the, uh, Tumblr, but I don't know if you can see, Rob, there's a little guy standing

15:33.880 --> 15:37.760
down here. Just to give you an idea how tall this thing is. It's just ridiculous. It's

15:37.760 --> 15:44.760
like an old faithful made out of dirt. Yeah, pretty much. And, and it is completely non-solid.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.360
You can just run right through it. Cause it's like, ooh, big mountain that it created. And,

15:48.360 --> 15:55.520
uh, it's weird. That same dragon, apparently the dragon of glitching, um, today I was playing,

15:55.520 --> 16:00.040
all of a sudden these dragon bones fall from the sky and just lands in front of me like,

16:00.040 --> 16:05.880
wait, this is that same dragon I just killed like hours ago, days ago. It just fell from

16:05.880 --> 16:11.520
the sky again. Uh, it's so glitchy. I haven't touched Skyrim in a couple of weeks just because

16:11.520 --> 16:15.380
of everything else that's been going on this time of year, but, um, I really need to play

16:15.380 --> 16:21.840
it more. God fucking chat. What, what did Chad do now? They're making assumptions. So

16:21.840 --> 16:26.640
I just said it. You're dirty. So, um, yeah, I mean, I've been, and I haven't really been

16:26.640 --> 16:32.120
doing anything. I actually had to force myself to go to the next like actual quest or the

16:32.120 --> 16:37.640
storyline quest. And, um, but along the way, of course, I had to like waste a bunch of

16:37.640 --> 16:44.320
time and went back to Helgen and picked up everything that wasn't attached to the ground

16:44.320 --> 16:49.840
and stored it into a, you know, a night table. Apparently those night tables have, uh, some

16:49.840 --> 16:55.400
sort of magical properties that you can store just everything in them. Like, you know, eight,

16:55.400 --> 17:00.520
you know, great swords. Yeah, sure. Why not? You know, armor, tons of it. Comment from

17:00.520 --> 17:05.320
Kaijuto in our chat room. Is he playing Skyrim on 360? I'm not getting many bugs on the PS3.

17:05.320 --> 17:10.800
I got a dragon flying backwards today. That's about it. Uh, yeah, 360. I was playing on

17:10.800 --> 17:16.000
PS3. I didn't notice any bugs really. I'm playing, um, still on the last patch, the

17:16.000 --> 17:21.960
one one because I'm not dumb enough to download one two. I'm just like, nope, I'm not going

17:21.960 --> 17:27.840
to download that. I, I like having magical resistance and stuff like that and my dragons

17:27.840 --> 17:35.360
flying forward. Um, so I've been playing, um, that and then actually I'm setting up

17:35.360 --> 17:40.760
my J tag to play once I'm done, how many hours it's going to be once I'm done with everything.

17:40.760 --> 17:47.520
Go back and play it using a hacked version because there's a way you can, uh, port over

17:47.520 --> 17:53.360
the PC mods to the 360 version if you have a J tag, which is fantastic. And so you can

17:53.360 --> 17:57.480
do a bunch of cool things with that. Um, of course I'm not doing that right now. I'm actually

17:57.480 --> 18:02.180
just playing legitimately. Although, like I said last week, there's a lot of weird situations

18:02.180 --> 18:07.040
where you do a quest for somebody and all of a sudden they start trusting you with their

18:07.040 --> 18:12.120
belongings, which is never a good idea because I, I started selling some firewood back to

18:12.120 --> 18:17.720
one of the ends or whatever and for some reason all of a sudden all the things that were steel

18:17.720 --> 18:22.840
were no longer steel and so I cleared out the entire place of everything that was not

18:22.840 --> 18:28.000
steel. And so now they, you know, people eating, I'm taking your food, you know, and just all

18:28.000 --> 18:33.160
sorts of fun stuff like that. Awesome. Um, Hey, you helped him out. What's theirs is

18:33.160 --> 18:39.880
yours. Exactly. And then I sold it back to them, which is great. Um, you can do some

18:39.880 --> 18:44.000
mean things in Skyrim. There's some like really funny stuff. Like I went to this one Fort

18:44.000 --> 18:47.600
and all these bandits are running around. There's this old woman and she's like, I come

18:47.600 --> 18:52.320
with the Fort and you know, there's people coming and going. I don't know who's taking

18:52.320 --> 18:56.520
over one side wins, the other side comes back and blah, blah, blah. So meanwhile, all these

18:56.520 --> 19:01.840
bandits are attacking it and I'm attacking them. And she's like, I think you should leave.

19:01.840 --> 19:09.880
And it was hilarious. I'm like, I'm going to kill you bitch. Keep like fucking talking

19:09.880 --> 19:14.920
to me. And then she finally, she's still there, but you know, now the Imperial forces are

19:14.920 --> 19:19.600
there. And this is hilarious because she's like, yeah, these people that have captured

19:19.600 --> 19:26.840
her, she's just like, I think you should go like, well, no, I'm not going to. You know,

19:26.840 --> 19:32.600
the thing Skyrim obviously is, is doing amazingly well, you know, and it's a single player game

19:32.600 --> 19:36.960
and everything. And I noticed a lot of what makes single player games really transcend

19:36.960 --> 19:40.480
into the mainstream that everybody's talking about them because I think of a game like

19:40.480 --> 19:44.300
grand theft auto four or grand theft auto three, which while granted they do have their

19:44.300 --> 19:47.520
multiplayer modes, they're probably more known for their single player. I think these games

19:47.520 --> 19:53.400
that have these huge sandboxes available to just do whatever always seem to be very memorable

19:53.400 --> 19:58.200
stuff that the people create in the environments. Part of the reason why you really love saints

19:58.200 --> 20:03.360
row too is that, you know, it's, it's a very absurd sandbox. It's somebody pooped in the

20:03.360 --> 20:12.080
sandbox and it's, it's still has its own microcosm. Yeah, I really do. I'm probably going to go

20:12.080 --> 20:16.720
back to saying it's row again cause I was looking at Tim. I, I don't have all the achievements

20:16.720 --> 20:22.200
yet. I'm almost there, but I just haven't, I really hated doing the, um, car theft missions

20:22.200 --> 20:28.280
and so I didn't. And then I also have to replay the game as a, you know, a female character

20:28.280 --> 20:32.760
for at least two hours and get that achievement. Um, and then I have to finish some of the

20:32.760 --> 20:37.520
other story missions in a different way than I did before. But you know, it's almost at

20:37.520 --> 20:40.680
the end. Uh, the other thing I played this week also was called duty, modern warfare

20:40.680 --> 20:45.600
one, you know, call duty four. Uh, we went, now we're in sibling, just regular free for

20:45.600 --> 20:49.360
all death matches. We're going old school free for all death matches, which is kind

20:49.360 --> 20:52.320
of a little bit like grand theft auto death matches where you start off with the same

20:52.320 --> 20:56.200
weapons and you pick up weapons and perks as you go along. So it's kind of fun just

20:56.200 --> 21:00.360
mixing it up a little bit, but I'm still working on the mod game. Uh, eventually the problem

21:00.360 --> 21:05.000
is so it's like every time I'm like, can I go work on the mod game or I can play Skyrim

21:05.000 --> 21:09.960
and usually Skyrim where it wins out, you know? Yeah, I know how it goes. That game

21:09.960 --> 21:16.360
literally it sucks hours of my life away and I do nothing in it. I collect shit. I hoard

21:16.360 --> 21:22.760
it all. Your wife pretty much hates reading books. She doesn't care. The only thing I

21:22.760 --> 21:27.040
heard out of her like yesterday was, Oh, that's pretty, you know, cause you know, it's the

21:27.040 --> 21:31.080
environment and stuff. It is pretty, but like, you know, I, I attacked a mammoth the other

21:31.080 --> 21:36.920
day and stuff. I killed a couple of bears today. Yeah, they're pissing me off. Did you

21:36.920 --> 21:41.760
find the cave of bears? Yes, they did find the cave of bears. Yes. I don't know if it

21:41.760 --> 21:44.440
was, it's right outside one of the quest towns. There's actually, it's a place, it's called

21:44.440 --> 21:50.120
like the bear cave or something like that. It's nothing but bears. There was two bears

21:50.120 --> 21:54.200
in a cave that I found. I don't think it was that. It was on my way to, I don't remember

21:54.200 --> 21:58.600
the damn town names. It's been a while. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anything else for your week

21:58.600 --> 22:02.560
you want to share? Uh, that's it. All right. Um, my gaming week, actually not quite as

22:02.560 --> 22:07.240
exciting as my co-host this week. I'm kind of the one with the lazy game week. Um, uh,

22:07.240 --> 22:12.440
I wanted to get Mario Kart seven today, but I neglected to order online and now that I'm

22:12.440 --> 22:15.720
trying to order it online, they're like, we can't deliver it till after Christmas. I'm

22:15.720 --> 22:20.920
like, screw you. Um, I want it now. I was literally next door to an evil G today and

22:20.920 --> 22:24.360
I still didn't want to go in. I'm like, I'll wait till I'll go to target later in the week.

22:24.360 --> 22:29.080
So yeah. Uh, no Mario Kart seven for me today, but um, I will get it this week. Just things

22:29.080 --> 22:31.960
are a little bit crazy right now. As you can imagine with everything I talked about earlier,

22:31.960 --> 22:36.240
prepping for Thursday and, and just everything else going on with my day job is nuts right

22:36.240 --> 22:40.700
now. Um, there hasn't been a whole lot of time. I will tell you what little time there

22:40.700 --> 22:45.140
has been. I honestly truly have been spending on world of Warcraft because with good reason,

22:45.140 --> 22:49.100
a huge content patch hit this week. The dark moon fair. Yeah. The four, three patch hit

22:49.100 --> 22:54.180
this week, not just dark moon fair that started the other night, but the five man instances.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.180
There's a new raid and now they have this whole new looking for Ray tool. So if you're

22:58.180 --> 23:02.820
not even in a guild that raids regularly like mine kind of raids like half the time, um,

23:02.820 --> 23:06.260
you can do this whole thing where you can raid now. So it's, it's great. There's a lot

23:06.260 --> 23:10.000
of stuff you can do there. So my time has been kind of sucked away into world of Warcraft

23:10.000 --> 23:16.460
and I talk more about it on this week's Horde house. That's the other show I do. www.hordehouse.com

23:16.460 --> 23:23.100
check it out. Just posted earlier today. Um, so yeah, uh, other than that, I bought some

23:23.100 --> 23:27.620
other games this week. I just haven't played them yet. I bought another one of those bundles.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.960
It's not the humble indie bundle cause it wasn't really for charity, but it was another

23:30.960 --> 23:34.940
bundle and uh, you'll have to forgive me. I forgot the name. Somebody in chat, I'm sure

23:34.940 --> 23:38.680
will yell it out, but it's the bundle that had Cthulhu saves the world. It's like a big

23:38.680 --> 23:43.260
something. Yeah. And then it had, it had a really big world bundle maybe. Yeah. It had

23:43.260 --> 23:48.100
a really neat sounding game in it, which between that and the Xbox live indie games that I'd

23:48.100 --> 23:55.200
played before, I knew it would be worth it. Um, it was, um, like poker mixed with puzzle

23:55.200 --> 23:59.340
game mixed with RPG. It sounded really cool. So I wanted to play that. I just didn't get

23:59.340 --> 24:04.440
around to it this week because again, new wow patch, busy day life. So it'd be awesome

24:04.440 --> 24:09.860
if it's swords and poker for the PC, but they didn't. It is not swords and poker PC. So

24:09.860 --> 24:14.440
that was another game took over my life. Our chat is kind of lagged tonight, so I can't

24:14.440 --> 24:19.840
even get the answer for them. So we'll see. It'll come up in a little while I'm sure.

24:19.840 --> 24:25.240
So the problem with those indie bundles, it's like I'm not buying anymore until I play the

24:25.240 --> 24:32.060
one that I have and I've only played one game out of it. You know, VVVV. Um, I still haven't

24:32.060 --> 24:37.400
played all the other ones out of that Humble Any Bundle. Um, so yeah, it probably will

24:37.400 --> 24:41.580
be a while before I buy any more of those. Actually it was looking a little bit on Xbox

24:41.580 --> 24:46.620
indie games because I have a bunch of Microsoft points that I haven't used yet and I thought

24:46.620 --> 24:51.240
about buying some stuff. I almost bought DLC quest, but then I was like, how often would

24:51.240 --> 24:57.240
I really play this with Skyrim and Saints Row and stuff? So it'll be something I purchase

24:57.240 --> 25:01.760
later on. All right, thank you guys. Thank you chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.560
It was, uh, Indie Royale was the website that was selling it and it was the really big bundle.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.880
It's done. That was a quick sale unless I just got in on the tail end of it. I don't

25:10.880 --> 25:17.480
know, but it's done. So unfortunately you can't buy this now, but um, let's see. Unless

25:17.480 --> 25:22.160
maybe you can. Now the current minimum is done. It says or beat the minimum. I don't

25:22.160 --> 25:26.520
know what the minimum is. I don't know if you can still buy it, but again, you look

25:26.520 --> 25:29.960
down here and it says one minute, five seconds ago they were still selling it. So I don't

25:29.960 --> 25:35.960
think you can. Well, let me try for dollars. Go see if it'll work. But anyway, the, uh,

25:35.960 --> 25:40.040
it had, um, breath of death. Cthulhu saves the world. The game I was trying to think

25:40.040 --> 25:46.100
of rune spell overture. That's the other game in the bundle that I wanted to check out.

25:46.100 --> 25:49.600
So there you go. And sadly it doesn't look like the website's working anymore. I think

25:49.600 --> 25:57.780
it's done so can't get it now. All right. Um, chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you want

25:57.780 --> 26:04.800
to join us here live on this Sunday evening and you can help fill in the gaps of my memory.

26:04.800 --> 26:09.840
Awesome. Some other things we want to plug. You're old, right? I was talking about this

26:09.840 --> 26:13.120
earlier and you were like, no, you're not old. It's like, no, I'm forgetting things

26:13.120 --> 26:18.760
left and right. All right. Um, couple other things we wanted to mention before we get

26:18.760 --> 26:24.600
into tonight's news. I want to plug some other stuff that we're on around the internet. Twitter.com

God there will be a mailbag again next week. Um, hopefully as well if we're getting the

26:56.040 --> 27:00.840
old website back, so that should be up midweek or so. All right, let's get into some gaming

27:00.840 --> 27:06.840
news. Loki's going to start us off with some gaming news tonight. Yes. Um, so lots of stuff

27:06.840 --> 27:11.840
coming out about the PlayStation Vita. And of course one of the things that people are

27:11.840 --> 27:17.520
wondering is how much are those proprietary memory cards going to cost us? Of course it's

27:17.520 --> 27:24.520
going to be something reasonable, right? Right. Right. No. Um, actually no, they're, they're

27:24.640 --> 27:31.640
pretty, pretty, um, high priced. Uh, let's see here. Or as you might say, not reasonable.

27:32.040 --> 27:38.480
Yes. Not reasonable at all. Um, apparently they're saying that the according to GameStop

27:38.480 --> 27:43.980
or the evil G if you will, uh, they have it listed on their website that the four gigabyte

27:43.980 --> 27:50.520
card is going to be $29.99. Although they have, um, I guess Sony has told some websites

27:50.520 --> 27:55.640
that the four gigabyte cards that actually retail for $24.99, uh, eight gigabyte cards

27:55.640 --> 28:01.680
for $39.99. But, but I'll have you know, there have been times where the evil G will sell

28:01.680 --> 28:06.120
stuff over retail because an uninformed consumer will buy it for whatever price you have it

28:06.120 --> 28:14.120
listed for. Um, so beyond the four and eight gigabyte cards, the 16 gigabyte card will

28:14.120 --> 28:23.640
run you $69.99 and 32 will be $119.99. Um, why is this important? Because they're required.

28:23.640 --> 28:29.300
You need to have a memory card to play your games for the most part. Most games require

28:29.300 --> 28:34.480
the memory card and especially if you're looking to download anything, you have to buy a memory

28:34.480 --> 28:39.640
card in order to do that. And it's proprietary so you can't just, you know, get an SD card

28:39.640 --> 28:44.480
or something like that, which would be way, way, way, way, way cheaper. But you know,

28:44.480 --> 28:49.120
hey, if it's not proprietary, then people can pirate with it, right? That's what their

28:49.120 --> 28:53.720
fear is. Or they're going to hack the system somehow. I tell you this much, Sony, they're

28:53.720 --> 28:59.480
going to hack your system regardless of what fucking proprietary bullshit you have. It's

28:59.480 --> 29:05.720
just going to happen. So I have to have a memory card and is Sony selling a bundle that

29:05.720 --> 29:10.280
includes a memory card? They launched, they're going to have an launch bundles or whatever

29:10.280 --> 29:16.040
that come with like a two gigabyte one I think. Am I correct in hearing that this $250 price

29:16.040 --> 29:21.080
point that everybody was getting very excited about, like, Oh my God, I can't believe they're

29:21.080 --> 29:27.540
releasing the Vita for 250. That is in fact a lie because 250 doesn't get you a memory

29:27.540 --> 29:32.200
card. Am I correct? Doesn't get you a memory card, yeah. But some games do not require

29:32.200 --> 29:37.560
it. Okay. Because some games, remember, they have storage on them for game saves and they

29:37.560 --> 29:42.400
also have storage for download content and stuff like that. Some other games require

29:42.400 --> 29:48.040
memory cards for that storage as well. I was going to say, if these stupid things are required,

29:48.040 --> 29:52.680
then the system's not really $250, is it? But because there is that little, you know,

29:52.680 --> 29:57.560
we call that a new poll where it's like, okay, well really you can play some games without

29:57.560 --> 30:01.560
one. Just like, it's just like the Xbox 360. Remember when they first released? You don't

30:01.560 --> 30:06.840
have to get a hard drive, but you know, if you want to save any games whatsoever. But

30:06.840 --> 30:11.960
they're a little ridiculous. And I mean, I understand the price of memory. I'm sorry,

30:11.960 --> 30:16.960
that's too damn expensive for your damn memory cards. Especially when everything else is

30:16.960 --> 30:21.800
way cheaper. I mean, Microsoft is just as guilty of this with their stupid hard drive

30:21.800 --> 30:29.080
prices. I mean, what, 250 gigabyte hard drive for like $120? I'm sorry, you can get a 250

30:29.080 --> 30:34.520
gigabyte hard drive for probably about 30 bucks, if not cheaper than that. And it's

30:34.520 --> 30:38.560
just such a high markup. And it's not anything really special either. It's just a laptop

30:38.560 --> 30:43.840
hard drive formatted a special way, which you can get any laptop drive and format it

30:43.840 --> 30:47.800
that special way if you have the right software to do that. Now, some of our folks in the

30:47.800 --> 30:51.840
chat room are kind of going back and forth a little bit on this whole thing. And so like

30:51.840 --> 30:56.600
SSJ100 Matt says, so the actual price of the Vita is now about upwards from $350. And Alpha

30:56.600 --> 31:01.920
Kinanagram is like, no, it's 250 plus 25. You don't need 32 gigabytes, although 32 is

31:01.920 --> 31:06.440
nice. Tiger Claw says 32 gigabytes only if you're using it as a primary music and video

31:06.440 --> 31:12.740
player. And that kind of has me thinking, well, what about this whole UMD passport thing?

31:12.740 --> 31:18.940
So if I let me get this right. If I want to play Luminous Old School all over again, assuming

31:18.940 --> 31:24.320
it's even one of the games, I'm just kind of hoping it is. I need to buy the right to

31:24.320 --> 31:29.080
get the passport and I'm going to have to buy a big enough memory card to keep some

31:29.080 --> 31:33.360
of these games on. Yes. Which will end up costing me about as much as probably the game

31:33.360 --> 31:39.560
would just cost me used anyway to just play on my old PSP. Yes. Logic doesn't apply and

31:39.560 --> 31:45.860
when it comes to new video games, Rob, I know it's just, it's, it's so interesting to me

31:45.860 --> 31:51.400
because what got everybody excited about the Vita? What truly got everybody like, fuck

31:51.400 --> 31:56.040
yeah, Sony Vita. What got everybody really excited about it? The price, the back. It

31:56.040 --> 32:01.160
was that price. No, it was not the back touch. It was not the reach around. It was that $250

32:01.160 --> 32:08.320
price and now it's kind of like, oh, but it's, yeah, it's $250 if you want to play, you know,

32:08.320 --> 32:12.880
oh, by the way, uh, and I mentioned this on Twitter earlier this week, but remember how

32:12.880 --> 32:18.000
we were talking last week about Ridge Racer and there's, there's another thing to lose

32:18.000 --> 32:22.320
a little excitement about the Vita over Ridge Racer and how it's supposed to be a little

32:22.320 --> 32:30.320
bit cheaper than your average average PlayStation game. It's $29.99 whereas your average going

32:30.320 --> 32:40.960
costs for a Vita game is going to be $39.99. So you save $10 and you get about 10% of the

32:40.960 --> 32:47.720
game. Fantastic. It's awesome. You know what? I'm going to save myself $30. I'm just not

32:47.720 --> 32:53.920
going to buy that game. You know, I still want a PlayStation Vita just because I am

32:53.920 --> 32:58.840
a consumer whore and I want all the new toys, but I'm finding myself a little less excited

32:58.840 --> 33:02.720
than I was a few months ago. I mean, at the end of the day, it's all about games. It is

33:02.720 --> 33:08.660
all about the game. And if there is a truly like kick ass, oh my God, blow my mind game

33:08.660 --> 33:14.520
on this thing. Like, you know, I got to say luminous on the original PSP was fucking fantastic.

33:14.520 --> 33:19.600
There's a game that good on the PlayStation Vita, then you know, all this stuff seems

33:19.600 --> 33:24.600
a little less worth waiting. Maybe we should learn from our mistakes before that. You know,

33:24.600 --> 33:32.480
being an early adopter doesn't really net you anything. It nets you a bunch of problems

33:32.480 --> 33:38.080
and more expensive price point. That is it. What are you going to net? Oh, I get to play

33:38.080 --> 33:42.280
some of these games early. Well, it's all generation one stuff. I mean, is there really

33:42.280 --> 33:46.640
anything super fantastic? I mean, maybe if you're a big Uncharted fan, then a Uncharted

33:46.640 --> 33:51.320
game might be worth it to you. I sure as hell know I may be somewhat of a Ridge Racer fan,

33:51.320 --> 33:57.000
but I'm not buying Ridge Racer and I don't really care about a new, um, you know, Little

33:57.000 --> 34:01.640
Big Planet game or ports of a bunch of older games, you know, like ultimate, you know,

34:01.640 --> 34:09.840
Marvel versus Capcom three or, um, you know, UFC game, MMA stuff. Uh, I just don't care

34:09.840 --> 34:13.880
that they're porting that stuff over right now. Our chat room is on fire. It is literally

34:13.880 --> 34:18.420
burning with conversation on this whole thing. Uh, Alf Kananagram is talking about the bundle,

34:18.420 --> 34:23.680
the PlayStation Vita first edition bundle, PlayStation Vita 3G plus GPS model case, four

34:23.680 --> 34:29.440
gigabyte card and little deviance $349. God, I sound like a PR dude. I got to admit, not

34:29.440 --> 34:33.400
all that stuff interests me. I'm, I'm probably going to want a card more than four gigabits

34:33.400 --> 34:37.620
and I don't really, I don't need that fucking 3g like I don't need it. I think they have

34:37.620 --> 34:41.360
one that's without the 3g as well, but I'm not sure if that's available over here. I

34:41.360 --> 34:46.840
think that's only in Canada. Go Canada. Tiger class says, what boggles me? Why only up to

34:46.840 --> 34:51.400
32 gigabytes? We got memory sticks that go up to 64 gigabytes. I wish my phone had a

34:51.400 --> 34:56.240
64 gig micro SD card. Then I could put all my music on it and use it as my primary music

34:56.240 --> 35:00.800
player. Here's the problem though. If you're selling a memory stick or a memory card or

35:00.800 --> 35:04.360
whatever you want to call it, that's the same price as the goddamn system. No one's going

35:04.360 --> 35:08.440
to fucking there. Wait a second. I'm just wondering why anyone's surprised. All right,

35:08.440 --> 35:11.640
one more comment. I'm going to get to hear from a private message. Usually I don't read

35:11.640 --> 35:16.140
private messages cause I'm like talk in the main room, but I'll let me Klotov have this

35:16.140 --> 35:20.440
one because he did guest on a whorehouse earlier today. So he did me a favor. But anyway, uh,

35:20.440 --> 35:23.960
even though he only did a mediocre job, no, just kidding. Just kidding. I just want to

35:23.960 --> 35:27.760
give him to all tab and say something angry. Uh, me. Klotov says rumor has it that the

35:27.760 --> 35:34.160
memory sticks also will hold the games, which will be cheaper for download by 40% versus

35:34.160 --> 35:40.440
retail box. Yeah, but here's the thing about that. That's all rumor and I don't know if

35:40.440 --> 35:45.660
that's actually true or not. And on top of that, that all that is is just incentivize

35:45.660 --> 35:52.600
you to buy the more expensive, you know, memory card because at the end of the day, you say

35:52.600 --> 35:57.320
you buy like a four gig stick. What's that going to hold one or two games? I mean, that's

35:57.320 --> 36:03.840
not going to offset the price of that memory card. All I have to say is the more and more

36:03.840 --> 36:09.020
we talk about all this and oh, let, please let that 40% thing be true because once that

36:09.020 --> 36:24.760
news comes out, if that's really not a rumor, you know how the internet's going to react.

36:24.760 --> 36:29.600
The official Sony theme song, ladies and gentlemen. Well, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy

36:29.600 --> 36:33.960
GameStop included. Well, here's the thing is, well, how long is it until the Vita comes

36:33.960 --> 36:39.320
out in Japan? I mean, isn't that like right around the corner? Yeah, it's like the 17th.

36:39.320 --> 36:43.600
I thought the prices, the price points that they had for games on, I don't know if that's

36:43.600 --> 36:49.760
just been announced yet, but I don't think it's going to be 40%. I think it's going to

36:49.760 --> 36:57.520
be either the same price or just slightly under, not 40%. If it is 40% cool, you know,

36:57.520 --> 37:01.480
then that way maybe it gets more people to buy this, you know, their games or whatever

37:01.480 --> 37:08.400
or people just be more selective in what they buy. Alright, let's move on with another story.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.360
This is also about Sony and this, I don't know what to think of this news and I think

37:12.360 --> 37:15.920
a lot of the gaming community doesn't know what to think of this news either. There are

37:15.920 --> 37:23.580
rumors out there that Fumito Udea has quit Sony. Ueda. Ueda, excuse me. He's quit Sony

37:23.580 --> 37:28.560
and why is this important? Oh, he's the creative lead behind a Team Ico, which is creating

37:28.560 --> 37:33.480
The Last Guardian. Remember The Last Guardian? Remember that? That was that game that showed

37:33.480 --> 37:38.360
up at the 2010 E3 that made everybody poop their pants because it looked so really good

37:38.360 --> 37:45.520
and then it was suddenly absent this year. And yeah, apparently he is left. The game

37:45.520 --> 37:49.720
hasn't come out yet and it's like 2012 at this point. Maybe that explains why it was

37:49.720 --> 37:55.440
supposed to be out this holiday and then suddenly it was not. Supposedly he is working on the

37:55.440 --> 38:01.760
project still. He's freelancing. But yeah, interesting. Sony was asked to comment on

38:01.760 --> 38:10.660
the situation and said we do not comment on rumors or speculation. Right. Okay. Be interesting

38:10.660 --> 38:14.320
to see how that impacts that game. I know, right? Especially if they announce it now

38:14.320 --> 38:20.400
for the 360 and the Wii U. It's not. Maybe that's the surprise. It's not going to be

38:20.400 --> 38:28.920
on the 360. It's on the Wii U! What about the Wii U, Loki? What about it? We haven't

38:28.920 --> 38:33.760
seen anything that it actually does. Maybe that's the joke! If I take a big cardboard

38:33.760 --> 38:39.440
box and write Wii U on it and then play a video next to it of all this amazing shit,

38:39.440 --> 38:45.080
are people like, oh my god, I need to buy the Wii U! Look at all the shit it can do!

38:45.080 --> 38:50.440
It doesn't do anything yet! It's just a video with some tech demos and shit. They don't

38:50.440 --> 38:55.000
actually have any hardware that's... I mean, maybe the developers have some hardware that

38:55.000 --> 38:58.720
does something, but at E3 that sure as hell wasn't Wii U hardware. All I'm saying is that

38:58.720 --> 39:02.720
if Nintendo gets up there on the E3 stage and says, from the people that brought you

39:02.720 --> 39:09.360
Shadow of the Colossus and Aiko, comes the last guardian to the Wii U. And I'll just

39:09.360 --> 39:20.720
be like, I don't give a fuck. This is what you're going to hear in the audience. It's

39:20.720 --> 39:25.520
not going to go to any other platform other than Sony. I guarantee it. It's not going

39:25.520 --> 39:29.320
to happen. He'll probably work on something... It's fun to fantasize about, dammit. It's

39:29.320 --> 39:36.600
not fun to fantasize about. Who cares? I mean, yeah, people will be excited that it's coming

39:36.600 --> 39:42.480
to another platform. He'll probably do something amazing later on. It'll be separate from all

39:42.480 --> 39:49.440
this. Form his own game studio, and so on. Alright, let me reset Yackety Sax for the

39:49.440 --> 39:56.320
next story, Dark Sakura. Xenoblade. Which, you know, they said, oh, no plans, no plans,

39:56.320 --> 40:06.560
blah blah, it's getting released in the US. As a GameStop exclusive. Retail exclusive.

40:06.560 --> 40:18.240
It's not just a GameStop. I know, but... Um, they said, Nintendo of America has said that

40:18.240 --> 40:27.400
it's going to be out in April 2012. But I mean, why, why, why not have just already

40:27.400 --> 40:36.200
put it out? It's in English. It's there. Why wait? Because, Dark Sakura, they have to

40:36.200 --> 40:47.720
remove the Us and put the Zs back in. So what? So what? Okay, so... Excuse me, the Zeds.

40:47.720 --> 40:54.280
And all the Zeds are now Zs. So Maneuver has a few extra vowels in it that make it look

40:54.280 --> 41:01.960
nonsensical. Americans won't understand it. So Yogurt has an H in it. Is there yogurt

41:01.960 --> 41:05.760
in the Xenoblade Chronicles? I don't know, but... Fuck, you can do a lot in that game.

41:05.760 --> 41:15.480
There probably is yogurt. Just, you know what? Just for that, I'm still going to get the

41:15.480 --> 41:22.640
British one. Look, I really am trying to put my thoughts together on this. No, I haven't

41:22.640 --> 41:27.640
pre-ordered it. I haven't until April. Why, why pre-order it today? I am, I don't need

41:27.640 --> 41:31.340
to pre-order this. Rob's got a little steam-plot over his head. I just, I do because I really

41:31.340 --> 41:37.240
feel like, I feel like we are... Have you ever heard that term, I'm being set up to

41:37.240 --> 41:42.880
fail? Yes. Have you ever heard that before? You're setting me up to fail. At work all

41:42.880 --> 41:47.320
the time. I really, yeah, it's a very common workplace saying. It's a very, very thing

41:47.320 --> 41:50.480
you hear there is that we don't want to set people up to fail. Yes, they do. We're not

41:50.480 --> 41:56.920
a company that sets people up to fail. Yes, they do. Okay. I feel like this game is being

41:56.920 --> 42:08.980
set up to fail. Yeah. And it's a pity because the game itself is fantastic. I mean, for

42:08.980 --> 42:16.240
a Wii game. It's, at the end of the day, a game is a game. And even though it's a really,

42:16.240 --> 42:22.000
really, really good PlayStation 2 role-playing game, it's still a really good RPG that any

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
RPG fan needs to experience. For real. I mean, for real. I mean, so what if it doesn't have

42:26.000 --> 42:29.800
the cutting-edge graphics and all that stuff? We pimp classic games here on the show all

42:29.800 --> 42:33.880
the time. It is something that people should experience if you like role-playing games

42:33.880 --> 42:38.320
in the slightest because this game does a lot. And like seriously, when you do play

42:38.320 --> 42:43.460
it, you're like, this is a Wii game? Because they don't do stuff like this on the Wii.

42:43.460 --> 42:51.120
And they should! But the problem is, I think we're, like, A, this game is coming out now.

42:51.120 --> 42:56.640
It's like, the joke's over. And everybody's left the building. Like, like, a Loki said

42:56.640 --> 43:00.760
earlier, he didn't want to make his Xbox lube joke because it was a week old. Well, this

43:00.760 --> 43:05.260
game is coming out, like, years after it came out in Japan at this point, right? It's gotta

43:05.260 --> 43:11.040
be at least a year since it's out in Japan. At least six months from Europe, for sure.

43:11.040 --> 43:14.240
And for what reason, we don't know. After everyone who already really wanted it has

43:14.240 --> 43:19.200
pirated it at it. Pirated it at it. Let me put it this way. If you're translating from

43:19.200 --> 43:25.440
English to English, English English to English, I think it would take one person maybe a week

43:25.440 --> 43:33.280
to finish that. I mean... It's called, um, Find and Replace. Yeah. I mean, I don't see

43:33.280 --> 43:37.800
how that would be that difficult to go through there. And oh, oh shit, I missed one of the

43:37.800 --> 43:43.120
words that's spelled in English English. Who cares? People are gonna be able to read it.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.580
And you know what? Maybe the common consumer probably wouldn't even notice that that was

43:46.580 --> 43:50.780
misspelled in the first place. Or it's spelled correctly but just not in the way that we

43:50.780 --> 43:56.400
may spell it correctly. Who gives a shit? You can understand it. So, so for one, it's

43:56.400 --> 44:01.920
coming out long after everybody who was passionate about this game has already played it. So

44:01.920 --> 44:05.720
now it's just kind of on a limb, like, who's gonna be honest about it and actually buy

44:05.720 --> 44:09.640
the game if they pirated it. Or, you know, you have to somehow convince the people that

44:09.640 --> 44:13.640
imported it that it's worth buying twice when they're not enhancing it whatsoever. At least

44:13.640 --> 44:18.720
they haven't said. I, I can't believe I came on this show and said, Nintendo's, they're

44:18.720 --> 44:22.120
not gonna wait this long and then just re-release the same game. You'll get like Xenoblade Chronicles

44:22.120 --> 44:27.360
Master Edition or International Edition. I'll have some extra stuff. Oops. Boy, did I give

44:27.360 --> 44:31.760
somebody too much credit. Come on, Rob. I mean, this, this is a company that innovates

44:31.760 --> 44:36.000
in every turn possible. I mean, they wouldn't, this isn't a company that would, I don't know,

44:36.000 --> 44:40.480
take a Super NES ROM and put it on a CD and call it an anniversary edition or something

44:40.480 --> 44:44.960
like that and sell it for $30 instead of putting it on the Virtual Console. No, they would

44:44.960 --> 44:48.880
never do that. Ever. I mean, this isn't a company that tries to cash in. I really wanna

44:48.880 --> 44:53.440
look at this translation. You know, you know what I mean. I bet it comes out and all that

44:53.440 --> 44:58.880
shit is still in there. I bet they didn't touch the goddamn game at all. Yeah. So, what

44:58.880 --> 45:03.720
do you wanna bet? We'll see, we'll see. But anyway, and now it's this whole limited release

45:03.720 --> 45:07.800
thing. What does this tell you? If you can only get it through GameStop and you can only

45:07.800 --> 45:13.080
get it on Nintendo.com, that means that they're not really gonna do a lot of marketing behind

45:13.080 --> 45:16.820
this. You're not gonna see Xenoblade TV commercials. You're not gonna see magazine ads really a

45:16.820 --> 45:20.960
whole lot. Maybe onesie twosie here and there. GameStop might promote it a little bit. GameInformer

45:20.960 --> 45:23.480
will probably have an ad for it. Oh, that's true. GameInformer will probably have it.

45:23.480 --> 45:28.440
And they are a big magazine. But it's not gonna be quite that campaign you would see

45:28.440 --> 45:33.160
behind old, say, Mario Kart 3DS or, you know, some of the other stuff Nintendo's got going

45:33.160 --> 45:38.840
on right now. Which, it just seems like they're just gonna, ugh, hear. Well, it's all about,

45:38.840 --> 45:46.960
you know, exposing themselves to loss. And they stay, I mean, history has shown with

45:46.960 --> 45:51.400
games on the Wii, if you put out something that even be considered slightly niche, it's

45:51.400 --> 45:55.120
not gonna sell very well. I mean, look at Mad World, look at, you know, even some of

45:55.120 --> 46:00.480
the more hardcore games like Conduit, Conduit 2, and that kind of stuff. It just, it, it

46:00.480 --> 46:04.600
looks good. It could be really cutting edge as far as, you know, the technology behind

46:04.600 --> 46:08.840
it or something like that. Or it can be really edgy, it's like a violent game and stuff.

46:08.840 --> 46:13.800
But people, and hype it up all you want, but it doesn't sell. And unfortunately, you know,

46:13.800 --> 46:20.640
for Nintendo to publish this, and, you know, to bring it over here, I mean that, it's a

46:20.640 --> 46:25.140
risky thing for them to do when they can spend that same amount of marketing, or, well, they're

46:25.140 --> 46:29.400
not doing any marketing, but spend some money on, you know, another Mario Kart game or another

46:29.400 --> 46:34.680
Mario game that they know they're gonna sell millions of copies of. But, at the same time,

46:34.680 --> 46:40.840
you know, cause they kinda, they wanna not lose all their cred with, you know, hardcore

46:40.840 --> 46:45.560
gamers because their next system is kind of aimed at the hardcore gamer. I mean, at least

46:45.560 --> 46:49.560
that's what they're trying to, you know, this is how they're skewing it right now with saying,

46:49.560 --> 46:53.840
look, Ninja Gaiden, or Ninja Gaiden's gonna be on. Look, hey, there's a Ghost Recon game

46:53.840 --> 46:57.600
that's gonna be on. Hey, look, it's gonna have, you know, all these publishers backing

46:57.600 --> 47:01.120
it and putting their games on the Wii U. We want, you know, the hardcore gamers to come

47:01.120 --> 47:07.240
back. But, I think this game would have been better off having, like, an Atlus or an Ignition

47:07.240 --> 47:11.860
or Exceed or something like that bring, this is a perfect game for something like Exceed

47:11.860 --> 47:15.960
to bring over because this is the type of games they bring up. They bring over niche

47:15.960 --> 47:16.960
RPGs.

47:16.960 --> 47:21.680
Yeah, problem. Problem. It was developed by a Nintendo second party. So, can't happen.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.440
All this makes me miss working designs.

47:23.440 --> 47:27.120
Sure it can. It can, it can definitely happen. If they don't wanna publish it over here,

47:27.120 --> 47:29.360
they can sell the rights to somebody else to publish it.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.360
True.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.360
But, here's what I think happened, and the reason why it's a GameStop exclusive, because

47:33.360 --> 47:35.560
they backed money to bring it over here.

47:35.560 --> 47:39.400
Yeah, that's what our chat's saying too. GameGuru in our chatroom says, GameStop probably paid

47:39.400 --> 47:45.360
for the publishing in the US so long as they got to sell it exclusive. I just, I don't

47:45.360 --> 47:50.600
know. I just, I worry at the end of the day it's not gonna sell as much as it should,

47:50.600 --> 47:54.720
and then Nintendo's gonna say, well, this is why you can't have nice things. We were

47:54.720 --> 48:00.880
gracious and kind enough to give in to Operation Rainfall, and it didn't sell, so no last story

48:00.880 --> 48:02.160
for you. Goodbye.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.080
Here's why I say that. Fuck em. Because, you know what? I don't need them to bring out

48:05.080 --> 48:08.720
fucking RPGs. They can pump out all the goddamn Mario games they want. Because, guess what?

48:08.720 --> 48:13.720
This world has multiple publishers. It's just full of publishers that bring out RPGs, like

48:13.720 --> 48:19.520
Atlas, or Exceed, or, you know, hell, Square Enix puts out RPGs. And guess what? I don't

48:19.520 --> 48:24.680
need you to fucking bring over anything. You can fucking pump out your goddamn sports game

48:24.680 --> 48:29.280
games, your stupid, if there's another goddamn game with WooHoo Island in it, I don't give

48:29.280 --> 48:33.800
a fuck if WooHoo Island is in there. It's not a landmark, it's not something like, oh

48:33.800 --> 48:38.080
my god, this island's in here, it's such a character, as they put it. I don't fucking

48:38.080 --> 48:42.480
care. Hey, why don't you put WooHoo Island in fucking, you know, Xenoblade or whatever,

48:42.480 --> 48:46.800
because I'm sure fans of Nintendo games are gonna want to see that. And hell, Mario's

48:46.800 --> 48:50.240
a playable character, since, you know, it's a Nintendo published game, it's gotta have

48:50.240 --> 48:51.720
fucking Mario in it.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.720
Mamma mia.

48:52.720 --> 48:57.560
So, I don't give a shit if they, you know, don't bring it out of here. And if they're

48:57.560 --> 49:02.640
like, we listen to the fans, and the fans didn't follow through, well, fuck you, you

49:02.640 --> 49:06.520
know what, because when the Wii U comes out, and you're just putting out Zelda and shit,

49:06.520 --> 49:10.480
and sure, people are gonna cream themselves over goddamn Zelda, and to be fair-

49:10.480 --> 49:16.960
Well, I was gonna say, hold on, hold on, because as angry as you're getting right now, Skyward

49:16.960 --> 49:21.280
Sword? Really fucking good, from what I'm hearing, I haven't played it myself. But that

49:21.280 --> 49:26.920
Mario 3DS game, I will tell you first hand, is that good.

49:26.920 --> 49:32.880
Okay? To be fair, though, like I said, Zelda is not a fucking Final Fantasy. It's not a

49:32.880 --> 49:36.840
Xenoblade. It's a different type of game. It's an adventure game, if you will. It's

49:36.840 --> 49:42.080
not an RPG. It's an adventure game. It's a different type of game altogether. See, this

49:42.080 --> 49:48.280
is- if that was the case, if, you know, hey, we're looking for some adventure games to

49:48.280 --> 49:51.640
satisfy our fans, then boom, there you go. You have your game right there. You have your

49:51.640 --> 49:53.080
good Mario games.

49:53.080 --> 49:58.240
But Nintendo does this stuff where they have brilliant ideas, and they implement them really

49:58.240 --> 50:03.240
well once, and then they just forget that they ever did it again. Perfect example. Excite

50:03.240 --> 50:07.560
Truck for the Wii when it first came out. Utilize the SC memory card slot, because everyone's

50:07.560 --> 50:12.580
like, holy shit, you know, we can play our own music on there. And then they never did

50:12.580 --> 50:17.240
it again. Oh, oh, I am sorry, they did it once in Endless Ocean, but who gives a fuck?

50:17.240 --> 50:22.560
No one bought Endless Ocean. It's a goddamn, you know, swimming game. If I want to go snorkeling,

50:22.560 --> 50:27.120
I will go outside and go snorkeling. I don't need to play a game to simulate that. But

50:27.120 --> 50:32.600
that was, like, the two times that they ever used that stupid SC memory card slot for anything

50:32.600 --> 50:33.960
other than, later on, game sets.

50:33.960 --> 50:36.700
This is where your anger really stems from, isn't it?

50:36.700 --> 50:41.160
It's because they do stupid shit, because now everyone's like, oh, look, look, Project

50:41.160 --> 50:46.680
Grainfall worked! No, no, they did it so they could save face, so they're like, see? We

50:46.680 --> 50:51.200
care about the hardcore gamer. Buy the Wii U. We're gonna put out hardcore games for

50:51.200 --> 50:54.920
it. Then you buy the Wii U, and you're gonna get fucking Mario games, and more fucking

50:54.920 --> 50:59.040
Mario games, and more fucking Mario games, and more Mario games. Oh, and there's gonna

50:59.040 --> 51:02.880
be a Zelda there, because, you know, that's a hardcore game now, and maybe a Metroid that's

51:02.880 --> 51:03.880
gonna suck.

51:03.880 --> 51:09.440
Can I go? I gotta go to the chat with this comment, because it's interesting. And rdgsinge

51:09.440 --> 51:16.420
in our chatroom says, the new Zelda sure got pushed aside by Skyrim this year. I'm not

51:16.420 --> 51:19.760
sure how to take that comment, because there's a lot of ways you gotta read into it, and

51:19.760 --> 51:24.280
it's kind of like, well, why can't you have two great games? And I think you can, but

51:24.280 --> 51:28.640
certainly at the end of the day, what are people really talking about? And I gotta say,

51:28.640 --> 51:33.600
I do hear probably as many people, if not more, talking about Skyrim than I am hearing

51:33.600 --> 51:37.320
about Zelda. Just kind of like on the average, on my Facebook feed, in real life, people

51:37.320 --> 51:42.600
I know that wouldn't go to the extent to read gaming news or download gaming podcasts but

51:42.600 --> 51:47.820
still spend money on video games are playing a lot of Skyrim. But I am hearing some Zelda

51:47.820 --> 51:53.840
2, but it seems like five years ago, when it was Twilight Princess, that was all anybody

51:53.840 --> 51:56.120
could talk about. Nobody shared the stage.

51:56.120 --> 51:59.480
That's the thing, though, is it's been a long time since there have been some really good

51:59.480 --> 52:03.060
games. And yeah, there have been some Mario games that have been pretty good and whatever,

52:03.060 --> 52:08.000
and some other good Wii games. But a lot of people have kind of put their Wii away or

52:08.000 --> 52:11.580
sold their Wii, because they're like, fuck, there's nothing coming out that I want to

52:11.580 --> 52:12.580
play anymore.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.580
That's my Wii.

52:13.580 --> 52:19.200
You know, so it's like, well, who cares? And also, Skyward Sword, one system. Skyrim on

52:19.200 --> 52:23.680
a bunch of systems and PCs. So, I mean, I can understand why more people are talking

52:23.680 --> 52:27.320
about it. But once again, RPG adventure game. Different. Completely different.

52:27.320 --> 52:29.440
Not for Grandma, who still has the Wii.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.480
It's definitely not for Grandma. I mean, it's just, it's not a game that's going to appeal

52:33.480 --> 52:38.040
to a lot of people. And to be honest, if you think about it, Skyward Sword is almost kind

52:38.040 --> 52:43.780
of a risky move for them. I mean, if you think about it, their big thing was, let's get non-gamers

52:43.780 --> 52:49.000
into buying our system and we're going to sell games to them.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.220
Yeah, but there's a problem. They were non-gamers for a reason. They don't play games. And yeah,

52:54.220 --> 53:00.080
they may play Wii Sports or whatever when family's over, but your Wii party didn't sell

53:00.080 --> 53:05.640
very well, because no one buys games that are non-gamers.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.640
Xenoblade may have sold well for some of the stuff, because once again, you're convincing

53:08.640 --> 53:11.960
them it's a party game. But Skyward Sword, not a party game. Not really anything that

53:11.960 --> 53:17.000
non-gamers are going to be interested in. It is kind of, you know, hey, fans of the

53:17.000 --> 53:21.240
series and hardcore gamers or whatever on the Wii platform, hey, we're still considering

53:21.240 --> 53:27.720
you. And it's great that they can put together some good quality games on the platform.

53:27.720 --> 53:34.560
But at the same time, I just, when I saw that they're bringing a Xenoblade over or whatever,

53:34.560 --> 53:38.240
I was just like, eh, I don't fucking care. I'm not going to buy it. I mean, especially

53:38.240 --> 53:41.320
when they said GameStop, I'm like, really not going to buy it.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.640
I gotta be honest. Well, I'm not buying it from GameStop, but you can pre-order it on

53:44.640 --> 53:48.480
Nintendo.com and maybe a little closer to April. I am leaning towards, I think I might

53:48.480 --> 53:56.200
buy it. It's a good game at the end of the day, despite my displeasure of how they're

53:56.200 --> 54:01.000
fucking this up. I think it's still a fantastic game and it's kind of like in the same vein

54:01.000 --> 54:06.200
the Dark Sakura would spend like $200 on a Castlevania or Neo Geo thing or whatever stuff

54:06.200 --> 54:09.800
she finds and puts in the vault that they spend a lot of money on. It's just kind of

54:09.800 --> 54:13.000
one of those things where it's like, I'd like to buy it, keep it in the shrink wrap as a

54:13.000 --> 54:15.160
piece of gaming history. Well, we have almost everything that Working

54:15.160 --> 54:18.640
Designs put out. Same thing. It's kind of one of those things.

54:18.640 --> 54:22.220
Let me word it in a different way then. I'm not fucking begging any goddamn publishers

54:22.220 --> 54:28.080
for a fucking game. So you know what? You're here, publishers, to please me as a consumer.

54:28.080 --> 54:32.880
And if you want me to fucking beg and plead to give you money, then you can go fuck yourself

54:32.880 --> 54:37.360
because I'm not doing that. And hey, Nintendo, with your Wii U, if it sucks balls, I'm not

54:37.360 --> 54:41.560
fucking buying it. Or in your goddamn Mario games that come out of there. And yeah, I'll

54:41.560 --> 54:46.260
give a shit about Mario Kart Wii U. It'll use probably the touch pad for some other

54:46.260 --> 54:51.000
goddamn awful thing that you can use the button for. Whatever. I don't care. Yeah, I may get

54:51.000 --> 54:55.160
in on 3DS. But I'm still considering that because I don't really consider a game that

54:55.160 --> 55:00.420
has all these classic tracks. What if the Mario game is really good? Like

55:00.420 --> 55:04.640
Mario 3DS Land. Or whatever the hell it's called. Super Mario 3D Land.

55:04.640 --> 55:09.480
One game on a console does not warrant me buying that console. If it's good. It has

55:09.480 --> 55:12.980
to be the majority of the games on the console being good. And I'm sorry if there's other

55:12.980 --> 55:17.120
things on other consoles, especially cross console stuff, I'm gonna get it on a console

55:17.120 --> 55:21.280
that, you know, I don't have to pay extra money for to get some... I mean, like, come

55:21.280 --> 55:26.080
on. Zelda sold me a Super Nintendo. And a lot of games have sold me the systems. You

55:26.080 --> 55:31.660
know, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation. It's true, Final Fantasy 7 sold me a Playstation.

55:31.660 --> 55:35.480
There was a lot of games on the Wii that sold me a Wii. But you know what? I bought the

55:35.480 --> 55:42.880
Wii and I played some of those games and... haven't really touched it since. Played a

55:42.880 --> 55:50.040
little bit of Animal Crossing a few months back, but... I mean, I kinda was like, eh.

55:50.040 --> 55:53.080
It's kind of a waste of my money. And I don't wanna make that mistake again.

55:53.080 --> 55:56.320
Alright, in the interest of time, let's move on, but I'm sure we'll get lots of emails

55:56.320 --> 55:59.840
on it this week. Oh wait, you can't email us. Actually, no. The email should be fixed

55:59.840 --> 56:05.840
mid-week. So after about Tuesday, Wednesday, email us again. Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

56:05.840 --> 56:09.720
Meanwhile, we got more news to cover, so I'm gonna go back to Loki.

56:09.720 --> 56:16.760
Alright. So let's see here. Let's talk a little bit about... this is kinda cool. And I actually

56:16.760 --> 56:22.960
had one of my co-workers tell me about this company prior to this news, so I just kind

56:22.960 --> 56:29.120
of reinviged it. There's a company called ClickNation, and I guess they were behind

56:29.120 --> 56:37.600
some free-to-play games like Six-Gun Galaxy, Age of Champions, or Starship Command, which

56:37.600 --> 56:40.080
I'm not too familiar with those games, but...

56:40.080 --> 56:42.880
Cause they're Facebook games and there's a lot of those.

56:42.880 --> 56:47.680
Yes, and it was funny, cause it was one of my co-workers, who's a friend of one of the

56:47.680 --> 56:54.000
guys at the company, which I gotta talk to that co-worker later on this week. He's like

56:54.000 --> 57:00.040
saying, hey, have you heard these guys? I saw them. They're just down the street from

57:00.040 --> 57:06.520
my house. I wonder if you've heard of any of these games or whatever. And I was like,

57:06.520 --> 57:13.480
I haven't heard anything. But yeah, apparently ClickNation, they will be joining with Bioware

57:13.480 --> 57:21.840
and EA. I guess they're saying it's an opportunity to realize our vision for bringing high-quality

57:21.840 --> 57:30.280
RPG titles to a fast-growing, highly-engaged, core gamer crowd. And they're also planning

57:30.280 --> 57:36.200
on bringing stuff to social platforms like Facebook and stuff. So maybe seeing Bioware

57:36.200 --> 57:40.840
games on Facebook. Well, you already have the Dragon Age game that's out there on, well

57:40.840 --> 57:44.760
I haven't seen it on Google+, but I imagine it's on Facebook too. Yeah, so more like that

57:44.760 --> 57:51.200
type of game on, you know, cause that's kind of what they're working on, that kind of stuff.

57:51.200 --> 57:55.040
And so it's Bioware Sacramento now, that's kind of cool. Yeah, cause that's where we,

57:55.040 --> 57:58.560
if you didn't know, that's where Orange Launch Radio is headquartered, is in Sacramento.

57:58.560 --> 58:01.560
I did a little investigative journalism, if you will. I just wanted to figure out where

58:01.560 --> 58:04.760
these guys were located. I wanted to know if they were downtown or if they were in the

58:04.760 --> 58:09.360
suburb. Well, do you know where they are downtown? I found this fascinating. I actually, because

58:09.360 --> 58:14.000
their address is on the website and I was like, I wonder if I know where it is. So I

58:14.000 --> 58:23.920
Googled it and put it in the maps. Guess what they are next door to? The Depot. Oh, fun.

58:23.920 --> 58:30.160
Do you know what the Depot is, our international audience? It's the Gay Bar downtown. The Gay

58:30.160 --> 58:35.480
Bar. No, there's well that it's, it's right at the corner of the kind of where all the

58:35.480 --> 58:41.280
gay bars are down there. So, uh, I think it's hilarious. Bioware Sacramento, Bioware is

58:41.280 --> 58:46.760
now officially next door to a gay bar, which, you know, it's just whatever, but it's, it's

58:46.760 --> 58:50.060
just kind of funny because, you know, especially Bioware has also been kind of one of the leading

58:50.060 --> 58:56.200
companies in kind of breaking down that barrier and a lot of their storytelling too, you know,

58:56.200 --> 59:00.960
obviously with Dragon Age and all that stuff. Um, Alan's tried and they've got positions

59:00.960 --> 59:04.740
on the website and I think a lot of it's like design stuff too. So you really should. Yeah,

59:04.740 --> 59:10.080
you should look into that. So in fact, we should, gosh, now there's like gaming companies

59:10.080 --> 59:15.520
starting to pop up here. There's, there's us, there's Bioware Sacramento, there's the

59:15.520 --> 59:19.560
Prima Games. People are actually here too. The strategy guys that come out of there.

59:19.560 --> 59:27.640
We need to like have a, have a luncheon. I have a short luncheon. Hi two people. We need

59:27.640 --> 59:31.800
to rent out the back room at the spaghetti factory, which is across the street from Bioware

59:31.800 --> 59:38.440
Sacramento. Sacramento's not on the website yet. No, but they go to their old name, the

59:38.440 --> 59:42.480
click nation or whatever it's on there. But a lot of that's probably changed. Oh yeah,

59:42.480 --> 59:49.280
I applied with them before as click nation. Yeah. So there you go. A little more gaming

59:49.280 --> 59:53.000
movie and moving into our backyard. That's pretty cool. Anyone all said and done? Yeah.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.320
So good luck to them. I mean, I, I gotta admit, I'm not huge on the Facebook games, but you

59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.240
know, especially with, here's where I could see kind of this going. You know, a lot of

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.440
people very excited about the old Republic, which Bioware is a part of. If they can find

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.080
the way to the magic sweet spot to really interface that with Facebook, I think there'll

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.860
be a step ahead of Warcraft because World of Warcraft, you know, yeah, they've kind

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:20.440
of tried Facebook apps, but they're not that great. They just kind of published like, Hey,

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.520
my character got this achievement and Hey, look at this 3d model of my character. And

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.640
it always seems to break whenever there's new patch. So, you know, Blizzard has not

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.820
been interfacing with Facebook very well. So this is a chance where Bioware could maybe

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:38.920
get a step up. So who knows that these will be the guys to do it or not. So pretty cool.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.440
Fun stuff going on in the backyard. All right. Um, moving on. Lots of reports coming out

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.200
of black Friday sales. Of course, black Friday is what we call the day after Thanksgiving

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.800
here in the U S because there are a lot of crazy sales that happen around that day. And

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.680
now some of the sales numbers are in apparently and Loki will love this. Uh, following up

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.960
with the rants, he was just saying there, Nintendo of America in an interview with USA

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.400
today mentioned that super Mario 3d land has become the fastest selling portable Mario

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.320
game ever. Wait a minute. How many portable Mario games have there been? There was Mario

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.600
land on the game boy. There was, yeah, but those are all rehashes. They never really

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.240
did a proper Mario game on the advance specifically made for the advance. Did they, they don't

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.960
think they're going to count that anyway. Yeah. Mario Kart. Yeah. So I don't know. Anyway,

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.960
so whatever it is, the fastest selling game ever. It moved half a million copies since

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:42.520
November 13th. 3ds system sales are, are up way up to system sales up 325% for the week

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:48.740
of November 20th. Yeah, that helps when no one was buying your system to begin with.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:54.880
The we had its biggest black Friday ever. Half a million systems sold on black Friday

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:01.080
alone. They needed that cause they were not selling well at all. The legend is Zelda skyward

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:09.860
sword 535,000 copies. Fastest selling Zelda in history. There you go. Lots of stuff coming

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.760
out of Nintendo, Microsoft having a lot of good stuff too. They moved almost a million

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.760
Xbox three sixties on the week of black Friday. They don't say specifically back Friday, but

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:29.000
like just under a million three sixties, 750,000 connects that same week. I I'm kind of surprised

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.520
that the connect had such a huge year. There really doesn't seem to be a lot going on the

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.280
connect right now except maybe like Dan central twos. There's a lot of games out for the connect

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:41.920
though. A lot of games out. A lot of, not a lot of good games, but a lot of games are

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.480
out, but there's some good stuff. I had to giggle the other day when I was on the Xbox

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:51.200
website because they're like connect for core like as in hardcore gamers and they have like

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.840
a picture of four zone there. I'm like because it is head tracking has some voice commands

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.240
that's hardly connect game and just dance three, which is a connect game, but this is

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.120
a franchise that was really popular on the we between November 20th and 26 just dance

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:17.560
three sold 700,000 copies. Lots Abba. You can dance. No, uh, no, uh, sales figures on that

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:23.680
just right now, but I'm telling you, I didn't talk about that game the other week. Oh, it's

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.760
fabulous. Oh, Rob, dark soccer. Watched me play Abba. You can dance on the way and I

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.280
got to say the gayest thing I've ever seen. There was a song. It's really something. There

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.400
was a song. You got it. You got to see it. You got to have a ballerina. Yeah. And Rob

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.200
was trying to go in point. You literally do ballerina dances to one of the songs and he

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.040
has like a little ballerina on the screen. So you have to kind of do a little ballerina

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.360
dance. Hilarious. Um, I think it was the winner takes it all or something. It was Fernando.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.140
Maybe I don't know. Whatever. Yeah, no, it was the winner takes it all. I think cause

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:07.320
it's a slow song. You know, I had to do the hand sweepy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Anyhow. Oh

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.840
God. That was, I have, why isn't Abba you can dance on connect? Anyway, blurry photos

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.640
of Rob that better not end up on the internet. I will destroy you. I'm going to call you

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.000
dance. Squatch. All right. You know, cause every picture of the Sasquatch is blurry.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.400
Shush. All right. Uh, let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel around

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.240
the world and check out games coming out soon. Although it's probably dried up quite a bit

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:36.280
moving past black Friday now. Uh, yeah, it's usually, uh, December is quite a dead month.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.280
In fact, this is probably the biggest week of December and the rest of the weeks are

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.400
probably going to be just a couple titles. But this week we had a Mario Kart seven. Well

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.720
today that's on the three DS fortune street coming out on the Wii this week. Uh, Jaws

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.600
ultimate predator on the Wii and three DS face racers photo finish on the three DS nano

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:04.440
assault on the three DS. Uh, Ubisoft is releasing their own tablet thing to compete with you.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:13.760
Draw the draw some tablet that's coming out. Yeah, it's, it's awesome. Um, outdoors unleashed

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:21.600
Africa and Alaska coming out on three DS, uh, just dance three on the PlayStation three

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.760
finally coming out for the PlayStation move. The adventures of Tintin the game on Xbox

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:32.880
three 60 PlayStation three we and the three DS. No one Kirk her. I care about 10, 10 bar.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.980
Just know the game will be garbage. It's the game doesn't look like garbage. It's actually

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.160
kind of a neat little adventure game. Just not talking about what a, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.120
wait, wait. Interruption. Amiga seven seven seven says it's been reported that for me

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:56.760
to confirm to connect, we make a blue stinger formula one 2011 for the three DS, the Oregon

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:05.240
trail for the Wii and three DS this week. Hell yeah. And, uh, I think my we died of

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:11.640
dysentery actually. I believe that is it. All right, then let's move on to Japan and

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.000
talk about the Japanese release dates and things you have to look forward to over there

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.200
this week on December the eighth on the Xbox three 60 Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast connect

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.320
Disneyland adventures. Michael Jackson, the experience, boy, that game has been out here

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.620
a while, but you're finally getting in Japan this week in regular and limited editions

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:36.120
and the elder scrolls. Skyrim comes out in Japan this week. I can't imagine they've localized

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.840
everything, but maybe they've taken care of some of the, uh, you know, menus and things.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.840
I don't know, but that's, um, interesting. They are bringing that out in Japan. Um, by

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.760
the way, next week, huge release final fantasy 13 to this is Japan again. I know we're getting

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.960
it early next year. PlayStation three on December the eighth beyond the future fix the time

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.060
arrow in regular limited edition Dragon Ball Z ultimate blast. Michael Jackson, the experience

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.560
need for speed, the run Japan's edition as well as the elder scrolls Skyrim there as

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.280
well. I actually did all the voice acting stuff in Japanese. Did they really? Yeah,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.280
they have a lot. They have a trailer that shows it there. It was one, I think it was

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.840
on Kotaku. They were saying, which trailer is most or which language trailer is the most

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:28.680
epic? And they had a Japanese and German and French and whole bunch of stuff. Um, I'm just

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.040
trying, I'm searching the YouTube's right now. Let's see the elder scrolls five Skyrim

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.480
Japan trailer. I better not get trolled with this YouTube link. Let's see. We are live

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:57.080
folks. Let's see. I'm feeling moved already. I don't know about you guys. There's not a

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:17.840
lot of talking.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:34.160
God, this game is really good. I actually do have to say that that's an example of the

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.960
Japanese voice acting. It sounds really good. They could be reading this in pig Latin and

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:42.800
I would still be like, this game is so fucking epic. Anyway, I'm not going to play the entire

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.640
thing, but there you go. Wow. I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do it that fast.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.120
So props to them. That's really something else. All right. Also on the PlayStation three

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.600
this week, wizardry perfect pack comes out this week. That's a role playing game. I wonder

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.560
if that ties into the old ass wizardry series for back in the day. It probably does. Um,

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:07.280
let's see on other systems, the PlayStation Vita not out just yet. That is December 17th,

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.820
but otherwise anything on the Wii this week, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:15.320
games and Michael Jackson, the experience and need for speed. The run, all the versions

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.720
on the Wii are out this week as well. Let me check the 3ds lastly real quick. Ah, world

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.120
soccer winning 11 2012 soccer games are usually pretty big over there and looks like on a

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.640
special release day, the 10th of December, this might be slightly a big G big deal. Monster

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.380
Hunter 3g. That's right. The Monster Hunter 3ds game is out. People are going to be piled

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:40.720
outside waiting for it. That's slightly a big deal who will be in line. Yeah. Freaking

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.320
Monster Hunter. All right. Two games in the UK. All right. What on the ninth dizzy Prince

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:52.760
of yolk folk on the iPhone and Android and just dance three for PlayStation three. There

01:09:52.760 --> 01:10:00.700
you go. All right. Dark soccer. More gaming news please. Well, um, I don't know if Alan

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.680
knows about this. He does. I trolled him with it already. Well, a valve employee was spotted

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:15.480
wearing a half-life three shirt and the person that took the picture, um, John Donna, I think

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.560
is how it's pronounced. Um, took, asked permission to take the picture too and put it on his

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:28.520
Twitter. So, um, it's a big half-life logo with the three. Yeah. I want to create an

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:36.240
actual shirt that has half-life four on it. Just saying that, you know, um, here's the

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.840
thing is that a lot of people are going like, OMG and rightfully so like this game needs

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.160
to just fucking happen already. But at the same time, valve is totally not above trolling

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.460
people and like this whole thing could be kind of fake and trolling. But, um, I hope

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:53.880
it's true. I know it would make the person I live with extremely happy if it is true.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:00.800
Um, but, uh, the problem is it could also be a joke. So I mean, is this something that

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.440
valve would have to wait all the way to E3 to announce or they probably would want to

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.620
show off the new engine obviously because it would, it would be a new engine. So I imagine

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.000
I guess if it's real, maybe, maybe something early next year. Cause you know, what else

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.520
is valve working on right now that we know of the dota game? That's about whatever. Yeah.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.600
I'm going to put a picture up on our tumbler. All right. And a salacious pop or Alan is

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.800
in our chat right now saying shaking and crying, shaking and crying. I'm there with, I hope

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:34.480
it's true. I, I, a lot of people, if it's true, then I'll need new underwear. All right.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:41.840
Valve tried to give us all a little bit of warning. All right. Uh, Loki. All right. Um,

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:50.260
so let's see here. This is a kind of a annoying, I guess. You remember how some of these publishers

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.680
are doing online passes? Well, EA being the first out of the gate with the whole online

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.300
passing as part of their project. $10. Well, there's a little something, something that

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:06.800
they forgot to mention to you that's in the end user license agreements. You may not have

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.920
seen those online passes can expire. That's right. Um, apparently there is a guy that

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:20.280
was, um, part of the, uh, new, uh, games are fun, uh, forum. And he posted that his copy

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.000
of EA's, uh, need for speed hot pursuit contained the online pass that was expired blocking

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.400
him from accessing, or accessing online content. And, uh, I guess there's a bunch of the people

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.520
that were saying that they ran into the same problem. And, uh, EA, uh, actually came out

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.040
and said EA's online passes indeed expire for some new games, blocking buyers out of

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:50.640
online content until they download a new pass or attain one from EA directly. Um, and it

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.760
apparently is as a rule, no online pass should expire, but a few titles will have a time

01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.880
limit on their use, even new purchases. Um, and dragon H2 for example, has an online pass

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:10.440
that expires March 31st, 2012. Um, and I guess according to their, uh, license agreement,

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:16.200
it's actually listed in there and says redownloading or getting a new pass is free. EA said, I'm

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.760
not sure if that means that they have to buy a new pass or if they just redownload the

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:27.720
old pass and it somehow changes the date or something. Um, and it's weird though that

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:34.240
they have, you know, they have this in the first place. Why, why even make these expired

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:50.080
to begin with? I don't understand why they would do that. Wait for it. Wait for it. Do

01:13:50.080 --> 01:14:00.440
I really need to say anything else? I mean, yeah, I just, I just don't understand why,

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.280
why they would do that in the first place. I mean, that would be like, for example, if

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.940
you bought download content, any download content for any game, because technically

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:15.000
these passes act like download content and it expires. Hey, hey, you know, you like playing

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.920
that Skyrim DLC. Hope you finished all your quests in it because it's expired. Unfortunately,

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:32.600
we made it out of meat. It's no good anymore. You can't consume this download content. You

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:46.080
will get sick. I mean, it's just it. I know. I know. I, what else needs to be said? It's

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.840
just one of those things where it's like this whole system is flawed and we keep getting

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.040
punished over and over again. And it's like, when is this shit going to stop? Oh, and they

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.800
even said that apparently, uh, Mass Effect 2 has the same thing and even says on the

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:10.680
actual card, it says, uh, the, was it the service network, whatever, um, activation.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:18.560
And it says it's code expires January 1st, 2012. So if you're planning on buying Mass

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:27.720
Effect 2, I hope you use that code already. SMH. That's all I have to say. SMH. Moving

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:33.280
on. You know, wait, no, not moving on. You know, in California we have this law and I

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.520
think some other states have it too. And so federal has certain protections about it.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:42.800
But like, like if you buy a gift card, like let's say I get Loki a $25 gift certificate

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:49.620
to the movie theater for his birthday. Okay. And he never uses it, but like three years

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:56.140
later he finds it. It's still worth $25. They can't deduct fees. They, if he wants to take

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:00.400
it in for certain amounts, I think it's like up to 10 or $25. He can actually go in and

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.960
say, I want the cash back. Then they have to give him the money for it. Like they have

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:11.920
to do that. So, um, it's really interesting to me that gaming companies have found a loophole

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.720
kind of around this where things can't, that are worth money like this can expire. I'm

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.440
going to tell you something else though. In the state of California, gift cards don't

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.920
expire. Oh yeah, yeah. So why is this stuff expire? I don't think it actually legally

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.000
would be able to in the state. They're not, see, but there's, it's not real money, quote

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.320
unquote. The online pass technically has no value. It does and it doesn't. It's, it's,

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.000
to me it seems like a legal loophole. The piece of paper doesn't have any value to it,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.600
but you've still bought the pass. You've still bought the card, but you didn't really buy

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:52.640
the pass. It was included with your new game. It still has a monetary value attached to

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.040
it. They're not, it's nothing that's going to be a game has a monetary value. The past

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:02.080
actually does have a monetary value. You didn't buy the game. Let's, I don't agree. I don't

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.560
agree with what I'm saying. I'm just being there. No, but it's nothing that would stand.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.040
Let's just look at it this way. Okay. What is, what are these passes trying to prevent

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.200
anyways? Piracy and use game sales. Okay. That's what they're, they're trying to prevent

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:21.840
with these things. What are they encouraging with all this stuff expiring piracy and use

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.640
game piracy? No. Well, here's the thing though. Pirates, I'm telling you pirates, it's not

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:32.500
a big deal because guess what? Pirates can download DLC for goddamn free and any of these

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.480
online passes that you happen to throw in their way. Guess what? You can download any

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:43.680
DLC for free. Now granted, if, you know, Mass Effect 2 or whatever, that's not a big deal.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.680
And you can't play online with, you know, a JTAG system or something like that, but

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.660
you can download all the download content. For example, Saints Row the Third. If you're

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:56.400
ever so inclined, you can download their online pass and you can system link with a friend

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.980
that may have, you know, a pirated copy of that as well because you both have a version

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:06.200
of that online pass download content that works just fine. Of course, legitimate consumers

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:11.640
that say maybe don't have internet access, you're fucked because guess what? THQ wants

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:17.280
to save some money and stop pirates, but really they're not because no one cares. Or they

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.680
can just get the stuff so readily available that it's not really an obstacle. It's just

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:28.560
a little minor inconvenience, I guess. I mean, and does it stop some use game sales? Maybe

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.800
it does. I think this stuff, you know, hiding it in the end user license agreement or in

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.920
tiny, tiny, tiny text in the back of a manual or on the bottom of a box or something like

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:46.600
that. It's not the way to go about it. I mean, if you bought this game used, let's say someone

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:53.680
decides to go buy Mass Effect 2 in January. Let's say they go and buy it in January and

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.320
they got this code, hey, sweet, I can get this free download content. And you go put

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:02.840
it in, code invalid, it's expired. I mean, when they kind of leave a little sour taste

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.160
in your mouth, wouldn't you think twice before buying a EA product again? And let's just

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.360
say they bought it. Brand new, because I mean, I'm sure Mass Effect 2 is still being sold.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.760
Hell, Mass Effect 3 isn't out yet and people may want to get in on the Mass Effect 2 franchise.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:24.360
I mean, that would kind of annoy me. That would be like, maybe, what? Well, you should

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:32.560
have been more of a fan of the game and bought it earlier. I mean, thanks. What I think it

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.560
comes down to, actually, though, Rob, is you see they probably have a scheduled plan of

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.540
when they're going to drop prices of these things and you see they work in the price

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:45.520
of, okay, we're going to get these people to buy the game for $60. Oh, now we're going

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.400
to drop it down to $20 and we're going to take the download vote.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.520
No, not, I think you're giving them too much credit, actually. I think you're giving them

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.720
too much credit to plan ahead. I think that's exactly what happened here is that people

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.640
didn't plan ahead. And I think that's what's really happening here is somebody put the

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.840
cart before the horse and implemented this whole thing before they thought about, well,

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.000
what about when these things expire? And then when that point came up, somebody just said,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:15.440
ah, fuck them. So that's what happens in boardrooms across America. Fuck them. Moving on, Verizon.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:21.320
I wanted to say fuck them too. Well, maybe, hopefully you feel a little better about Verizon,

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.140
but if not, well, fuck them too. But maybe this will make you feel a lot better about

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.360
Verizon because this sounds like it could be interesting. You know that whole streaming

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.200
TV stuff that's coming to the Xbox 360. Well, Verizon FiOS, I don't know what that is because

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.040
we don't have this here. I'm assuming that's kind of like AT&T U-verse.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:46.040
It's FiOS. It's fiber optic. Okay. Well, if you have this, you will be getting 26 channels

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:52.560
from this to your Xbox 360. If you are an Xbox Live Gold member and you already get

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:58.520
the FiOS TV and internet service. So in other words, as long as you could just turn on your

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.120
TV and get these channels, now you can pump them through your 360 as long as you have

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:12.480
gold as well. And you'll get 26 of the channels. I'm not sure I understand why this is awesome,

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:20.040
but everybody's reporting on it anyway. No, I'm with you because I, as far as, you know,

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.720
you can use voice and gesture commands through your Kinect. I don't care. That's something

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:33.880
your TV can't do. Once again, Xbox P break. Once again, why do I need to do that? Okay.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:40.080
I'm telling you in a race of reflexes, I'm sure I can hit the pause button on my remote

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.080
faster than someone can say pause. I mean, I'm sure there's a fraction of a second difference

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:56.520
there. Xbox pause. Did you ask for a puppy? No. Xbox pause. You want to watch jaws? Xbox

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:10.320
pause. It's just cannot identify you. Please face sensor. You're not old enough to watch

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:20.400
this programming. Here's the thing. I was excited about the whole TV service stuff for

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.880
stuff in addition to my cable company. Or like, for example, say if I'm ever so inclined

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:33.800
to get rid of cable and watch programming through their service, what's the point? If

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:39.520
I have to have cable to watch TV, I'm going to do it without an Xbox. I don't need to

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.920
buy an Xbox subscription to watch TV. Chat room to the rescue. The show where every gamer

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.780
has a voice. Here's the first legitimate purpose I see for this. Alpha Kinetogram in the chat.

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:58.500
If so, you can use your 360 as a spare cable TV box and not have to rent another one. Something

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:07.440
for the kids room. Loki, would he retort? I can just get another box and okay, that's

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:15.240
great. That's great. We can do that, I suppose. Um, but at the same time, I mean, I only watch

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:22.960
TV in one room. I don't need that. What about when Josh is 15 and wants his own damn TV

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.760
in his room? Then he can watch TV in his room because by then I'm sure we'll have something

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:34.280
better than the Xbox streaming. Shit, if we're still fucking using the Xbox 360 to stream

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:40.600
cable, we got a problem. I mean, hell, you can, you can get like dish installed like

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.680
four receivers or whatever. I'm not going to do that. Like they always say, but we could

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.920
install these receivers for you to watch TV in a bunch of different rooms. Like I'm only

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.000
one person. I can watch TV in one room at a time. I don't need four receivers. Why am

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.800
I going to want, Hey wife, I'm going to watch TV in a room that you're not in for some reason.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:08.020
Yeah. You know what? I have the internet. Fuck receivers. I'm already paying for a high

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.920
speed internet. That's my DVR. I can watch shit whenever I want on any system. And I

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.200
like how they have it where you can watch stuff on your like iPod and stuff like, well,

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.400
first off, I'm not going to squint my eyes that small till then you'll watch TV show

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.680
on my iPod. But um, yeah, it's kind of cool that they have it. Now if I could use my Xbox

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.280
360 as a DVR to DVR those programs and watch them later on, then yes, that would be an

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.040
added value. That would be fucking awesome. But they're not going to do that because then

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.560
that means cable company doesn't get money. Um, so they're of course not going to do that.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:46.680
So watching channels that I already can fucking watch on TV is no big deal. Now here's the

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.600
thing though that would interest me is if they're in HD because I currently don't pay

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.640
for the HD package because I chose to go the route. I was actually going to go the route

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.800
of no cable, but they said, Hey, for $2 extra, we can give you cable. And I'm like, okay,

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:09.400
two bucks. I can do that. $2. But it's actually, it's the additional stuff on top of like channels

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.760
that are not on my TV that I'm interested in. Like if they have like gaming channels

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.480
or something like ESPN Ocho, the Ocho. Now if they have additional stuff, that's kind

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.800
of what I'm interested in as far as like the stuff that's offered from Verizon or dish

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.680
or direct TV or whatever. Maybe a real gaming network about the console that's currently

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:38.360
powered on. How about that? Wouldn't that be something? You know what? JD Ross major

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.700
now Ross is not working. Major. Major Nelson could get 30 minutes instead of just one.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:51.840
Think about it. Could be the major Nelson hour majors could be the major Nelson channel.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:58.960
Just camera fixed on major Nelson all day long majors mini series. Maybe dark Sakura.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:05.960
We need another news story please. Um, animal crossing. This one's actually kind of different.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:13.040
Yeah, they say that now, but um, you actually play as the mayor and you can customize your

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.240
town and you have a secretary. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Now I'm the mayor. Now you're

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:22.280
the mayor. Do people have to do what I say? Probably. You also have a secretary named

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:30.360
Shizu and uh, the character models have been made according to this a little bit more lifelike

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.720
so that you've got differences between the animals so you can customize quite a bit differently

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:41.120
too. And your clothes, you have tops and bottoms and boys can wear skirts. So now that I'm

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:47.280
the mayor, will I be able to evict Tom Nook? I wish. Well you have to deal with problems.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.440
Like will all the animals like start occupying on your front lawn happen? We've got, am I

01:26:53.440 --> 01:27:00.440
going to have to send out, um, Rossetti to mace the villagers of the town? Can I finish

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:07.200
my story? Hands on mayor. I'm going to take this shit in my own hand. Grab a shovel. Well,

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:20.120
hit the bug net. It's time to discipline people. Can I finish reading my story, Rob? No. Okay.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.420
Rob shaking and crying. He's looking forward to this so much. I just wish somebody other

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:29.960
than Nintendo would make these games cause then they might be really funny. Well, you've

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.280
got a furniture shop where you can design your own cushions for your furniture. Uh,

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.360
you can make changes to your home exterior. You have fence posts, mailbox, basically

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:46.600
it's like the Sims with animals, but different. Uh, and the, the town's also bigger and has

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:55.800
a shopping mall and you have a huge beach and you can swim in the ocean. Ooh. And uh,

01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.880
you can actually exchange house designs with people, um, through street pass, like a model

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:11.400
home. Look, you know what this means? And draw Cox on him. Uh, Oh, uh, Oh. These street

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:21.720
paths has left his store. He has a new job. He's the town's real estate agent. Oh, great.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:29.960
Tom Nook's a little asshole, but no wonder the housing market's screwed. I just want

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.240
to the KK to be awesome in it forever. Tom Nook's foreclosing on people all over animal

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:47.560
crossing. Occupy Nooks. I'm just like, really? I'm switching to a really design your own

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.400
couch cushions. I don't fucking care. Well, I'm looking, Oh wow. You actually, your, your

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:59.160
little character looks a lot different. I thought those real people were like, Oh, that's

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:06.080
realistic. Some Japanese dude know what sad is they're trapped in your little town and

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.200
they have to sing and dance for you to get out. I'm looking at this little thing, which

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.600
I really shouldn't be, but I'm looking at it. Oh wait. Hey, I can look at it and then

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.560
the audio will play all over the feed for everybody to hear. That'll be fun. Let's see.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:26.400
Pull up the link here. Oh, it's all in Japanese. That's okay. We had a Japanese trailer earlier.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.000
Oh wow. The people actually do look quite a bit different. The little, the little characters.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:46.880
I mean the animals. This is kind of boring. When do we see the people? It's like peppered

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:57.640
throughout the video. All right. That video is about as exciting as animal crossing is

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:08.200
on the second day. Hey. All right. I'm probably going to get it in a 3DS. Let's move on. Loki.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:16.180
Um, well unfortunately it is the end of game pro. Um, they're going to cease publication

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:21.520
altogether just right after the decision to go quarterly. It will be their last issue

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:29.200
and uh, basically the website is shutting down tomorrow on the fifth and um, they're

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:36.000
done. So, uh, can I say something about that real quick? Yeah. Now I saw a lot of people

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.560
on Twitter kind of eulogizing this, which I completely understand you. I remember reading

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.380
game pro magazine when I was younger and it was, you know, one of the ways to get gaming

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:48.320
news and so forth. And I do kind of feel bad for the people that lost their jobs and so

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.860
forth through this because, you know, I bet a lot of these people probably read those

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:56.120
magazines growing up and really had a dream of working at game pro or working at a game

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:01.140
magazine and they got that and then, oh shit, it all changed. And now, you know, the job's

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:05.240
not there anymore that they wanted. I can see that's gotta be really depressing and

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.680
so forth. And there's a lot of people online kind of eulogizing game pro saying, can't

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.640
believe this happened. It's, it's sad that this happened. And I'm just thinking if everybody

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:19.120
that was eulogizing game pro actually bought the magazine or went to the website, it's

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.360
probably wouldn't have happened. You know, that make me a bitch for thinking that I was

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:28.240
in the store today. Oh, you're a bitch anyway. I was in the store today and I was walking

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:32.620
down the magazine aisle and I saw PC gamers sitting there. PC gamer. I used to buy it

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:39.000
all the time cause they'd have CDs full of demos and all this shit. PC gamer. I, as far

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.480
as I could tell, flipping through the magazine, no CD or DVD to be had whatsoever. $8.99 for

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.480
that fucking magazine. Fuck that. That's why I'm not buying magazines because they're too

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:57.320
goddamn expensive. And game pro, yeah, you know, um, it was great back in the day when

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.000
the internet wasn't around. Unfortunately now everything is digital and print magazines

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:08.800
unless you're owned by a big game store, an evil G store. Um, then you're not going to

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:16.080
do that well, unfortunately, because exclusives, you really have to buy them or somehow leverage

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:20.600
them out of these companies. And most of the stuff, you know, that may be in your magazines

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:27.120
already a month old by the time, you know, everything goes around. It's tough. You gotta

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:34.020
figure out content to put in there that doesn't require the time sensitive material. And that's

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.480
tough because that's what people want. That's why retro gamers are great magazine cause

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:44.640
you're not expecting to see new stuff in there. So anyhow, um, interesting comment from Game

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.960
Guru in the chat room. I checked the magazine rack at my grocery store and there was no

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:56.680
gaming magazine besides PC gamer. See my favorite magazine right now is actually, um, retro

01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:05.240
gamer. It's a British magazine. That's all old video games. The one I just mentioned.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:11.000
Retro gamer is a very, okay. And keep in mind my, my career, what I'm going to make a career

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.200
of is print publication. And I like seeing a magazine where they put time and effort

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:22.640
into it printed on nice glossy stock. Not to be Debbie Downer, but this news should

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:29.640
warn you it's going to be rough. I know. I got to tell you guys about this gaming magazine

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.600
that I've been reading and it's pretty cool because you'll never see really new games

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:41.960
in there. It's a magazine called retro gamer. I don't know if you've heard of it. Shut up.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.760
All right. All right. Um, another thing that unfortunately went by the wayside as well.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:54.240
Um, the website game set watch is ending its six year run. Um, basically what's going on

01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:00.680
there is, um, they're basically stopping because they're having a lot of overlap with their

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:06.240
sister site, indie games.com. And so they're just saying, you know, in terms of some of

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.480
the best material out there is being indie related. Uh, they're just going to kind of

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:17.000
focus mainly on indie games.com. Also mainstream game blogs are doing much better job nowadays,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.420
including the weirder and alt links and among the other gaming news. Yeah, I think a lot

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:27.000
of these gaming websites, to be honest nowadays are just including all these bizarro stuff.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.760
Oh, hey, one game blog covered it. Let me cover it as well. And I mean, Kotaku, I read

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:41.760
you daily and joystick, you know, um, Kotaku. I mean, seriously, some of your editors, I

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.600
don't need to see every goddamn Skyrim video that you think is funny. Uh, you know, how

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.160
many videos can I watch? Someone's spawning cheese and having to roll it down a Hill.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:54.320
I mean, yeah, it's funny. The first time it's funny, but I don't, I don't need to see that

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.520
every single time. But, um, you know, I, I, I don't know. Yeah, there's a lot of, a lot

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:06.000
of sites out there for getting your news kind of one of the reasons why I just, you know,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.920
why we don't really cover a lot of the news because I mean, really do you need another

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.960
source for, you know, website? No, we do talk about news, but just what we do is to have

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.540
some play. I have some walls. I mean, it once again, it's, it's all about, you know, hey,

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:26.320
we all have day jobs, um, it in our own lives and stuff. I mean, it's, once again, it's,

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.380
we're not going to be there, you know, right away unless we have some sort of scoop on

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:36.600
something, which is not very often cause we're not doing this professionally. Um, that it's

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.600
impossible for, you know, anybody to try to keep up with these sites because these sites

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.900
are run by multiple people, lots of people, whole staffs and stuff like that. And we're

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:56.700
just a few people and we just can't do it. So we concede. All right. Uh, moving on. Since

01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:01.700
Loki talked about, uh, how much he, uh, it gets sees a Skyrim information over saturating

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:06.580
the internet. Let's talk about Skyrim and a Skyrim had a 1.2 update that rolled out

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:12.260
this week. A PlayStation three, X-Box three 60 and PC. And apparently, Oh, not doing too

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:16.800
good. It's, it's kind of buggy. A lot of users are reporting. Various issues are going on

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.680
with the game. Uh, apparently the game now doesn't recognize magic resistance. That could

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.500
be an issue. Think about it. Yeah. The bug list is quite funny actually down the bottom

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:30.700
there. Uh, this, this here unofficial bug list. Oh, let me look at that. Just mentioning

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.800
some of the things. All right, let's look at this. Oh, is this like, Oh, something.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.780
Somebody actually posted this on their own forums. Good Lord. Well, it's actually the

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:42.340
Bethesda forums. Yes. Yeah. But this isn't Bethesda that posted this. It's an unofficial

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:48.300
list. Yikes. Let's see. The dark brotherhood. Cal does not show a face mask. Only seems

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:54.460
to work for females, but doesn't show up for males. Hmm. Um, Oh, what, where's the funny

01:36:54.460 --> 01:37:01.180
stuff? Well, character's getting stuck running. Um, you know, well obviously the, uh, resistance

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:08.440
is not being there. Uh, dragons flame backwards or erratic destruction. Trainers are not letting

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:16.140
me train. Markarth guards always try to arrest the player. Invisibility is being undone by

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:22.420
the shadow warrior perk for sworn conspiracy when going back to meet L tree players sometimes

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:29.980
finds him dead. Oh, uh, this is a funny one. Uh, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers was telling

01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:34.980
me about, uh, he was playing and I guess one of his followers died. I think it might've

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:40.540
been Lydia. Um, cause she's the first, like, well, not really the first floor, but the,

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:46.900
the one you get appointed to by the URL. And, um, so apparently she got smashed by a troll

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:52.600
or a giant. She got smashed by a giant. Well, she didn't die. She kind of resurrected herself,

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.700
but she was still flat. And so she slipped around like a snake for about eight hours

01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:03.680
in game. And then he was telling me also later on the game, like another person had died.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.300
And so he's getting married or whatever. And like everybody keeps like walking in there.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.460
This is just an outrage. This is disgusting. This bride keeps like storming off and stuff

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.620
like that. He's kept reloading and seems like, what the hell is going on? I can't fucking

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:20.220
understand what's going on. Looks down. There's the corpse of the person that died like days

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:27.860
ago and just like somehow teleported to your wedding. He wanted to come see it. But yeah,

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:32.100
I remember one of the patch bugs was like preventing people that have died from appearing

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:39.280
at your wedding dead. That's always a bummer. Um, I guess dragons are flying backwards.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.720
That's another big thing that's going on right now. That's great. Well, Bethesda has come

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.560
out and said, you know, we, uh, promised to be more careful with patches in the future.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:55.040
And my friend put up a video, by the way, of finding a monk, a dead monk in a jail cell,

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:01.900
except he looked like he was, uh, spasming all over the place. All right. LOL. Skyrim's

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.120
buggy. We get it. Let's move on to when games weren't so goddamn buggy. I mean, as great

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.980
as the game of Skyrim is, geez, it's kind of buggy. And, uh, you know, we didn't remember

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.900
when they couldn't patch games. Remember when games had to be perfect when they were sold?

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:20.060
Oh, you mean like on the Wii? And if you were gonna, if you were gonna patch him, you just

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:26.140
released a new game. We're going to take a step back to simpler times. Maybe it's a Wii

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.180
game this week, apparently, since now that's a classic gaming system. It's not a Wii game.

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:39.500
It's a classic game of the week. The classic game is a game that I've actually done the

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.500
full version of before, but I haven't done this specifically. So fuck it, I'm doing Christmas

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:52.980
Nights. It's my family tradition, dammit. So, um, basically, you, you know, fly around,

01:39:52.980 --> 01:40:01.540
collect balls, put them in the idea cap, uh, machine, and go fight a boss. Yay. What? Nothing.

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:05.740
Just the way you described that just now reminded me of that South Park episode with the manatees

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:12.140
that put the balls in for the, you know, the family guy jokes. I never saw it. Sorry. Anyway,

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.860
with Christmas Nights, it was actually a special freebie that was released in December, 1986

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:23.780
in Japan. It came with this Christmas Saturn bundle. And everywhere else, it was given

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:28.820
away with a purchase of certain games like Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition and

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:35.580
was bundled with Sega Saturn Magazine, Game Players, and Net Generation Magazine. Um,

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:41.340
it actually, though, um, if you got the magazine, the Sega Saturn Magazine version, it didn't

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:45.780
have a slip cover. It just had a, a transparent one. Um, but it has its own, like, little

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.340
special cover. In Japan, though, my friend has the Japanese version of this. It got its

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:55.860
own jewel case and everything. Sucks. So with this one, um, it has the full version of,

01:40:55.860 --> 01:41:01.420
um, one of Claris' levels, Spring Valley. Um, but both Claris and Elliot can play through

01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:06.300
it. Um, Elliot couldn't in the full game. And he has a different layout than Claris'

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:11.420
one. This is actually a little harder. So basically, um, the way the story goes is that

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:16.220
they, uh, notice that something is missing and it's the star off the Christmas tree in

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:22.220
the center of town. So they go into Mytopia to find it and look up at nights and do stuff.

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:32.220
Um, at any rate, um, it uses the Saturn's clock to change modes in it. Um, in November

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:38.380
and January, the title says Nights Limited Edition. Well, it did say Nights Limited Edition,

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:45.420
but it changed to Winter Nights. In December, it becomes Christmas Nights. Um, and then

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:51.580
the entire, uh, area that you go through instead of being all springtimey turns into wintry

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:57.900
places. And the Nightopians wear elf costumes and Christmas trees instead of the idea capture.

01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:04.300
Um, you have, uh, presents everywhere. The music, as you can hear, is like a different

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.100
version of Jingle Bells. Can you turn it up a little bit, Rob?

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:24.540
There's also, um, the other changes in the game. Um, well, you also do have to fight

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.900
the, um, the boss, which is Gilling from, of course, the last one, and save the star

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.260
from his lair, which is actually attached to his butt. And it's really fun and cool.

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:40.140
Now, the other neat stuff that happens is that, um, the weather in Spring Valley will

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:45.020
change depending on the hour. And then you've got changes on New Year's Day and April Fool's

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:49.740
Day, where instead of playing Nights, you play as Diala, which is pretty cool. It also

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:54.460
has a ton of hidden goodies in it. Like, one of the things that we unlocked last night was,

01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:01.580
um, the trailer from Tokyo Game Show in 1996 when the game came out. Um, they call it Christmas

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:06.460
presents mode. You get, like, a time attack. You can get a special Link challenge. And

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:12.300
you also get a special level called Sonic the Hedgehog and the Dreams. So, Sonic goes

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:20.860
through Spring Valley on foot. And, um, you fight, uh, a bouncy ball version of Robotnik

01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:26.460
slash Eggman. And the music is a remixed version of Final Fever, which was the final boss music

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:30.620
from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD. As I'm sure I've mentioned before,

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:36.300
they changed the US music. So, it's really neat. It's got lots of fun little stuff in it.

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:41.660
You know, there's even a karaoke mode, which you can sing the little theme song. And it's

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:48.620
really fun. So, it was a freebie, which was even better. So, this is back in the day when,

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:55.660
you know, they would do nice shit for us. Don't you remember? I do. So, that's your classic game,

01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:02.300
Mr. Christmas Nights. Ho, ho, ho. There it is. Yeah, I love also children's books.

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:11.580
There you go. Yeah. Christmas Nights.

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:16.220
There it is, your classic game of the week. So, so time appropriate. I appreciate that.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.340
We're going to take a quick break, guys. But when we come back, there's plenty more Orange

01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:23.180
Laundry to come. We're going to talk about a brand new role-playing game that was announced

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:28.540
this past week. That's going to be, uh, Lolsy. Uh, a special email bag. Somebody managed to get

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.820
an email in anyway, even though the email's down. We'll explain how that worked in a little bit.

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.300
And another game going free to play. We're going to talk about all that when we come back with

01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:47.740
more of Orange Lounge Radio. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:55.100
this Sunday evening, December the 4th of 2011 with the 437th episode of our show. This show's been

01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:00.700
going on a long time. I just want to point out. Every time you say the 37, I want to go in a row.

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:05.180
Right. Yeah. So during the break, uh, the chatters were asking about, since we were talking about

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:09.180
Christmas nights before the break, kind of had people thinking about the holidays and some folks

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:13.420
were asking, are you guys doing a show on Christmas? And so we were sitting here thinking

01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:20.300
like, well, Dark Sakura doesn't really do Christmas now. I mean, you do, but you don't. Well, it's kind

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:26.540
of like a non-issue thing, right? Dan and I do Christmas Eve. Okay. And, and then we'd go to

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:32.380
family stuff to eat free food. And we're doing stuff with, um, now Alan and I are doing stuff

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:37.660
with Alan's side of the family, but I don't know when that'll be done. We might be done by, I seem

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.700
to remember last year, we were kind of out of there about like four or five. So we'll see,

01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:44.300
but I don't want to rush it. So I don't know if we're going to do a show on Christmas or not.

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:50.300
Probably not, but never say never. Right. So I suggested to Rob that we get Chinese food and

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.700
eat it live on air. It would be fun to do a Chinese food Christmas special, but you know,

01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:00.620
we'll see. Um, anyhow, uh, we'll let you know a little closer to the date, but probably not you

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:05.500
guys. Um, the good news is the next week, uh, should be easy. So we'll have one week off for

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:10.300
the holidays and that should be it. Um, we'll let you know more about that in the next couple of

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:14.060
weeks. Cause believe it or not what Christmas is only about what three weeks away from today.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:20.460
So yikes. All right. Jester Scott in our chat room says, take a day off peeps.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:24.780
That's true. We deserve a day off. That's what we're getting for the holidays. A day off.

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:31.180
Let's go to Disneyland. Don't even tempt me. All right. We're going to get back into some more

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:35.340
gaming news. Uh, your calls coming up a little later on as well as your tweets. Make sure you

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.940
get your tweets in because especially since the email bag has been down this week, we're really

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.020
relying on your tweets. So get those into twitter.com slash O L R. We don't have quite as

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:48.220
much news this half of the show as we did in the first half of the show. So we definitely need your

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:53.820
calls and tweets tonight. So do we have a, do we have a work injury? What's going on? Dark Sockar

01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.540
says she has a splinter. I have a splinter. All right, go do what you need to do. All right.

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:02.620
Loki will read some news. We'll take care of it. Loki, let's get back to some gaming news.

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:06.780
I'll do the news, I guess. Uh, so let's talk a little bit about

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:15.180
Zynga and apparently they were attempting to acquire Rovio, the creators of

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:23.260
a franchise with angry birds in it. Um, they were, apparently Rovio actually rejected an offer for

01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:31.500
2.25 billion dollar acquisition from Zynga. So that's, that's a lot of pride right there.

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:39.100
Good for them. That's what I have to say. Good, good for them that they rejected that offer from

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:45.260
Zynga because, you know, Zynga is kind of not the, um, I don't know, Zynga is kind of like,

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:51.260
you know how Google says do no evil? Well, Zynga does evil. That's kind of what they do. And that's

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:59.820
what they do best is evil stuff like Facebook and all that stuff. So, so Loki, why don't you do one

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:06.220
more story since Dark Sockar's out of the room. Why don't you, um, tell us about that role playing

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:16.060
game that's coming out very soon. If you can load up the story here if it, if it'll work.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:24.540
All right. Sweet. Um, let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is great. South Park, you know,

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:34.060
they've had a lot of, eh, okay games and then of course they have to go and, and Dark Sockar is

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:41.340
bleeding apparently. No, um, and now it's come out to say something nasty, but I didn't. Thank God.

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:46.300
I, I appreciate that you did not say I was going to take it there. And then I said, you know what,

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.460
I'm not going to take it there. Um, you know, that would explain a lot about why she's so upset.

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:56.860
Uh, yeah. You know what? I know that Alan would really like for you to come home. Eventually

01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:01.100
South Park. You were saying South Park. Uh, they have a, well, they have an Xbox live arcade game.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:06.860
The, uh, the kind of side scroller co-op game, the South Park's Tenorman's Revenge, which is coming

01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:10.060
out a little bit later on, but this isn't what we're talking about. We're talking about what was

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:15.340
revealed from the new cover of Game Informer. Once again, a magazine that's owned by a big company

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:22.140
that can get exclusives when no one else can. Um, they have a new South Park game. Get the covers

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.820
already on the internet before it's in your mailbox. Well, they, they pimp that out usually

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:33.340
early on the Game Informer site. Um, they have a new RPG coming from Obsidian, the folks behind

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:40.140
the latest, uh, Fallout New Vegas. And, uh, it is going to be an RPG. And, uh, of course,

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:46.940
all 2D and everything. Um, it's supposed to be released second half of 2012 on Xbox 360,

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:53.260
PlayStation 3, and PC. And, uh, what's kind of cool about it though is they also have, uh,

01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:58.620
some details out about it. Including that, well, first off, the game is supposed to be about

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:04.300
you fitting in, I guess. And they're gonna have, you know, different characters that'll be

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:09.580
completely customizable. Um, also you'll be able to, you know, choose different classes and stuff

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:16.860
like that. Um, and, uh, I think it's pretty awesome looking. They're saying it's gonna

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:21.180
combine, like, a bunch of different things. The combat system will mirror Paper Mario.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:27.180
Uh, the weapon augmentation will kind of be inspired by Final Fantasy's Materia system from

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:35.340
7. Um, also they're saying that, of course, the entire game's gonna be 2D. Um, or at least look

01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:40.060
hand drawn, I guess. I gotta say I'm a little worried though because the other South Park games

01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.460
that have come out today have been kind of crappy. Granted, this is a new company doing this. Like,

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:48.380
who did the Nintendo 64 one? That was a claim, like, back in the day, wasn't it? And that one,

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:52.380
that was that first person shooter. It really wasn't that good. So, I mean, you know, there's

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.940
been, and there's been, like, Xbox Live arcade games, like, you know, there was the Let's Play

01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:01.020
Tower Defense and all this. But there haven't been a lot of, like, really good South Park games. But

01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:04.940
I think a lot of that is because Matt and Trey haven't really been involved. But it sounds like

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.980
they're involving themselves in this. Like, you know, some of the stuff I was reading about,

01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:13.100
like, how they actually designed what the town square would look like. They gave feedback to the

01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:18.700
designers. Like, the designers wanted to do, like, Ike got kidnapped as a wolf as, like,

01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:25.020
a story in the game or something. And the creators are like, no. So, it's good that it has their

01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:33.020
input. Yes. I don't know. I'm excited. I'd buy it. Yeah. I'll definitely check that out. I mean,

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:39.500
you know, the demo and so forth is very important. But it's so funny that South Park is still going

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:42.780
after all these years. I mean, it's kind of like The Simpsons too. God, The Simpsons has been on

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:48.380
forever. The Simpsons is still going. But making me feel old, South Park started my first year of

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:55.660
college. I was, what, 97 and it's still on the air. And people talk about, boy, South Park is so

01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:02.540
old. Which means I'm so old. All right. Rob. What? I'm older than you. Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:10.940
All right. Moving on. There's always rumors about what is coming next on Microsoft's front. And this

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:17.500
isn't specifically about the Xbox loop. But this is about the Kinect 2. Which I could have sworn

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.420
we were talking about some of this last week. But for whatever reason... How are we talking about

01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:26.860
Kinect for PC? I think so. But I guess some of the same shit's coming up all over again this week.

01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:32.540
So, here's the deal. Apparently, Microsoft has some big plans for the next Kinect. And Kinect

01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:37.180
2 is supposed to have improved motion tracking and voice recognition, which is to be expected,

01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:41.340
right? A more high def camera is all you really need. And maybe a better microphone in there. I

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.740
don't know. Or a higher sound sampling. But apparently, it's gonna have some other technical

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.860
stuff in it as well. It's going to be able to read lips. It will be able to detect the direction

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:58.060
that you're facing and recognize your emotional state. It's a little bit creepy. Why are you so

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:03.660
sad? I'm not sad. Why are you sad? Yeah, that's what I need. My Xbox. Because I don't hear it

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:09.740
enough on Xbox Live, I now need the Xbox device itself to sit there and go, you mad? You mad? And

01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:16.140
start teabagging me. That's exactly what I want my Xbox to do, IRL. Well, look, a lot of this is just

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:20.540
what? A lot of this is just higher resolution cameras in the device. The fact that it would

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:24.460
be able to read lips and sign language and all that isn't that much surprising. It was stuff

01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:27.420
that they were talking about doing with the original one, but they didn't have high enough

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:31.820
camera resolution. It didn't have the power! But now it will have the power, I'm assuming,

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:36.140
if there's going to be a Kinect 2 or whatever with the Xbox lube whenever it comes out.

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:42.700
So apparently one of the reasons why it's going to be more powerful, it will not utilize USB,

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:46.220
and therefore it's not going to be hampered by the USB speeds.

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:51.100
This is why the Kinect right now is somewhat limited. So there you go.

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:59.580
You know, the lip reading thing though could be pretty amazing. I mean, especially for

01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:05.500
what it could mean for disabled gamers and so forth, or folks, you know. It's going to be

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:10.460
really neat, I think. It's starting to feel like an Apple commercial now, like when they showed

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:14.700
FaceTime for the first time and how deaf people were using FaceTime to kind of have phone calls.

01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:18.300
So it's pretty awesome. So it's going to be neat to see what the Kinect can kind of open up

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.860
in that regard. That's cool.

01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:24.620
Yeah, very cool. It seems like it's really one of those cases where it's like,

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.500
the technology's here, it's just we're not ready to roll it out yet.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:34.060
So there you go. All right, we're going to go to our email bag. Now, here's the thing.

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:39.500
We don't really have like a normal email address right now, but it will be back this week. I would

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:45.500
say after Wednesday, you should be good to send in your emails again, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:50.060
However, in the interim, I taped my other show, Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:54.620
Azeroth, hoardhouse.com, a show all about World of Warcraft this morning. And one of our special

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:59.420
guests all the way from the other side of the pond, Sill, beat me on Skype and said,

01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:03.100
I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. And I said, well, we don't have an email right

01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:06.860
now. She said, but I really want to send Orange Laundry to an email. I said, okay, send it to me

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:13.100
and I'll have Jamie read it. And yeah, I know the topic she's talking about tonight is one that we

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:17.260
kind of tried to avoid, but that's all right. It's where every gamer has a voice. Let's,

01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:19.580
let's talk about it. It's Dark Soccer. Would you read the email please?

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.700
Hello guys. Where's my music?

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:27.180
We also, oh shit. That's right. You need mailbag music. We also love Sill and we'll do whatever

01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.340
she wants. I mean, really at the end of the day, right?

01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:31.100
Sill is my hero.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:31.580
That's right.

01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:37.740
Email.

01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:43.740
Hello guys. I'm so sorry for what happened to the website and I hope it will be,

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:47.740
I'll be resolved quickly. Now I'm not sure if this has caught your eye just yet,

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:52.380
but it seriously made me facepalm and I'm not even giving anybody the address because

01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.180
it's retarded. It's called Mario Kills Tanuki. It's on the PETA website. If you really want to

01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.540
find it, find it. But I don't care.

01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.780
It also was kind of all over the gaming community around the week before Thanksgiving. So

01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.100
I think a lot of people heard of this.

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:11.660
I really hate how an organization, even if it is tongue in cheek, how they called it in the end,

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:16.300
points a finger to gamers and tell us that we are being influenced by games and how they rot our

01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:20.540
inner beings and morals. I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.500
felt the need to skin my cat or wear him like a hat. What is your feeling about what PETA did

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.980
here? I just can't see anyone becoming a fur lover because of a game unless Jamie is eyeing

01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:34.380
up Shermie now and taking measurements. Then I haven't said anything. Love the show.

01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.020
So first of all, Shermie.

01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.260
Oh, the hell is that ringtone?

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:46.220
My friend Carly, her ringtone on my phone is bitches by mindless self-indulgence.

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:51.500
Okay. Um, apparently she doesn't realize I'm doing a show right now. So, um,

01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:59.420
what I, what the fuck was I saying? Oh yeah. First of all, PETA is a bullshit company.

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:03.100
It's a bullshit organization. They put more animals to sleep,

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:11.180
or I should just say they murder more animals than they help. They're second in command.

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:17.180
Um, even though they say don't use any medicines that were a result of testing on animals, um,

01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:24.300
they're, uh, second in their organization is a diabetic and uses animal derived insulin.

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:33.660
Just saying. Their main leader is a sociopath who, um, basically has stated that she would rather

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:41.260
all humanity die than have and have the world ruled by animals. So just throw that out there.

01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:44.540
She's crazy. Oh, but animals are so fuzzy wuzzy.

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:49.100
No, she says that she wants all humans to die. Okay.

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:56.700
So, um, Ingrid Newman, I think is her name. So anyway, we've got this organization

01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:04.140
that is clearly so poorly run and uses nothing but propaganda to fuel their agenda that are

01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:10.140
we surprised at all that they're using more propaganda to get attention and strike at,

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:14.300
you know, basically their target age group, which is gamer age. You know,

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:18.060
they're trying to get, get them young, get them in our, our little bracket.

01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:21.420
Cause we're really the ones that are going to be the movers and shakers in the world.

01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:27.020
PETA makes so much money. PETA is smart. They are very smart

01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:32.140
because they know that the gaming community is a very passionate community. This isn't the first

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:37.340
time they've done something like this and they know that they will get completely free

01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:41.820
advertising for a very long time from doing something like this. I like how they kind of

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:46.860
went back on it and said, Oh, it's just a joke, but whatever they're like weird ass reasoning

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:52.300
was or whatever, an audience that usually wouldn't give this organization a second thought,

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.860
the majority of which probably this already wouldn't give him a second thought,

01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.900
couldn't stop talking about it for several days because it was a very slow news period.

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:03.100
It was the week. We didn't, I remember when this came up because this week we didn't have

01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:08.460
a show unexpectedly. Remember? So that's when this all kind of came up. So, you know,

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:13.580
PETA is very smart at what they're doing. And this is all part of a calculated plan to drive

01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:20.220
more eyes to their site because it's kind of like a spammer. It's like you sit there in your inbox

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:25.420
and go, how many people really fall for these Nigerian print schemes or the, you won the lottery

01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:29.020
or congratulations, you're really the million- Make it Asian boobs! You're really the millionth

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:34.620
visitor to this website and you really did win this. But if one person falls for it, then-

01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:41.020
I wish I had not clicked the link because I hate, I delete every PETA link that's in my

01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:47.500
every PETA link that's in my viewing history. No, seriously. They don't get, I do not give them

01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:55.100
attention. Let me, what I think is interesting about Sil's email is what she's really framing

01:59:55.100 --> 02:00:02.140
it as in that paragraph there is she says, I really hate how an organization can tell us that

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:09.100
we are being influenced by games. Yeah. I thought that was really important because that is not

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:14.700
unique to PETA. That is absolutely not unique to this organization. This is just the most recent

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:22.460
example of this is that there's a lot of people out there, including many people that run for

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:28.140
political office, mind you. This is far and above any organization. People that actually wield

02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:36.060
actual power that think gamers are stupid. Gamers are easily influenced. Gamers care nothing about

02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:41.340
more than about, you know, Red Bull and a high score in their video game or whatever it is.

02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:47.500
You know, like there's a lot of ignorance out there in the political world for gamers when

02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:52.940
the reality is, especially now, thanks to Facebook, guess what? We're all gamers.

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:59.580
And I think that's why you saw quite a backlash this time to what PETA was doing

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:04.380
as opposed to what they were doing before. When PETA made fun of what was it? Super Meat Boy was

02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:08.380
one of the games they did before. They did a Cooking Mama one too. Most people don't know

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:15.340
Super Meat Boy. Most people don't know Cooking Mama. Everybody fucking knows Mario and especially

02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:21.420
Mario 3. What person in their 20s or 30s or hell, even most teens that weren't born when this game

02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:29.580
came out, what person under the age of 35 doesn't know Super Mario Brothers 3? Or older. I mean,

02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:34.460
really. My mother played the game with me. Sure. Sure. You don't have to. But I'm just saying,

02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:38.220
once you get above a certain age, you find more people that may truly not have known it because,

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:42.620
you know, video games, that's what the crazy kids are into. But if they're older and had kids,

02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:49.020
they know it through their kids. You know? Because I knew plenty of my friends, their parents played

02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:56.220
Mario with them. And that's why I think PETA had to come back and say, oh, we were just trolling

02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:01.500
because people literally this time looked at him and went, no, no, no. I know this Mario game and

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:07.340
you're being stupid. Yeah. People wouldn't defend a game like Super Meat Boy or Cooking Mama like

02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:12.780
that that they didn't know. But the public consciousness of Mario Brothers and the Tanooki

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:17.900
suit, like, here's the thing. And it still goes on in the email to say something like,

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.700
I used to play Super Mario 3 and after playing that game, I never felt the need to skin my cat

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:27.180
and wear him like a hat. But I think what a lot of kids, you know, as silly as that analogy is,

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:31.580
I think what a lot of kids did do, especially like, watch six and seven-year-olds when they

02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:35.820
play. A lot of them are little freaks. And I mean that in a good way. But a lot of them will pretend

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:41.020
to be Tanooki Mario, like, oh, I'm flying or I'm a Tanooki statue. You know, they'll stay. I mean,

02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:44.700
and you kind of look at them and you go, oh, kids are so dumb. But guess what? When you were six or

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:50.540
seven, you were that dumb. Yeah. So you didn't want to skin your cat. You just wanted to be

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:55.420
Tanooki Mario. Mario was your freaking hero. Sure me, baby. I'm not going to skin you,

02:02:55.420 --> 02:03:00.300
but I will use you as socks. All I have to do is have her sit on my feet. Anyway. But anyway,

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:05.580
my point is that's why a lot of people, because that was our reaction to Mario was that I didn't

02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:10.620
want to skin the cat. I wanted to be, I wanted to be a statue. I wanted the freaking Hammer

02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:15.100
Brothers suit. I wanted to save the princess. You know, that's because we were six, seven,

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:19.340
whatever age when this game came out. I wanted to throw hammers at people. PETA, you're being dumb.

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:24.540
I wanted to throw hammers at people. So yeah, no, seriously. That was my point. Yeah. Well,

02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:31.100
I actually did want to hop around in a giant shoe once, but, but I mean, now this could still

02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:36.380
happen. We could still make that dream come true. By the way, Rob, you did bring up another point

02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:41.420
that I would like to, um, to bring up to our listeners of voting age. Sure. And then I want

02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:47.900
to go to the chat room. Okay. Um, the people with power are trying to make these decisions for us

02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:56.860
and your, basically every time that you say, fuck it. Every time you say, I don't, I can't make a

02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:08.220
difference or I don't feel like it. Every time you display, um, apathy, you're basically saying,

02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:14.380
do whatever you want to. I don't care. That means the shit that's going on in the world right now,

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:20.700
right now that you're sitting back and bitching about is partly your fault because you didn't

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:25.580
vote for the people who need to make, who need to be the ones to make the change. You get enough

02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:30.540
people off of their asses voting for the people that are going to make a difference using their

02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:35.020
money wisely, actually making a difference in their own lives and their own communities.

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:42.220
We'll see change then. Very serious point and very much needed. And I think everybody better

02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:46.140
make sure they vote or you can't complain about these like things like SOPA and things like that

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:49.660
because you elected these people. My third catch phrase then, because you know, my first one is

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:53.500
welcome to the fantasy zone and get ready. The system is only as good as the games that are on

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:57.580
it. And number three change doesn't happen until you make it happen. Well, I thought it was going

02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:02.300
to be reject false icons, but that works. I stole from gorillas. All right. Fair enough. Um, I want

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:05.980
to technically, I stole the first one from space Harrier. Let me go to some lols from our chat room

02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.900
because the chat room is bringing the lols and it's talking about Tanuki Mario. Uh, Kaijuto in

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:14.700
chat says I'm an adult and I still pretend I'm Tanuki Mario. Uh, DDR dollar bill says the only

02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:20.060
time I pretend I'm in the raccoon suit is when I'm stoned. Um, let's see. Um, Tiger claw in our

02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:24.540
chat says these politicians would rather these gamers play actual games outside than stay indoors.

02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:31.420
Um, and also says PETA never complained about angry birds, a game where you slingshot birds

02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:39.820
into buildings. All I have to say, wait. Yeah, but I have no respect for people who don't vote,

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:46.620
including my husband. Well, unless you're, you know, 17. Well, if you're a voting age,

02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:55.180
and if you're a lazy ass, have them send your ballot to your house and then you mail it back in.

02:05:55.180 --> 02:06:02.540
You know what that requires? Walking to the mailbox. All right. Act F says, sadly,

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:07.980
I don't live in the US. Well, I meant for people who live here, people who can vote,

02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:11.500
people who have the, in your own country, if you live somewhere where you can vote,

02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:17.420
your votes matter in your country, in your community, you make the difference in your own

02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:22.860
damn community. Take some responsibility for what goes on in your life. The end. All right.

02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:28.780
I think Dark Sakura is ready for the FUs of the week, or maybe she already did it. Let's use it

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:54.460
anyway. My FU goes to bones006 today. Um, who, uh, can't spell. What has an H in it. The word is

02:06:54.460 --> 02:07:01.900
about, about, B-O-U-T is like a battle or a match. People have spelled P-E-O-P-L-E,

02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:05.500
can't has an apostrophe in it and appeared. You are part of what is wrong with the country

02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:13.500
and everybody else fucking vote. All right. Okay. Um, oh boy.

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:19.340
I guess I'd just say, uh, F-U-2 and not having more time to play Skyrim.

02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:28.060
There's only so much time in the day. Uh, my FU of the week just goes to like being like

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:33.740
really, really busy and just, there is so much going on right now. And like, you know,

02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:37.340
like somebody said to me last night, like, oh, boo, boo, you have the biggest problem that you

02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:43.020
have too much on your social calendar to do, but I just, it can be exhausting and just, you know,

02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:46.780
sometimes you have to kind of pick and choose what events you're going to go to and you don't

02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:52.860
want to piss people off. It's just, uh, it's just rough. So F-U all that.

02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:01.020
The holidays are about loving, damn it. I actually do have a little tiny one.

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:08.540
All right. People, um, F-U to everybody who says that Christmas isn't, is becoming less Christian

02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:16.220
because it wasn't Christian to begin with. It was very, very, very, very pagan. The end.

02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:20.220
Can't we all just get along? Oh, come on. It was about burning trees.

02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:25.340
How is that not pagan? Did Jesus have fir trees in Nazareth?

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:29.260
No, cause fir trees didn't grow in Nazareth. No, but he could make water into wine.

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:36.940
He also wasn't, nevermind. Oh, so I have to, I have to say this. My mom, my mom tried to have

02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:40.060
this argument with me and you were there for that. That's where the gay pie party came from.

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:44.860
She says, well, what would, how would you feel if they tried to take the menorah out of Hanukkah?

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:53.580
Um, Hanukkah was always Jewish. Um, yeah, that made no sense, mom.

02:08:54.140 --> 02:09:00.380
Well, also the word menorah is not in Hanukkah. No, it's actually a menorah is a Hebrew word for

02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:07.500
a candelabra. The technical term is a Hanukiah. So it is. How about some rapid fire gaming news?

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:12.780
Loki, you have a lot of news to talk to us about. We're going to quickly go through some stories.

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:19.180
Let's talk about Rhythm Heaven. It's coming to, uh, the Wii in the North America in February,

02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:25.660
uh, Rhythm Heaven Fever. And, um, this was announced via Nintendo Power. So I would say

02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:33.820
that's pretty legitimate. And, um, I hate the game to be honest. I played it on the DS, did not care

02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:38.140
for Rhythm Heaven. Just not my thing. Some people are really into it though. Yeah. If you like

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:43.340
rhythm, I haven't played it enough. You like rhythm games and, um, by all means, uh, go ahead and check

02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:49.420
it out. Of course, there was supposed to be a firmware update coming for the 3DS that would allow

02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:56.620
you to shoot some 3D video. Yeah, that didn't quite make it out in time. It is scheduled though for

02:09:56.620 --> 02:10:02.940
this week on December 8th. So you can look forward to that. And of course that will give you, uh, the

02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:09.980
3D video recording functionality as well as new StreetPass games and the 3DS to 3DS transfer service

02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:17.980
and DLC infrastructure so that you may be able to download DLC for titles later on. So more Mario

02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:25.580
Kart tracks we can only hope. Um, Microsoft is accepting betas into Microsoft Flight. It is going

02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:33.500
to be a brand new, um, Microsoft Flight sim. And, uh, of course, they haven't really unveiled too

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:38.700
many details for it yet, but hey, that might be kind of exciting for people that are fans of that

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:46.780
series. It's definitely popular. So, yeah, it'd be cool. And then of course, um, last but not least,

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:52.060
um, or actually this isn't even close to last year. I kind of thought that they already had something

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:58.780
like this, but it's still neat to see anyways. There's a new device out called the Supaboy. And

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:04.780
what the Supaboy does is allows you to play, uh, Super Nintendo cartridges, actual Super Nintendo

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:11.020
cartridges, on the go. It's one of those devices that you can play, um, it's like a handheld system

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:15.820
and also you can hook it up to your TV and actually plug in real Super Nintendo controllers to make

02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:23.580
like a mini console of sorts. And so that's available for purchase as well. And, uh, actually,

02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:29.340
I believe it's on Amazon. Let's see what this thing goes for here. Uh, 80 bucks. That's almost

02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:34.300
cheaper. I think the buying Super Nintendo, but if you want to play, you know, something portable

02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:41.740
without emulating and without actually hacking a console, there you go. That's the way to go about

02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:50.140
it. Um, and then of course, let's see, this sounds all sorts of stupid, but EA has relaunched

02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:58.380
Tetris on the iOS, uh, system or platform if you will, but there is a little issue with it. Um,

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:07.100
it's $30 a year and, um, you can basically, uh, thanks Apple for opening up the subscription

02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:11.660
thing to everybody. Really appreciate that. Cause EA was ready to jump on that, weren't they?

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:17.020
Um, it does have some new features including, uh, galaxy mode and marathon one touch mode,

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:23.820
whatever that means. And also, um, it's been specifically designed for touch screen gameplay.

02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:30.540
And of course, um, you can subscribe to the Teak Club, which offers exclusive access to new mobile

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:40.540
challenges. Um, you can snag a one month membership for $2.99 or you could drop $30 for a full year.

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:48.780
And of course the game costs you money anyways. It's 99 cents. I'll pass. Thank you very much.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:56.060
Ditto. And then of course, uh, last but not least Lego Batman 2, um, it's going to be coming out

02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:01.020
at some point. And what's kind of cool though is actually there's going to be some other

02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:06.300
superheroes involved with it as well. Not just Batman. In fact, there's a little teaser showing,

02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:12.460
um, Superman in there and also Lex Luthor in the background as well as, um, you know,

02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:18.620
some other characters. So, uh, Batman, Lego Batman 2 super DC superheroes will be the new title,

02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:24.780
I believe. And, uh, that'd be kind of neat. And also they're saying that they're expecting

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:32.620
that Green Lantern and Wonder Woman will appear in it as well. Looks cool. It's going to be hard

02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:36.300
to compete with Arkham City though, even when you're Legos. Well, I understand that. And the Lego

02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:44.060
games are pretty fun. Lego Batman wasn't bad. So, um, it'll be cool. All right. Um, another game is

02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:48.780
going free to play. Another MMO has announced that they're going free to play, which usually means

02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:55.020
it just didn't work with the subscription model. Um, EverQuest 2 is now gone for going free to

02:13:55.020 --> 02:14:00.380
play, but here's the weird thing. Okay. EverQuest 2 kind of did a free to play thing already last

02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:06.620
year. It was a browser based game called EverQuest 2 extended, but the rest of the game is now going

02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:12.140
free to play on December 6th. Um, the offerings of, um, ever, excuse me, I'm going to sneeze in

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:17.740
a minute. Bless you. Oh, rude. My body faked me out. Have you ever had that happen? It's like,

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:23.740
I'm going to sneeze. I'm going to sneeze psych. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Great radio. Uh,

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:29.420
EverQuest 2 extended is now going to be folded into the rest of EverQuest 2 and there will be

02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:35.980
free. There will be silver and there will be gold free members get just a little bit silver members,

02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:41.820
which paid $5 or 500, uh, space bucks station point things per month. They get a little more.

02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:46.060
And then if you're gold, you're paying the whole 15 a month. Well, you get everything.

02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:51.260
So there you go. EverQuest 2, you can now check out. I wonder if it'll get the same reception that,

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:57.420
um, uh, DC universe did. I think EverQuest 2 is supposed to have a lot of voice acting and stuff

02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:02.140
in it. You know, EverQuest 2 was an interesting game because a lot of people were really pissed

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:05.260
that you couldn't really interface it with EverQuest 1. So people didn't want to leave

02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:12.060
EverQuest 1, which is still going, still going dark soccer. What do you got for us?

02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:18.860
Well, I have a little something for us, and that is something about a game that people have been

02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:22.620
waiting for, except it's not that actual particular version of the game that people have been waiting

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:30.460
for. It's, um, Kid Icarus, but it's the 3D classics. Kid Icarus is going to be given away for

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:41.340
free when, um, it launches on January 5th. And that's, um, you have to register two eligible

02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:49.500
3DS titles online this Christmas. So that's kind of janky, but all right, whatever. It's a club

02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:54.860
Nintendo thing. So you'd get the free download code for the remastered version when it comes

02:15:54.860 --> 02:16:03.180
out next year. But where's the fun? Ugh. People. All right. But I mean, for the people that are

02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:07.580
getting Mario Land 3D or whatever, and I guess I shouldn't say jank because, you know, free,

02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:13.420
free is free. So, uh, and a lot of people are getting the Mario 3D Land and the Mario Kart 7,

02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:16.780
so it's going to make sense that there'll be a lot of people that are getting this. I totally

02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:23.020
won a 3DS this year, but I would rather go to Alabama. There you go. All right. Well,

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:26.380
believe it or not, that's all the news we had planned to talk about tonight. So we're going

02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:32.140
to actually open up the Skype line. It is open now 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is

02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:35.980
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call. There's a little bit of a delay tonight. So before

02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:40.380
I get to the Twitter and because we've got like two things on Twitter so far, maybe there'll be

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:43.820
a few more in a minute here. We'll see. Before I get to Twitter, do you have anything else you

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:47.260
want to talk about, Loki, with, um, last minute stories before we get to the Twitters? Yeah,

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:52.940
let's talk about, uh, how the Vita will not support simultaneous, uh, web browsing and game

02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:58.300
play. Can only do one or the other at the time. And, uh... Is that really that big of a deal,

02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:01.340
though? Nah, I don't think so. I don't think so either. I mean, I know a lot of people are making

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:03.980
a big deal out of it, but I don't, I don't think it's that big of a deal because, like,

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:10.780
what system now lets you do that? Well, besides a PC, yes, okay, I get that. Hello. But, you know,

02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:17.820
I, I wasn't really expecting that to be something on the Vita anyway, so. Yeah, um, also, of course,

02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:23.580
there's, uh, that story that, you know, the rumor is that the PlayStation Network downloads will be

02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:29.420
discounted 40%. I don't know where that's, it's, apparently you said that a recent Vita event

02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:37.900
is where they announced that. In my pants. I, I don't think so. I don't know. Even if they are,

02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:42.940
that's still too damn much for those random cards. Yeah, and that's great. That, that's promoting

02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:46.780
that you can buy those games digitally, but you know what? I wouldn't do that anyways,

02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:51.180
because, guess what? I get tired of my games after a while, and I wanna sell them used.

02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:58.300
So, meh. What's gonna be awesome is if they figure out a way to erase the game cards and

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:04.620
use them as memory cards. You buy, like, a cheap ass $10 game and it's like, hey,

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:07.980
I'm gonna erase this shit. That's what I think's gonna ultimately happen. I think the hackers are

02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:13.020
gonna find ways to erase the games and make them into memory cards. I, I could see that happening,

02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:19.740
absolutely. Again, our Skype line 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:27.900
Anything else? Um. I like fire. There was another, another, uh, story commenting on the whole FIFA

02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:33.420
fishing thing. Apparently EA has put up some stuff on their website about how to spot fishing sites.

02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:37.020
And they're still insisting that it's not a security breach, but yeah.

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:42.220
Yeah, there's a great story on another site and I freaking forgot the name. I'm so sorry,

02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:46.620
but the guy was writing about how he got hacked. And it's like kind of one of those things was

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:51.580
like, I just, I needed to wait for a mainstream game journalist to get hacked, to finally kind

02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.020
of put it out there where it's like, well, wait a minute. I didn't get fished. And he even says

02:18:55.020 --> 02:19:00.940
this in the story. Like, I don't think I got fished. You know, I'm, I'm not happy this is

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:06.140
happening to people, but I'm kind of glad I'm seeing more about it on other sites. So let me

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.860
go to the phones real quick and then we'll come back to this topic. Remind me to come back to this.

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:12.940
Okay. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, it's the only, one and only Ranma

02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:18.300
Sautome. Hey. Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy? Not much. A couple of things. I just got home,

02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:24.780
so I don't know if you heard about the Angry Birds Cookbook. No, I didn't. The Angry Birds Cookbook.

02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:32.380
Good God. Can this game get any more saturated? It's a cash cow. What can I tell you? Yeah, right.

02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:38.860
So what is in the Angry Birds Cookbook? What will I learn how to cook? Birds? Actually, I don't know.

02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:42.540
I just wonder if you had heard about it because I just stumbled across it, but I didn't have time to

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:51.020
read into it. What's that? I'm sorry. Dark Cyrus phone went off. I said I just saw it online on

02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:56.300
our friend's Facebook, so I didn't get a chance to read the link of what it covered. Maybe it talks

02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.860
about how to cook birds or how to launch birds from your living room into the frying pan.

02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:09.020
Or pig-themed recipes. Seriously, an Angry Birds Cookbook? Like, how? I don't know. Forget it.

02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:15.180
I didn't mean to start you going on a tirade. I think that's Loki's department.

02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:17.980
Ah, Loki's all tiraded out tonight. I don't know if you heard Part A.

02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:25.660
No, I was at a premiere tonight, so. That's alright. Let's just say that Xenoblade news

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:33.580
just kind of one thing led to another on that department. Oh god. I can't wait to listen to

02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:38.140
tonight's episode. Oh, and our website's coming back. That's the big news you missed too. We'll

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:42.540
be back just depending on when DNS updates for people, so hopefully within 24 hours.

02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:48.300
Wonderful. Yep. But, um, the main reason I called is because I actually have a game review.

02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:54.620
A game review? Alright. What do you want to review? Voltron, Defender of the Universe

02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:59.340
for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Wha-wha-wha? Oh, you didn't-

02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:04.940
No. You didn't know? No. Yes, it came out Wednesday. I'm in school. I have no life.

02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:09.180
She's really too busy at Darkmoon Faire and Warcraft. But anyway,

02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:12.940
uh, so tell us a little bit about the Voltron Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:18.860
Long and short of it, you are control of any of the five lions and is up to you to protect

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:25.500
the planet, take out the Robies, and eventually defeat on Lotor. Is it like a tower defense game?

02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:32.060
Actually, no. The controls itself plays like Geometry Wars. Oh, that's kind of cool. I like

02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:39.900
Geometry Wars. Now, take your typical treasure shooter. It's like that. You're pretty much

02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:46.700
running around the plains just blasting everything with the- that you can- that the lasers can see.

02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:50.540
Well, this certainly sounds like a game that's right up Dark Sakura's alley.

02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:57.340
It's a cave shooter or treasure shooter mixed with- Want. Want. You should go download the demo

02:21:57.340 --> 02:22:03.420
on Xbox. I think I will. Uh, Uchon, one more thing. Yes. If you like- if you like it,

02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:07.900
depending on which system you want it for, I will gift it for you as an early Christmas gift.

02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:14.540
Aww, what a nice boy. Aww, okay. That's the best part about doing this show. Once in a while,

02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:22.380
free shit. Heck yeah. Thank you. Love you, Rama. Love you, Mina. So on a scale of, um,

02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:28.140
one to five Voltrons, five being super awesome and one being not so awesome, what is your score?

02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:33.820
Seven. That's a pretty good review. So you're saying it gets a Green Ranger? Hell yeah.

02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:37.500
Now, what do you say to Jim Sally who says in our chat room, Voltron is for babies?

02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:45.820
Your butt's for babies. As the saying goes, haters are gonna hate. Hey, Rama, do you know what I

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:53.500
actually just watched all of last week? What? Go Lion. I have all of it and I watched all of it.

02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:58.220
By the way, one of the achievements for Saints Bro is called Hate is Gonna Hate.

02:22:58.220 --> 02:23:01.580
I heard about that. I saw somebody get that on Twitter. And, and Rama,

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:08.140
this is such a great story. You're going to hate it, but I don't care. Okay. So I thought

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:14.620
of you this week. Yeah. Okay. I was watching Wendy Williams. That's a man. I just want you to know

02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:22.380
that's a man. Okay. But you know, I love Wendy Williams. Okay. How you doing? And she was talking

02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.860
about, I don't know, getting a letter from Oprah or something. And at the end of it, she said,

02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:33.260
and I kid you not, she said, stay black. And I'm like, does Wendy Williams listen to this show?

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:39.580
Cause I thought that joke started here. Uh, wait, wait, wait, Rob, stop. You said you like

02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:44.940
Wendy Williams? Haters gonna hate. 50 points from Gryffindor.

02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:51.580
All right. Look, I'm trying, I'm trying to share this story about how I think of

02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:55.980
listeners throughout the week when things happen that remind me of them. In this case,

02:23:55.980 --> 02:24:00.620
somebody say stay black. Cause that all started with you here on the show, you know.

02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:07.740
It didn't actually, it's not just, uh, related to, it's, it's a phrase that's been out for a

02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:12.860
long time. I know that, but I'm just saying, I heard it in mainstream press this week and it

02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:19.020
made me think of our Rama. Stay black. Dan didn't bring me any high, I'm mad at him.

02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:23.260
All right, Rama, we're gonna let you go to get more calls, but, um, go back to Voltron,

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:28.620
have fun. Will do. And of course, stay black. And you stay fabulous. I will. Oh, I will girl.

02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:35.740
All right. Bye. One eight seven seven game O L R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:40.700
Cause you don't chat. So stay black is an old saying. I know that. Gosh, I'm just being silly.

02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:48.140
All right. Orange lounge radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. O L R.

02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:50.940
How about some tweets in the meantime?

02:24:54.460 --> 02:25:00.540
O L R fan forever. Hey, I like that name. That's a great Twitter name. O L R fan forever. And it's,

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:05.740
it's, it's like, it's not my mom or something. Like it's an actual person. O L R fan forever

02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:11.660
asks on the Twitter, what happened to the tester? Was dark Sakura eliminated?

02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:17.660
Actually, I believe dark Sakura, after much soul searching, pulls herself out of contention.

02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:24.140
Correct? I just didn't bother promoting it. You just kind of after, I mean, that night it was

02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:28.940
funny, but then the next day it was like, would I really want to uproot my life for that? And

02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:35.660
it was like, on the plus side, I'd be closer to Disneyland on the negative side. I would be

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:43.820
whoring myself out to Sony. I am no one's whore. Let's go to the phones higher on orange launch

02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:55.500
radio. Who's this solid train pulling up to the station. By the way, can I just say though the,

02:25:55.500 --> 02:26:01.420
I'm assuming this is your kid on the user pic. Adorable. Isn't she fresh and clean.

02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:07.900
Absolutely adorable. Look at her little hoodie on it. I know it's precious. I love it. All right.

02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:11.660
Sorry to derail. Try sorry to derail the Jim Sally train, but it had to be said,

02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:16.620
what's on your mind, buddy? Jim Sally train's coming in today. We got to have some discussions

02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:23.340
people. Okay. First off, we need to talk about evil G again, getting a bad rep for publishers

02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:30.540
issues with these game cards expiring. It's not, we really shouldn't be mad at EA for having their

02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:35.980
game cards expire. It's evil G's fault. You know, if I went to the grocery store to buy some milk

02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:40.140
and the milk was expired, I wouldn't yell at the farmer. I'd yell at the store that sold me

02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:44.780
the expired milk. I think EB games should be taking these games off their shelves. Shouldn't

02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:50.220
be EA's fault. You know, that's an interesting kind of perspective on it. I have to admit,

02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:55.420
I didn't really think about it like that. I mean, I don't know. I kind of, I get what you're saying.

02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:59.020
I still kind of want to fault EA at the end of the day because I'm kind of like, I feel like they

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:02.620
didn't really think about this. I don't think they informed the stores either. They have this problem.

02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.380
And I kind of think the stores don't know either. I think people just told evil G,

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:10.860
the evil, you know, evil G is they would just pretend like they didn't know sell it to you

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:15.740
anyway. I don't care, but they're so they're all in cahoots. I don't think they're in cahoots. I

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:21.420
think evil G is just doing it anyway. Like EA probably told evil G, yo, give us those games

02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:25.900
back if you don't sell them. Evil G is like, whatever, we can sell anything. I would honestly

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:30.300
think though that evil G wouldn't have as hard of a time keeping those games on shelves as maybe

02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:36.060
like an independent Ma and Pa shop who, you know, only rarely gets a lot of people to come through

02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:40.620
there buying games that is more likely to have the product sitting on a shelf for a long time.

02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:44.460
Because the Ma and Pa retailer is losing out to places like evil G. They're getting these

02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:49.020
exclusives and so forth. I would think they're more likely to have the stale product on their

02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:54.140
shelf. And I would just feel bad applying that logic to the Ma and Pa retailer who kind of can't

02:27:54.140 --> 02:28:01.180
control that no one wants the goddamn game. I don't know. Well, either way, in EA's fault,

02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:04.540
how long are you supposed to keep these codes active for? And it's a service. There's no

02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:09.740
monetary value to it. Right? It's a service. It's not like a gift card. A gift card is an

02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:15.580
account receivable which can be measured in exact terms of currency. I realize the gift

02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:21.980
card thing is a stretch. It is a service being provided later. It is a little bit like you can't,

02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:25.660
it's not apples to apples comparison. But my point with that was that it's still,

02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:34.300
it would be $10 to replace that pass. So, you know, it kind of does have a value that suddenly

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:44.860
you're losing. Plus, also think about this, even though we're talking about games that have

02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:50.700
dropped in price after a year, not all games always drop in price even after a year. And

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:54.380
here's the other thing too. Look at Blizzard games. If they're saying that, oh, by the way,

02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:59.340
you know, this incentive that we really gave you to buy new, it expires January 1st. Okay,

02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:04.220
well then I'm gonna buy used. Why would I buy it brand new then if you're giving me no incentive

02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:08.700
to do so? That's not the way to do it. Really? It's not the way to do it? We shouldn't punish

02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:14.860
the publishers for doing this type of bullshit? Yeah. How are we supposed to keep the stuff open

02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:19.980
for it? I don't even think it's a punishment thing. It's just a, any shoppers gonna find the

02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:27.980
best value they can. Yeah, man. It's up to you. When you go buy a Toyota, you just roll up to the

02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:33.100
dealership down the street, you shop around a little bit before you buy it. You have to

02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:36.780
educate yourself a little bit before you buy it. Yeah, and play the game with people. Everyone's

02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:42.460
got a different deal. But I thought the whole point was to entice people to buy new because

02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:48.380
they're throwing these little gifts in and stuff like that. If there's nothing there that, you

02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:52.620
know, there's no difference other than, okay, someone's played this game, you know, and someone

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:59.260
hasn't played this copy of the game, then if, unless that's a big deal to me to buy brand new,

02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:03.420
I'll probably opt to buy it used and probably could get it for really cheap. Now going back to

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:09.260
the whole GameStop selling expired milk analogy, does it really matter to EA anymore because they

02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:13.420
know GameStop is not going to restock the game this far after the day? EA has already made their

02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:16.860
money by putting that game on GameStop's shelf. They don't care at this point if the game is sold

02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:20.140
new or used because they already sold the game. They're probably not buying new copies of that

02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:23.820
game anyways because they probably have like a ton of them sitting on their shelf used anyways.

02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:29.340
And always when you're buying stuff brand new from there, you know, hey, you know, say I want to buy

02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:32.460
a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that. Hey, by the way, we've got a bunch of copies

02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:37.420
that are used, you know, that are in good, you know, good quality that you can get for, you know,

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:41.980
five, ten dollars cheaper or whatever. And most people will be like, okay, sure, I'll do that.

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:46.460
Unless they're giving it for a gift or something like that. But, you know, you can probably guess

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:54.780
that, and I'm guessing here that they're probably, this is probably just applying to the original run

02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:58.620
of Mass Effect 2. Let's say they come out with a Game of the Year edition, or, well, not Game of

02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:01.980
the Year edition, but like a Platinum Hits version or something like that, which I think they have.

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:05.740
That might actually have a different expiration date on it because it came out a little bit later.

02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:12.780
I mean, I don't know. I haven't really looked at it, but they may have. All right. Well, Jim Sally,

02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:16.060
I gotta wrap up so we can try and squeeze in one more call and a few more tweets. Do you have any

02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:20.140
any final words on the subject or any other subject for that matter? South Park Game is

02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:23.340
going to be a great game of Obsidian. They're the best developers ever in the world of Obsidian.

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:28.380
Thank you for Obsidian for making such beautiful games as Fallout 3 and Vegas and Knights of the

02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:34.860
Republic 2. I love you everybody, and don't forget, if you're picking your nose and it starts to bleed,

02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:42.540
you're picking it too much or not enough. Thank you for that sage advice, Jim Sally.

02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:47.580
Appreciate it. I have high hopes for the South Park Game too, I will say, so I hope they don't

02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:52.540
let me down. Back to the Twitters. 1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio. We can

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:56.540
probably squeeze in like one more call. Dark Tetsuya tweeted us and said, hey,

02:31:56.540 --> 02:32:01.740
OLR, just a shout out to Loki for recommending Ready Player One. I don't think I've ever loved

02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:05.180
a book this much. P.S. Fuck the Sixers. I'm assuming that's something from the book.

02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:10.860
Tigerclaw sends us a few stories that slip through the cracks otherwise.

02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:16.220
Some layoffs at Day One Studios because they lost a Konami publishing deal.

02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:22.300
Tigerclaw links us to an article on Gamasutra via the Twitter saying that Day One Studios,

02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:29.660
who developed F.E.A.R. 3 and Mech Assault, they laid off 95%. That's an entire development team

02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:35.660
because they lost a publishing deal with Konami. Apparently, they were working on a reboot of

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:43.660
Silent Scope. Interesting, but I guess Konami must have seen it and said, this stinks, and they

02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:51.260
pulled it. Yeah, Silent Scope is kind of neat, but then I can also kind of go, maybe with all

02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:55.820
the Kinect and Move technology, it was a weird thing to pull off. Maybe. Well, they didn't have

02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:59.980
to do it that way. I mean, they have some popular sniper series out there now. They have Sniper

02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:08.220
Elite and then they also had Sniper Ghost Warrior, something like that, that was actually pretty well

02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:13.740
liked and they have sequels coming out. I mean, there's not a lot of sniper games, but I think

02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:18.780
something like Silent Scope would have stood out. I would have guessed that they were working on,

02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:22.940
was it that, I don't remember the fuck the series is called now, the one that was on the PSP and

02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:26.860
then they were supposed to be doing one for the PS3. It was like a sci-fi shooter or something

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:32.860
like that. I don't remember. That's how wonderful that game was. But there was, it was supposed to

02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:37.340
be like a launch title for the PS3, but I guess I would have been a little late. All right, let me

02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:41.900
go to the phones. We got one more call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is

02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:48.300
Kokomo. I just have a question. When Mass Effect 3 comes out, are you going to play Mass Effect 1,

02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:55.020
2, and 3? That's a lot of Mass Effect. I got to admit, okay, Mass Effect is not a series that I

02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:00.780
really got into as much as I probably should based on what everybody's telling me. But here's the

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:05.020
thing. What I really like about what they're doing in Mass Effect 3 is the whole idea. I mean,

02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:08.700
I guess this is from that demo that leaked out before and all that. Remember how they had the

02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:14.620
demo up early? Is that they have a mode that focuses more on RPG and storytelling and a mode

02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:19.180
that focuses more on the battle. It's kind of like you can almost like shift the game to whatever end

02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:23.980
of the game you like more. And the RPG mode to me sounds really, really interesting because I do

02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:28.540
think BioWare can tell some good stories. But as far as like, do I have enough time to freaking

02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:35.740
play Mass Effect 1 and 2? Probably not. But if Mass Effect 2, or if they do with 3, what they

02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:40.700
do with 2, didn't Mass Effect 2 like have a mode where like they explain the story of Mass Effect

02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:47.580
1 in like a comic book form or something that was in the game? Sort of, yeah. On the PS3, they did.

02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:51.980
So maybe there'll be something like that. So at least the rest of us can get caught up.

02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:54.860
What's your opinion on it? Are you a Mass Effect fan?

02:34:56.140 --> 02:35:00.300
I really do enjoy Mass Effect. I mean, I'm probably going to have to take like a whole

02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:07.900
like week off of work just to play 1, 2, and 3. I mean, then you have like all the different

02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:13.500
things like you can be evil. And then that's another play around. It's just so much time.

02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:19.660
This is the way of BioWare though. Like right now, Alan has been playing a lot of Dragon Age.

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:24.220
Like he just randomly like this month decided to start playing this game from 2009, but I've

02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:28.780
watched him play through it once. It's kind of like a goody two shoes. Once it's a villain,

02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:32.540
now he's working on the expansion. It's kind of like he got two completely different types of

02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:36.780
games based on how he was playing the story. And this is one thing that BioWare is like really

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:41.740
good at. And it's kind of why a lot of people are really excited about The Old Republic because

02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:47.740
Lover hates Star Wars. They're bringing a lot of that Mass Effect style storytelling in Dragon Age

02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:54.220
into an MMO. And for some people, that's very, very exciting. Absolutely. All right. That's all

02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:58.620
my questions. You guys have a great night. That's all right. Thank you for your station. All right.

02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:02.780
Well, thank you so much. Have a great night and try not to lose too much sleep when the game

02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:08.140
comes out. Okay. I won't. All right. Later. I know a lot of people are very excited about

02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:12.540
Mass Effect 3. You know, it's just one of those series where it's like, if there were more hours

02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:17.900
in the day, I probably would have gotten into Mass Effect, but I just, you can't play everything,

02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:25.340
especially when you have a day job. All right. TigerCloth also tweets us one more link here.

02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:30.940
And that is that the Electronic Frontier Foundation wants console modding and jailbreaking

02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:39.820
deemed legal by the DMCA, linking us to a story at 1UP.com, where apparently the Digital Millennium

02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:46.860
Copyright Act, the DMCA, a few exemptions were granted about a year ago, which had to do with

02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:52.620
the jailbreaking the cell phones that was told seemed to be fair use. Now the EFF is saying,

02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:56.620
shouldn't that whole logic apply to video game consoles as well? If you want to mod your video

02:36:56.620 --> 02:37:01.660
game consoles, what do you think? I think that's an interesting way of having the logic is that if

02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:05.740
you can jailbreak your phone, why can't you jailbreak your video game console? Loki, I'm

02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:10.940
sure you're all for this. Well, just because it's legal to do that doesn't mean that it's

02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:15.500
necessarily going to be any different than it is now, because basically they'll still ban your

02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:21.340
console or whatever if you try to go online. All it means is that you can't have anything like,

02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:26.300
you know, Sony coming after Geohot or something like that. They won't have that. And I was going

02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:34.220
to say, is it really illegal to do that right now? Technically, I mean, sort of it is. I mean,

02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:38.540
but they're just not going to come after the user, especially now that they have, in fact,

02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:45.260
ironically enough, I'm looking at some right now about reset glitch hacking on. Well, you can do

02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:51.900
it on any Xbox 360, regardless of the dashboard, at least as of right now. And looking at slim

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:57.980
body and stuff like that. Just curious to see what's required for that stuff. Interesting.

02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:03.500
You know, I don't think modding your Wii or PS3 or anything is the problem. It's that they don't

02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:10.460
want you playing pirated games on it for one and, you know, using exploits and all that stuff as

02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:14.140
well. So that's why, you know, usually these companies will kick you off the network if they,

02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:17.900
which they can do because it's their network. Exactly. But, you know, like for instance,

02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:21.100
didn't the government buy a bunch of PlayStation threes because they were super computers?

02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:26.700
They probably never upgraded them or, you know, who knows, maybe they even found a work around

02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:29.740
so they didn't have to upgrade them because there's plenty of ways to do it on the internet.

02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:33.500
I don't think those things even, I don't think those ever hit the PlayStation network. They're

02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:41.340
just using Linux, so it wouldn't matter. All right. Well, that's going to do it for the

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:45.100
Twitter topics tonight. And that's also going to do it for the Skype line. Big apologies to those

02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:48.940
didn't get through tonight, but we will have the mailbag up midweek, or you can always send us

02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:54.060
tweets as well, or leave us a message on Facebook or Google+. We'll take your comments there too.

02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:58.780
We can read some of those on the show, but for now, that's it. We're wrapping up. We're getting

02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:01.740
out of here. You were done with last minute stories, right? Loki, do we finish everything?

02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:07.020
Okay. Um, I didn't have anything. I figured because you would have spoke up if you did.

02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:12.700
Hey. Hey. So anyway, that's going to do it for another Orange Lounge Radio. Um,

02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:17.340
it's almost nine o'clock or midnight on the East coast. So I think it's about time to wrap up.

02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:21.100
Um, first off, thank you guys so much for listening to our show. Thank you for downloading

02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:25.260
and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. You know, it's been kind of a poopy past couple of weeks

02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:29.740
with all the bumps in the website and everything, but you guys still stick by us. Those of you that

02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:32.300
are listening live are still showing up and listening live. We have a lot of people in

02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:36.140
chat tonight. So thank you guys so much. And podcast ease, you've stuck by us and here you

02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:40.140
are downloading another show. So I just, I really appreciate it. Thanks for the support. Um,

02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:43.740
remember if you like Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, we don't ask for your money,

02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:46.380
although I will ask for your money Thursday night for a good cause.

02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:51.900
That will be an exception. Uh, but you know, here on this program, we don't ask for your money. All

02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:58.540
we ask help spread the word, tell somebody about the program and, uh, you know, help the OL army

02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:03.180
grow. So on that note, let's go around and get her base final thoughts so we can get out of here

02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:07.180
tonight. Loki, I'll start with you. Your final thought tonight. Uh, my final thought is I'm

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:13.980
picking a really weird song for cage match. Awesome. Um, my final thought is now, now that

02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.700
Loki's lamey borrow saints road, the third, am I able to, without the online pass, download the

02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:25.180
character that, um, uh, Travis Donovan pass is only for playing co-op or co-op or system link.

02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:29.820
Um, all right. I'm going to have to figure out how to do that. I want Travis Donovan's little, um,

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:35.340
you need it. Okay. Well you need to create a profile on the saints row website. Once you do

02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:41.500
that, you go browse to his character and you click it to you add it to as like a book market

02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:45.500
or something like that. And you go into your game and you log in with your account from the saints

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:51.740
row website and then you can download it. I can do that. Yes. Awesome. All right. And a dark soccer,

02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:56.380
your final thought. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the difference of one day

02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:02.540
makes a hundred dollar price difference in plane to plane fare. Yes. And that was from a Tuesday

02:41:02.540 --> 02:41:06.940
to a Wednesday. Oh, I was going to say Thursday to Friday or something on the weekend I get,

02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:13.420
but that's boy, airline fees are interesting. That's uh, yeah, exactly a hundred dollars.

02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:18.380
Wow. All right. Well thank you guys, uh, again for tuning in and downloading the show and one

02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:24.380
more time. Awesome event happening this Thursday, December 8th, six 30 Pacific nine 30 Eastern

02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:29.020
um, loud.org. I'll be there live. Dark soccer will be there in house. If you're in the San

02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:33.580
Francisco Bay area, you better be at the DNA lounge. Bring 10 bucks, bring a little more

02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:38.300
to donate for some raffle tickets and stuff to a great cause. Um, loud. We're going to rock out.

02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:42.380
So I'll see you on Thursday and then we'll see you again back here Sunday night for another

02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:47.660
