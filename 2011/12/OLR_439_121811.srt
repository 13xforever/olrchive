Tonight, December 18th, 2011, Square Enix experiences a hack, Nintendo offers free games

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,920
for loyalty points, and the PlayStation Vita appears to abandon the instruction manual.

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,860
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,960
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with the 439th episode

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:50,080
of our show on this December the 18th of 2011. We're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,520
where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,200
after the Bobby Blackall show. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,940
next few hours to talk about video games, gamer culture, gamer lifestyle, and so forth

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,920
with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. You're like that video of Rick

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Perry where they replaced him with a butt. That one was great. How are you? I'm okay.

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,160
Yeah? It's been a long day. It's been a long day. Been packing up stuff. Mm-hmm. Been...

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,640
big changes coming. Preparing to abandon ship. Yeah, there's some big changes coming. We're

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,760
saying goodbye tonight, so we'll come back to that in a minute. Yeah. So let's also go

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,640
to the one and only Techmaster, Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? Fine. I see you brought

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,240
your 3DS tonight. Yes, I did. And I brought my 3DS. You know what that means? Mario Kart

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,200
Break Time! Hell yes! So live listeners, get your 3DSs because we're going to try and do

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,160
at least one track, if not two, of Mario Kart during the break tonight, so be ready for

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,440
it. The official OLRME 3DS code. It's on Twitter. It's on our forums too over at orangelawnsradio.com,

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,680
and I'm sure it will be pasted in chat momentarily. Tiger Claw will have it pasted there in three

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,640
seconds. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to join our chat room, of course, and

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,440
talk with us there. All right. In fact, Jim Salley is in our chat room tonight starting

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,440
us off talking about the intro to the show, saying, Jim Salley, OLR's intro is great.

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,120
It always pumps me up. It is a great little song. That was by Midihead. If you don't know

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,600
who did our intro, his name is Midihead. He did some of the songs in DDR, Beatmania, kind

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,280
of like around when the Xbox version, original Xbox versions were big. He's a great guy.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,240
We had him on the show. And then Jim Salley says, then Rob's soothing voice brings me

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,680
down and I get all snuggly in bed. Not sure how to take that, but all right, sure. Whatever

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,480
floats your boat. Whatever gets you to listen live with us. Anyhow, so usually we start

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,880
off the show with how is your gaming week, so I think we'll get into that and then we'll

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,280
come back to the housekeeping thing we want to talk about. So let's talk about our gaming

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,040
weeks. DarkSakura, how was your gaming week? I played shit. I really haven't done a whole

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,040
bunch of console stuff just because we've been packing up stuff. More coming later.

33
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,820
We do have the GameCube out so that we could play the Game Boy Advance player. So we had

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:22,360
some run-throughs of the Final Fight that's on there and I played some P.O.P.O. and I

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,720
think Dan played some Metroid Fusion. But I mean we were just bopping through a few

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
games here and there. It's like Game Boy Advance made a comeback this week between that and

37
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,600
the 3DS news, which I know is coming up later, but everybody knows those games came out.

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,960
So we actually put the Saturn up because we're tired of Christmas nights. Oh well. Christmas

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:51,320
is cancelled. Da da da, da da da, I don't care to play this anymore. No other holiday

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,960
games to get you in the mood? Um, no. You don't want to dance to Silent Hill in D.R.?

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Wow. Wow? Winter Veil? I've been doing stupid Winter Veil shit. No, finally, thank you Shane

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,240
for making me an orc DK so I can throw snowflakes at you. I don't even know if he's listening.

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,120
If you're listening. If you're not. There's Rick Perry again. He made a drawn-eye priest

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,560
for me to throw snowflakes at named poor Jamie. I think when I, and just so people know, like

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,280
what this is, there's certain achievements in WoW where you have to find characters of

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,800
a certain, like around the holidays, like for instance the Easter one or whatever they

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,440
call Easter in WoW, I can't remember. Noble Garden. Noble Garden, that's it. You have

48
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,780
to find female characters of each race level eighteen or over and it's called Shake Your

49
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,560
Bunny Maker. And you have to turn them into bunnies. And they have to be level eighteen

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,400
or older. I can tell you this because I'm a female dwarf which is like a freaking unicorn

51
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,920
in WoW and I can't tell you how much I get turned into a freaking bunny when that holiday

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,720
comes around. Freaking goats are easy to find. So I made a rogue for whatever the last holiday

53
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,920
was. You had to do something with a blood elf rogue. I don't remember why I did it,

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,360
but I did. And I named it Oops I Pooped. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that one. You made it for

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,200
me to find. Cause I still haven't deleted it. I thought you had a troll. I did, but

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,280
I deleted the troll so I could make the rogue. No, that's right. Cause I had to go, I had

57
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,280
to go run to you. Yeah. Stupid silver moon. Um, but yeah, so I've actually been playing

58
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Peggle in WoW too now that it works again. Nice. But right now the thing that I'm trying

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,640
to get is I have to kill ten more people while dressed as a gnome in a, uh, Santa costume.

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh yeah. I don't like how it kind of forces you to do PVP if you want to get all the achievements.

61
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
I know. And then like you get killed and you don't and you lose the disguise. All I have

62
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,960
to say when that stupid kids holiday comes up, you are going to want to kill, kill something.

63
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean it's just, I actually, I want to do BB King. That's, that's not too bad. BB King

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,440
is where you go to, to the major hoard cities and you have to shoot the leaders with a BB

65
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,880
gun. Like, like I'm going to go shoot Sylvanus in the ass or something. Anyway, I saved the

66
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,920
WoW talk for the other show. Hoardhouse.com. Well have me back on. We might. Episode 50

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,000
is coming up very soon. When? I just have to convince Extrofer we should tape more often

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
than every other week. But that's another, that's another story. Well, um, I also got

69
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,880
some games on steam cause I got the humble indie bundle thanks to Rob and I started cave

70
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,080
story and then Dan's like, I was like, I'm kind of tired of playing cause we've had a

71
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,400
busy day. Dance like, Oh, play more. So he's watching me play cave story. That doesn't

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,980
usually happen. Usually you're watching him play stuff. So he's like, he gave, okay, check

73
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,980
out this elder thing. Rob. Nice. My old school game pad controller. You should put a picture

74
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,320
of that on olr.com. I might. It's actually not the one. It's not the one that I used

75
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,800
when I played. What brand is that? Is that like a gravis gravis? It's not the one that

76
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,360
I used when I played a final fantasy 11 in my, the older one that kind of to me looks

77
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,680
like what the PlayStation three controller was going to look like. Like it kind of has

78
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,200
that boomerang thing going on a little bit, just a little bit, but it's not quite as tacky

79
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,480
as that other controller was. It's actually fairly comfortable. I mean, cause you know,

80
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,640
my hands all fucked up. Yeah. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm kind of high. The pro you

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:28,640
are, I had had half a beer and I've been allergies all day. So cause all the dust we've kicked

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,880
up. So yeah. Um, I played cave story and then I got another game just randomly. I happened

83
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,280
to see it up on steam and I was like, that was kind of pretty. I'm going to get it cause

84
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,200
it's pretty. It was a game called fractal that you have to, um, you have these little

85
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:55,080
hexagon shapes on and for those who don't know their roots, hexagons are six sided polyhedrons.

86
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,920
What's a polyhedron? Your butt. Um, so you have to form, attach something of the same

87
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,440
color to all sides of it and then it'll explode. But you have a push. So say you have to push

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,640
in the spaces around them and you get a certain color that you'll push with and like say that

89
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,080
you're only on one side. We only push in one side, but say that you push in the dead center

90
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,880
of a circle of them, it'll push them all out all in that color. So you have to make the

91
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,440
little all six sides of one touch and sometimes you can get multiple, they're called blooms

92
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,000
and you see you get point multipliers and you also get little ones that if you hit them,

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,380
they destroy everything around them and all this stuff. But it's really hard. Like I'm

94
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:45,880
only on the 10th stage and there's a bunch of them and you have to get like 320 breaks

95
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,800
done and like the most I can get is 240. It's tough. But you were telling me the music kind

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,800
of adds to the game, right? The music is very trancey. It's very ambient trance. And, um,

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,620
as you do better, as your score goes up in that level, it's like, like for example, when

98
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,280
you break one blossom, that's seven points. If you get like a double, you get 14 awesome

99
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:18,800
blossom. If you get anyway, um, what was I saying? Oh yeah. So you get the, as you get

100
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,320
more points, the music gets more complex. But when you run out of pushes, like when

101
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,580
you get down to like five pushes, the music starts going really slow and it doesn't change

102
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:38,840
in pitch. It just changes in tempo. So it's just like, you know, really slow. And then

103
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,200
you're on your last push and then it just stops. And one thing that I really like about

104
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,760
is actually the type design in this game. It's really pretty. Of course. Well, it like

105
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,540
your, your levels come out on a diagonal. Um, your, when it gives you all your level

106
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,560
information and your scores, like I'll try to go in and do a screen cap of a level so

107
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,680
that I can show people what it looks like, but it's really gorgeous game. And like when

108
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,200
you choose your graphics settings, you have like good, bad, but when you start going better,

109
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,520
you have beautiful, you know, so it's pretty cool. And it starts off asking if you want

110
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,200
to play it windowed. Cause you look pretty from the two seconds I saw you playing it.

111
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,560
Yeah. Um, I'll uh, I'll put some screen caps. It's like it's six bucks right now on steam.

112
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,520
So go, go get it. All of you go get it so that they'll make more and maybe they'll make

113
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,240
a tutorial so that it's not so freaking hard. It's one of those games that's so hard that

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
it pisses you off until you have to beat it. I'm so mad. I will conquer you. All right.

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,800
You, you whore going on to a Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, it was okay. I played

116
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:04,640
a lot of Skyrim. Um, been exploiting the Dawn star, uh, hidden Khajiit treasure chest. Um,

117
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
actually did that for quite a bit last night. It's very rewarding because you get a lot

118
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,600
of loot and money and you get to kill somebody in their face over and over and over again.

119
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,960
So I like that phrase, kill someone in their face. Yep. You win the award of choice of

120
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,120
words today. Um, and then, uh, so I spent last night trying to take all the loot that

121
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:39,760
I got from Dawn star back to, um, uh, winter hold and what else did I do? Oh yeah. And

122
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,240
then, um, a little bit more in the quest of, uh, a night to remember, which is funny because

123
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,540
it's like a, this big long chain of random things that you did while you were drunk one

124
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,320
night cause you blacked out and can't remember. So it was kind of fun. And then I got a Mario

125
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,460
kart seven and Mario or super Mario three D land for the three DS this week. So I played

126
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,280
lots of Mario kart seven. I finished all the tracks, um, where all the circuits, I guess,

127
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:16,200
in a 50 CC and I started to play some one 50 CC stuff, but man, I mean, seriously, Nintendo,

128
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,960
I understand you got to ramp up the difficulty for one 50 CC, but the rubber band AI is just

129
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,320
so retarded. It's just ridiculous. The amount of it's like, do I really need to be hit with

130
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,000
like two blue shells, five red shells and you know, lightning all at the same time.

131
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, and thank you for doing lightning right as I'm jumping over a cliff. It's like I'm

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,040
playing with fucking assholes in, you know, Mario kart seven. I mean, it's just the computer's

133
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,920
like, ha, suck it bitch. You're over it. You're in the worst spot possible for a lightning

134
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
bolt and lightning bolt. That's what you're going to get. It's like, I hate that too.

135
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,680
They just, they always seem to know right when you're going over like a big jump and

136
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,960
that's when they're going to hit the lightning bolt or right before you get there. It's just,

137
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,680
that's irritating. You know, it's like, I can be way ahead of everybody else. And you

138
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,800
know, here comes Mario. It's like, Oh, I'm sorry. Mario got like five, uh, five superstars

139
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,160
in a infinite boost all at the same time. Oh, and he's a dragon. It flies now for some

140
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,920
reason. Um, but yeah, it's, it's a fun game. It's Mario Kart. I mean, we expect, um, I

141
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,880
did like some of their choices though for the retro courses. Although I got to say this,

142
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,080
um, my least favorite course in that game has to be probably the, uh, Neo Bowser city.

143
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,480
It's just such a waste. I mean, it could have been cool, but it's just like, you know, I

144
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,520
don't know. It's such a waste of course. I like this black Wolf in our chat room. Of

145
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,540
course the, the man Bobby black Wolf who comes on before us here at all games radio, uh,

146
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,400
says Mario Kart is the original asshole Mario. You ever seen that mod for super Mario world

147
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,840
asshole Mario? That's, that's a very good comparison. I don't remember like the AI being

148
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,480
that bad and like the original game and stuff. I mean, what for the CC was pretty hard, pretty

149
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,200
bad in the original game. It was pretty, maybe the rubber banding was infuriating. Like that's

150
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,440
just all they would do. It wasn't so much the shell cause there was no blue shell in

151
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
the original Mario. I fucking hate the blue shell. I seriously think it's the worst thing

152
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,880
ever. It's just like, it's the, the lightning. It's like the participation award of Mario

153
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,200
Kart. It's like, I suck. I need a show that kills first place. The honorable mention.

154
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,520
That's the ribbon. But no, no, the lightning bolt was supposed to be your, that was in

155
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,680
the original Mario Kart and the lightning bolt was supposed to be the like, fuck everybody

156
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,080
up thing, you know? And that was like the, I am in control. I'm powerful, you know, pass

157
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,320
everybody. Blue shell too much. And I don't like it. All the items aren't, I mean, it

158
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,280
gives you better items obviously in the further back that you are. Fuck that. It should be

159
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,080
even all around. Why shouldn't I be getting green shells and banana peels for being in

160
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,800
first place? I will say though, online I got one of those seven power ups that gives you

161
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,320
just seven fricking items and bam, bam, bam, just firing them all. That was pretty awesome

162
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,880
and I, I made up a lot of space with that one and I know people didn't like me. But

163
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,080
here's the thing. I think that power up sucks. I think in most of it's useless. It's just

164
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,520
like whatever. Are you kidding? I fucked some people up with that. It was awesome. All right.

165
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,840
So there, yeah, Mario Kart. It's pretty awesome. Looking forward to playing it online. Um,

166
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,960
what else? Oh, Super Mario 3 Land. I can't really say too much about it cause I really

167
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,360
didn't get a chance to play it much cause I've been playing mostly Mario Kart. I did

168
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,840
try a little bit of it and I got through maybe a quarter of the first stage in the, you know,

169
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,080
the very first level and then I had to quit. So, I mean, it looks pretty and it plays like

170
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,360
a Mario game. Um, I don't know. That's really all I can say right now. It kind of reminds

171
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,480
me a lot of, you know, Mario 64 I guess. Um, but in the, the setup's kind of a little bit

172
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,400
like Mario Galaxy. But, I mean, that's it. I mean, I'm looking forward to playing more

173
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:02,960
of it. Although, I'm looking forward to playing more Mario Kart than I am Mario 3 Land. Um,

174
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,720
and then, uh, what else did I play? Oh, I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 3

175
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:16,280
the 10th anniversary edition on my iPod. And it looks nice. But damn, I really wish there

176
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,320
was like Bluetooth support for some sort of controller because it sucks trying to control

177
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
that on the... I knew the touchpad was gonna be terrible for that. Well, I mean, it's,

178
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,160
it's, it's good for touch controls, I guess. I mean, but, I mean, there's not a lot you

179
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,840
can really do with touch controls on a game like that. I mean, they have it set up, it

180
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,280
may make sense, but it's just, touch controls suck all the time for a game like that. I

181
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,280
mean, I even tried playing like some of the Gangstar stuff, um, before and it's just,

182
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,240
it doesn't work. But, it looks nice. I just hope that someday Apple will, you know, wise

183
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,360
up and actually have, you know, some sort of controller that would work with some of

184
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
these games. I know that some third party companies have done that, but obviously most

185
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,080
of the games don't support that. Yeah, that thing for the iPad's pretty awesome. The little

186
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,560
arcade machine that you can put it in. Well, that's not so bad. A coworker of mine had

187
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,240
this awesome, like, keyboard looking thing that the iPad kind of plugged into the top

188
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,720
of the flat keyboard and it made it look like a laptop that you could touch the screen on.

189
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,480
It was, it was nice. Hmm. I mean, so, it would be kind of neat if they did something like

190
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,240
that because, damn, I mean, it really sucks that some of these games, just the touch controls

191
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,240
are not good. Alright, anything else? Uh, words of friends, because my wife wants me

192
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,320
the player, and so I'm playing a little bit of that. Uh, and please, you know, I've been

193
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,120
getting invites to SimSocial, I am not fucking playing the SimSocial, so you can just save

194
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,400
yourself some time. I deleted it and blocked it. Do not send me any more invites for that

195
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,920
game. Yep. I'm over it too. Alright, um, quickly, getting into my gaming week, um, not a whole

196
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,960
lot. Call of duty. Shush, you're done. Not a whole lot of new stuff in my week. Uh, still

197
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,840
more wow, still more Saints Row the Third, which is, uh, fun. I, I'm loving all the little

198
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,960
activities in that game, it is so over the top. I never thought I would enjoy this game

199
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,640
as much as I do, but Loki, I hate to say it, you were right, you were so right, this game

200
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,760
is great. I love it. And I did, I played one of the Tron things, like the, the bike thing

201
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,800
that, it's kind of like light bike mixed with the Sonic 2 bonus level. Yeah. I think it's

202
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,240
kind of, well, let me put it this way. It's kind of basic, but it does Tron better than

203
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,360
the Tron PS3 game did bike racing, which was awful. The bike racing, like, killed that

204
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,200
Tron game. It was so bad. So. I thought it was, it was weak, but it's still better than,

205
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,800
yeah, yeah. It's better than Yaris. Um, but not by much. Uh, let's see. Uh, also some

206
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,720
new games I've been playing, not really a new game, but like Dark Soccer, I bought the

207
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,560
indie bundle and I can't stop playing Cave Story, which is like a years old game, came

208
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,080
out in a new one on the 3DS and dah, dah, dah, but Cave Story Plus to be specific is

209
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,240
the one that you get with the bundle. If you pay more than the average, I love it. Like

210
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,640
if you haven't played this game, you should definitely, I mean, for one, this indie bundle

211
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,800
that's out right now is amazing. And I know there's a story coming up on the show later.

212
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,800
We'll tell you all the games that are in it, but it's, it's just such a great cause, great

213
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,720
deal, great games. And especially the games you're getting this time around, like what?

214
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,960
Super Meat Boy and Bit.Trip Runner. Yeah. You convinced me with Bit.Trip Runner. Oh,

215
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,200
Bit.Trip Runner is a great game too. So, um, yeah, but Cave Story, it's kind of like, it

216
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,320
reminds me of an old NES game, obviously with the graphics and the music, the music's great.

217
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,880
And I guess now you get the soundtracks, which is awesome. Uh, and it kind of reminded me,

218
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,560
I wanted to say, I don't know why, but like Fashanadu, you remember that game? Uh, it

219
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,120
kind of reminded me of that a little bit, even though it wasn't really the swords, but

220
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,160
it was kind of like that exploring the different multiple screens and kind of the music reminded

221
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,200
me of it a little bit. So yeah, Cave Story's awesome. I like that game. And, um, otherwise

222
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,760
been playing some old school Game Boy advanced games as a 3DS ambassador, namely WarioWare

223
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,360
is the one that I can't stop playing. The original WarioWare was so good. And I'm so

224
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,880
glad that that's a part of the, uh, ambassador package. Cause that, that alone is worth it.

225
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,720
So yeah, that's pretty much it for my gaming week otherwise. Um, so we're going to move

226
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,680
on into some housekeeping before I get into housekeeping. I want to talk quickly. Uh,

227
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,920
we're going to have an interview in a little bit and it's with my friend Justin. He's going

228
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,800
to call in in about five minutes or so after we get through some other announcements here.

229
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,440
And he's going to talk to us about his Xbox hack experience. And, um, I know you guys

230
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,920
have heard about mine and I came on here and I bitched about it and how I couldn't play

231
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,400
my Xbox for 20 days and it was pretty bad and all this, but like my story has got nothing

232
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,280
on what you're about to hear Justin talk about. And I thought it was important to get it out

233
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,580
there that this is happening because when you guys hear like the, the hoops he's jumping

234
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,740
through and what's going on, your jaw will be on the floor and like, he's not making

235
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,520
it up. It's all legit. Like I trust Justin. Justin, uh, met at E3 and, and, uh, you know,

236
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,920
we hung out and stuff, so I know it's all legit and it's, um, you're going to be shocked.

237
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,640
So we'll get to that in a little bit, but first, um, some important housekeeping we

238
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,240
wanted to cover tonight. Um, there will be no show next week. Uh, most important, uh,

239
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,360
our show happens to be on December 25th, which, uh, you know, it's kind of a big deal for

240
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,260
some people. Um, and, uh, so yeah, no show that night. Bobby will still be live. So if

241
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,360
you're at all games radio and you're like, I'm lonely, I want to party with somebody

242
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,120
on Christmas. Bobby will still be here at five o'clock Pacific. We will not. And, um,

243
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,620
even also, uh, I'm kidding. Love, love. I said on Twitter and I said on Facebook and

244
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,800
I wasn't lying. Um, we have to say goodbye tonight. And, um, things change. And, um,

245
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,560
Dark Sakura, uh, well, do you want to tell the listeners what's going on? I don't know

246
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:59,720
how much you don't want to say, but I'm leaving. I'm moving. It's been coming for a while and

247
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,120
it's finally happened. And I know I've brought it up before, but the move is actually happening.

248
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:14,160
Um, we had pack up and be out and so we are moving down the street. So we're saying goodbye

249
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,320
to the orange lounge radio studio five. Bye. But maybe you made someone's heart skip a

250
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
beat there a little bit, but unfortunately that was so awesome. That was a, it was, it

251
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,080
was looking pretty scary there for a minute that you might have to move. Yeah. Dan still

252
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,640
wants us to go to Washington, but I'm like, so, um, so this is the fifth. You will still

253
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,040
have a show me at your feet. Yes, I will. That'll be great. Uh, this is the fifth studio

254
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,000
that we've taped to orange on radio in. Um, the first was that house that I had with Brian

255
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,560
back in the day. I don't think ever came on the show, but that was, that house was the

256
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,240
first studio. The second studio was when Loki and I lived together. Uh, the third studio

257
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
is when the extra for and I lived together and that was a lot of change to the station.

258
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,120
That was the studio where the news came out and filmed us. That was a studio where we

259
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,680
switched to all teams radio. By the way, what's that? They also came to your guys's place

260
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,320
to yours and Loki's. Oh, that's right. The paper did. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I got a foot

261
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:19,380
on there. Fantastic. So, uh, let's see. And then, um, the news did come here. The net,

262
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,040
the fourth studio was when I was in the house in the garage, in the garage, the cold, the

263
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:31,000
jet, the one that's on Justin TV, super hot. Sometimes the garage with no steady temperature.

264
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,160
And then we've been in this studio for well over a year. It's been at least, yeah, probably

265
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,960
almost two years, but my house is comfortable and has a heater. And sure me, you've got

266
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,920
sure me to keep your feet warm. So, um, and by the way, there's a, our chats finally catching

267
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,600
up with a buffer and everything. Just reading a, some of our chat room chat that orange

268
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,840
on twitter.com red said, you guys had me for a sec. Uh, bochi Kawa says, OMGs. I was scurred.

269
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,520
Uh, catastrophic. Moggy says, yeah, my heart did skip a beat. Rob and Darth spasinator

270
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,700
sums it up best. Damn you. Dark Sakura making us think you're leaving OLR. That was good.

271
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,240
You did that very well. Orange rice said, oh, you trolls, but no, I mean, but it is

272
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,320
still, I mean, obviously the studio is a big part of the show and, and here's the interesting

273
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,120
thing. Um, you know, we're, we had a planned week off next week. Anyway, we're going to

274
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,760
be back in two weeks. Hopefully it's looking like 90% sure we'll be back in two weeks.

275
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,080
There is a strong possibility though. We may not, we may not be set up in time because

276
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,160
we are now unexpectedly having to move the studios. Um, the, the office is going to be

277
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,760
a little smaller. I can tell you that, but we'll, we should be fine. We also don't exactly

278
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,640
know where studio six is going to be. We think it's going to be a dark sacros. You just have

279
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,140
to make sure it's going to work cause it might come back to where I'm at. So from an undisclosed

280
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,480
location is where the next orange lounge radio will be. So it's going to be a whole new year,

281
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,480
a whole new OLR, but what an appropriate way to kick off our 10th year of radio from 2002

282
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,320
to 2012 with a new studio. You know what, I'm going to go ahead and say it. What's that?

283
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,280
Fuck you, Wells Fargo. What's that for? Oh, cause I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Why we're moving.

284
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:20,120
You know what, honestly, it's not even, it's, it's a case of overextension when with combined

285
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:28,360
with the housing market drop is what facilitated our situation. But man, I tell you, apartments

286
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,280
are freaking expensive. And then like we got a house for what apartment rent for a smaller

287
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,780
place would have been. So it's really expensive where Dan works too. But I mean, so right

288
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,600
now though, and we got a good landlord who is really going to work with us. So, and honestly

289
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,600
we found his house, called him the next day. Two days later we're in. Nice. So yeah, I

290
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,400
worked out really well. I'm sure people who followed me on my Facebook knew about the

291
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,180
drama. So, uh, Tiger Claw on chat says, I guess the studio where you and Travis did

292
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,800
the shows was studio number one. I didn't count that one cause we didn't do orange lounge

293
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,920
radio from there. That was under station live, different show. And besides, he didn't really

294
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,400
call that studio one. I believe that was what the masturbation station inside the pleasure

295
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,640
dome, beautiful inbred Sacramento. I don't know, whatever he called it. So no, that,

296
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,840
that, that didn't have a number. That was studio zero. Um, let's see. Uh, and, uh, Zethur

297
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,880
says, I knew you guys were joking. We're not joking. We are saying goodbye to the studio.

298
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,360
Yeah, no, we were joking. I am leaving this house. Dark Sakura is moving. We have to be

299
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:44,200
out of here by the third so that we get money. So yeah. Oh, and, and Bobby, just to let you

300
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,480
know, um, our next step is to buy a house. So yeah. Good luck. All right. So, um, we'll

301
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,000
be back in two weeks from somewhere. Welcome to adult life kids. This is what you have

302
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,160
to look forward to. Growing up sucks. Life's going to suck when you grow up. When you grow

303
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,600
up, when you grow up, life's going to suck when you grow up. It sucks pretty bad right

304
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,760
now. Uh, okay. So I guess that's, what else can we say about that? I don't think there

305
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,760
is anything else to say about that. So goodbye studio five after tonight. Maybe the good

306
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,880
news is maybe we can get a webcam again. Maybe we can be better wired to stream games because

307
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,880
this studio is really kind of supposed to get a rig. Well, wasn't supposed to be temporary.

308
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,760
Yeah. You're on my drawing table. It just kind of lasted. Although I got it at Ikea

309
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,680
and it's not really a drawing table. So whatever. I'm just glad to tell you though, our house,

310
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,200
our new house is super cute. You know what I just realized? What? This is one of my old

311
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,720
roommates folding chairs. I totally jacked it from him for the studio. So we can bring

312
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,240
a piece of the old studio with us. That's right. We can. But man, this house though

313
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,120
is super cute and we'll get to keep the pinball tables in the living room. That's good. Pinball

314
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,120
tables are important. Our landlord walked in today cause he came in to sign the papers

315
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,920
with us and he looked in the, in the pinball room. It was like, what is this? We're like,

316
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,320
this is our coolness, sir. It was like, I haven't seen pinball in years. I was like,

317
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,440
that's super cool. You knock off a few hundred dollars a month and uh, yeah, maybe traded.

318
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,000
Well we, I offered up my services to if any of his grandchildren needed posters made for

319
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,200
their projects. Nice. So cause I'm shameless. I'll work for anybody. I'm a designer, dammit.

320
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,400
Give me design stuff to do. All right. Um, I think we're going to move into some of tonight's

321
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,560
news, but we need to be a little bit flexible cause the interview should be calling in any

322
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,840
minute. So we might have to kind of like go, go cause there's a live interview tonight.

323
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,800
So if you want to ask questions, you can in chat.orangelandraday.com. Um, so Loki, I guess

324
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,600
go ahead and try and start us off here. We might have to kind of cut it in the middle

325
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,920
here. Sure. Why not? Um, if there's a report coming from Bloomberg, same, and this is basically

326
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,800
saying something that they've already kind of rumored to before. Microsoft is going to

327
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,720
create its own TV programming for Xbox live, which is great cause I was hoping they would

328
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,120
kind of do that cause as much as I like to see on demand stuff for Comcast, which I can

329
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,920
get by an on demand, well I used to be able to get via on demand, but unfortunately now

330
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,480
we have a terrible, terrible, really low tech cable box that doesn't have on demand. Not

331
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,480
that I care. Um, but it would be nice to see extra content on top of the stuff that's already

332
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,240
there. And honestly, I haven't really looked at some of the other stuff that they have.

333
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,600
I looked at YouTube and TMZ and all that this week and it's kind of weak. I didn't, I, I

334
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,160
mean, I guess, yay, you can look at YouTube's on your Xbox, but I don't like the interface.

335
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,500
They really just force everything to use that, that new interface and it doesn't really work

336
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,320
well for something like YouTube. I feel like if I want to watch something, what I really

337
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,640
need to do to make it work is to go queue it up on my computer, in my playlist, and

338
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,580
then go to my Xbox and watch it on the Xbox. I mean, if you want to watch like popular

339
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,920
YouTubes and things like that, like that's really easy to find cause it shows you the

340
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,000
most popular. What about like a stuff you're subscribing to? Is it easy to find that? Um,

341
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,560
yeah, that, that, that does all kind of pop up. It's not, it's not bad. You can link it

342
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,600
to your YouTube. Basically, um, you say link to my YouTube account and it'll show you a code on

343
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,800
the screen and you go run to your computer and type that code in while you're signed

344
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,200
into Google and then it links the two together. Kind of like how Netflix works. So, but it

345
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,840
works. I mean, it's fantastic. Why? I don't know. This sounds stupid. Here's, here's the

346
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,720
thing and I don't know if you know this, Logie. Um, you can't watch any clip that's been flagged

347
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,280
for copyright content. Like, you know how like YouTube will keep some of the copyright

348
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,280
content stuff up, but it'll just have a link to whatever song is being used in it at the

349
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,480
bottom. You know, say like this has stuff from UMG music group and click here to buy

350
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,520
the song though. All of those are pulled from Xbox live, which I act, I get why because,

351
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,360
you know, there's all the jukebox usage rights and all that stuff and they don't want to

352
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,080
pay it, but it does put a damper on some of the things that you want to really watch on

353
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,960
YouTube. But like I would think like, okay, like the way that Jamie and Dan have it set

354
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,720
up, they watch YouTube's a lot on their TV of like game play throughs and stuff, but

355
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,080
I don't think they should have to change that. But not everybody sets up a rig like that.

356
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,240
Yeah. Well, here's the thing though. It's like an, and I understand that it's kind of

357
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,040
cool that they have that and stuff, but I'll, I'll tell you this much. To get a rig to actually

358
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:25,880
watch YouTube videos on a TV, um, is fucking dirt cheap. I mean, so dirt cheap. It's ridiculous.

359
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,000
I remember actually one time, uh, well I was last year actually that, um, not actually

360
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,280
this year, I was doing that, was it project under $100 thing where I was going to create

361
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,880
a main cabinet under a hundred dollars. Yeah, whatever happened to that? Yeah, I just didn't,

362
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,680
I didn't want to build a main cabinet out of cardboard boxes. So I came out to $101

363
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,320
and you were like, shit. No, no, I was able to do it under a hundred dollars, but, um,

364
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,640
I just didn't want to. I saw the computer and stuff though in my garage, but I bought

365
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,600
the computer for 30 bucks. It's a Pentium 4 for 30 bucks and it was, I mean, it's capable

366
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,760
of running MAME and most of the games for, but a Pentium 4 computer can also run YouTube.

367
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,680
I mean, I think for the most part and hell, you can even get like, you know, mini ITX

368
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,440
computers or Adam computers or whatever. Um, very, very dirt cheap if you want to set up

369
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,240
something that's mainly for watching YouTube videos or fuck any other, if you have a computer

370
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,800
at home, it's moving next to the computer, you know, to your TV and you can watch videos

371
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,460
that way. I mean, that's, it's just a lot easier than having the fuck around with these

372
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,760
apps and stuff. And to me, it's sad that they have it that way. That's so difficult to just

373
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
have it work.

374
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,720
I'm going to jump in here. We're going to come back to the subject in a little bit,

375
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,840
but as I promised a little bit earlier, um, I'm waiting for a phone call and that phone

376
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,320
call is coming in right now. So, hi caller, are you there?

377
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Hello.

378
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
Hey, is this Justin?

379
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Sure is.

380
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,120
What is up Justin? First off, thank you so much for calling in tonight. Um, you're like

381
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,680
on vacation or something right now, right?

382
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,520
I am. I'm a halfway home from Disneyland. Me and the lady, uh, drove out there. I got

383
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,280
a couple of days. We're heading back to Vegas now.

384
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,920
Nice. I saw you did my tip at Haunted Mansion on Foursquare.

385
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,440
Yeah. Yeah. I think you left a couple tips throughout Disneyland and I did whatever I

386
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
found.

387
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,680
I probably did. Well, that's awesome. Well, anyway, um, Justin, thanks for calling in

388
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,340
tonight. Um, I, let me, I tried to give a little bit of background before you called

389
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,280
in tonight, but I know everybody knows you're calling in to talk about Xbox hacks tonight

390
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,360
and I got to say, I've been following your updates through Twitter because you and I

391
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,360
got hacked kind of around the same time, but it seems like your shit has been going on

392
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:36,600
forever. And yeah, it lasted four months and I've, I've seen your updates on Facebook and

393
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,600
it came to the point where I'm like, Justin, I, I need you to call in and tell this story

394
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,000
because people need to hear how bad Microsoft is dicking people around with this. So I think

395
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,480
for people to better understand this, let's go back to the beginning.

396
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,240
So let's talk about day one. First time you ever found out your Xbox got hacked. What

397
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,880
happened? How'd you find out you were hacked?

398
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,920
All right. Uh, let me start by saying I am on the road and if signal cuts out, you know,

399
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,360
I'll call back, but just let me know if the signal starts cutting out, we'll, we'll make

400
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:11,840
it work. So day one back in August, it was like August, uh, mid August, say the 13th,

401
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:19,560
14th, something like that. Uh, I get an email saying that, uh, my, the, what was it? I got

402
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,560
a purchase confirmation for, uh, altogether $125 worth of Microsoft points.

403
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,400
Was it all that FIFA stuff? Was it the FIFA stuff?

404
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,200
What's that? Was it the FIFA 12 stuff that it seems like

405
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,080
No, actually, uh, the FIFA stuff, I, mine had nothing to do with any of the FIFA stuff.

406
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,880
I heard a ton of people get screwed over by the FIFA thing. Uh, and apparently that was

407
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,480
because there's something you can do on FIFA where it equates to real money. I guess that

408
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,640
like people are building these super teams at FIFA, uh, by purchasing, uh, players, uh,

409
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,240
they have booster packs basically. And then they're selling the killer teams on Hebay

410
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,040
or what have you. So that's why people get screwed over with the FIFA stuff. But mine

411
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,320
was not related to that at all. I got one confirmation for 75 bucks and then another

412
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:17,720
one for 50 bucks. Uh, I got, I found it probably a couple hours after it happened. So I went

413
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,360
in, I checked, uh, checked all my stuff. I had to reset my password to get in there.

414
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,840
Saw that they had bought a bunch of, uh, I think they bought Alan Wake, Resident Evil

415
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:36,040
5, uh, some DLC for both of those, Assassin's Creed brotherhoods, DLC for that, some themes,

416
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,200
uh, and then just some other miscellaneous stuff. But it was all just kind of random

417
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,320
stuff. I thought that they had played a little bit of them. So I called Microsoft, well first

418
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,600
I called the bank. I called bank of America and I said, Hey, fraudulent charges, yada

419
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,320
yada. They said, okay, we'll just take care of it. Next day they had my money back. So

420
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,000
no problems there. I called Microsoft right after I called the bank and I told them what

421
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
had happened and they said, okay, well, uh, we're sorry this happened. We're going to

422
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,960
close your countdown while we look into it and we'll have this taken care of within 25

423
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,440
business days or something like that. There would be no longer than 25 to 30 days.

424
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,440
One thing I want to jump in here and point out real quick, just one small difference

425
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,880
between what you did and what I did is that you called your bank first and I didn't do

426
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,680
that. I called, or I called Microsoft first and I think, yeah, I find that kind of interesting

427
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,200
because I wonder if that's part of the reason why here's story's going to take a different

428
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,760
turn here in a minute. But anyway, sorry. I just want to point that out. Go ahead.

429
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,320
Okay. So yeah, I, uh, I waited a little while, uh, probably three or four weeks and then

430
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,160
I called back and said, Hey, just checking in. Just want to see what's going on. And

431
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,800
I said, well, you know, we're still working on it. I said, okay, cool. So I waited a little

432
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,080
bit longer, a couple of weeks past. And at this point we're past the 25 days they had

433
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,760
voted me. So I called back and I said, Hey, uh, you know, you guys missed your deadline.

434
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,180
I just wanted to get a status update, find out what's going on. You know, same as before

435
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,920
they were apologetics. Uh, they didn't have any news for me. They told me there's nothing

436
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,600
they can do to, uh, figure out, uh, with any more detail what's actually going on. Uh,

437
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,720
now I just have to stick it out. So at that point I said, well, can you guys hook me up

438
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,080
with anything to make a support? They said, sure. Here's the code for a free month of

439
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,840
Xbox live. And, uh, they assured me that that would be on top of whatever time I get reimbursed

440
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,800
at the end of the whole fiasco. So I said, all right, we'll, we'll three months, a live

441
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,960
whatever hung up one about my business, few more weeks past. And I called back and, uh,

442
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,120
they said the same thing. I whined about it a little more. They gave me another code for

443
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,640
a month of live. And that was that few more weeks past. And this is the point where I

444
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,920
started taking angry Facebook posts, Twitter posts, Google plus posts, trying to get screwed

445
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,880
over here. At this point, you've said a few weeks, a few weeks, a few weeks. So you're

446
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,920
talking like you're at like 10, 12 weeks at this point, right? Were you somewhere between

447
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,980
two and three months, around two months is when I started getting really upset because

448
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,680
I wasn't playing my Xbox a whole lot. I figured at least I'll have this all sorted by the

449
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,160
time all the good games start coming out, I'll be able to play modern warfare three

450
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,440
and all that stuff. Right. So the, when I really got upset was the day modern warfare

451
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,440
three came out. Now I'm not a fan of the modern warfare series, but I figured this was going

452
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,720
to be here. I was going to get it, start playing with all my friends and get into all that

453
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,840
stuff. Well, I bought modern warfare three and then remembered, Oh, wait, I can't play

454
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,280
online. So I called against that night and I said, look, this wasn't a problem before

455
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,120
the games are starting to come out that I want to play. So I need to have this fixed

456
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,200
and same thing, just, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I don't have any more information.

457
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,280
We're very sorry this happened, but there's nothing we can do. So what else can I do?

458
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,840
You know, I was starting to feel pretty hopeless at this point. I said, okay, well deal with

459
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,640
it. And I went, played some, I started playing something on my Wii, I think. I went back

460
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,160
and started playing Mario Galaxy or something. So a couple more weeks passed and I'm at the

461
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,920
point where I'm telling them every time I call like, look, I'm going to call every week

462
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,880
now and keep on doing this until I, until I get a result. And I did so I kept on calling

463
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,000
and every time they just would give me the run around and say, no, there's nothing we

464
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,800
can do. So about a week ago I called and I don't know about a week ago I got an email

465
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,760
saying, Hey, we see that you got, you regained access to your account. So we're closing your

466
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,680
case, have fun. And I was on my way to work at this time so I could check on it immediately.

467
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,240
But when I got to work, I went online and I checked it out and I still couldn't get

468
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,840
to my account via xbox.com and still said your account is temporarily blocked.

469
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,720
And to point this out, you're talking from August to a week ago, December.

470
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah. Yeah. From mid August until last week. So I got the email that said that everything

471
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,120
was good. I went to xbox.com and found out that everything was not good because I still

472
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,480
couldn't get to my account. So I called them on my lunch break and I said, look, I got

473
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
this email. I mean, it's been going on since August, try and understand my frustration

474
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,360
here. Like I apologize upfront because I knew I was going to get hostile at some point during

475
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:27,040
a phone call. So I told them the whole situation, let them read over my case notes, gave them

476
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,000
like three service requests numbers I had, uh, told them, you know, I want to be able

477
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,080
to play my xbox. You know, I got this email, but I still can't get to my account. And they

478
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,480
said, Oh, okay, we'll go to your console. And I said, well, I'm not at my console on

479
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,080
my lunch break. So they said, all right, we'll call it back later when you're at your console.

480
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,480
And at this point I really felt like I would get ripped off here. So I asked them if they

481
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,400
could do anything like give me a year of xbox live to pick up for it. Cause what's a year

482
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,880
of xbox live, 40 or 50 bucks. Right. Right. So, so I asked them that and they said, no,

483
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,280
actually we can't do that. That's kind of what I was expecting, but I will talk to someone

484
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,640
who can hook that up and she said, well, let me talk to my supervisor, but you won't be

485
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,800
able to do anything either. So supervisor came on, told her the whole situation after

486
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,520
a year of life. She said, no, I can't do that. I can get you, uh, two extra months. We see

487
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,800
that you already got two months before I can give you two more months and that I'll pick

488
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,280
up for the four months that you lost. And that'll be that. And at this point I'm a little

489
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,560
angry because before I got those two one month codes, they told me that those months would

490
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,680
be on top of whatever time I was reimbursed. So I relate this information to the supervisor

491
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,520
I was now talking to and she said, well, you were misinformed. We can give you two months

492
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:55,280
or not take it or leave it. And so I, I mean, I, I never, ever yell at people on the phone

493
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,080
because I know they have jobs and I would hate to be answered. So I blew up at this

494
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,720
point. I just, you know, kind of let her have it. I said, look, I mean, this is four months.

495
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,880
You don't, I don't think you understand how much trouble this has been for me. I've been

496
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,440
on the phone literally like five or six hours total with Microsoft trying to get this resolved

497
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,640
and all because don't jerk off, pack an alert bank account or hacked into my Xbox account

498
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:27,000
and spent a bunch of my money. Like I feel like I'm being punished for nothing. I did.

499
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,080
And she was not very receptive to that. She took kind of reiterated, I can give you two

500
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,240
months on top of two months where he gave you about that. So we went back and forth.

501
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,800
You know, I kept on saying that it's ridiculous. This is ridiculous. She kept sitting there

502
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,160
with nothing to do. Finally, she conceded and said, okay, well I'll give you 500 points

503
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,280
in addition to the two bucks. And yeah, exactly. I said, what is that, six bucks? Like is that

504
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,280
one of my five or six dollars? What does that translate to, five hundred bucks?

505
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Six twenty five.

506
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah, six twenty five.

507
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,840
Six twenty five. Okay. So yeah, we're six dollars and twenty five cents for Microsoft

508
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,800
at the cost of that. And I told her like, you realize you're about to lose a customer

509
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,960
over, you know, 50 bucks, right? Because all I'm asking for is a year and a half, that's

510
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,680
it. She just kept on reiterating. She couldn't do anything. So I took what I could get from

511
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,680
her because my lunch break was over. I had to get back to work. I left her my contact

512
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,280
info and asked her to have her supervisor. Oh, right. I asked to speak to her supervisor

513
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,880
earlier on the call and she said that he wouldn't be in until the next day in the evening. So

514
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,200
she was apparently the highest level person I could talk to at that time. So, so anyway,

515
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,440
she said she would pass along my contact information to her boss and have him call me back, which

516
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,960
never happened, by the way. So later that night, I actually, sorry, when I got back

517
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,400
from lunch, when I was back in my office, I typed out that quick Google Plus post basically

518
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,800
saying like, this is what's going on. You know, an update because I posted probably

519
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,720
three or four times previous after each call and kind of updated everyone as to what's

520
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,320
going on. I don't know how many people actually cared or if it looked like I was starting

521
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,400
to be whining, but I had to get it out somewhere, you know, I just couldn't just let it go without

522
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:27,120
telling people what was going on. So, uh, I made that post on Facebook and Google Plus.

523
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,000
And at that point I linked to my public Google Plus post on my Twitter account and I cc'd

524
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,760
Toulouse and is that how you say his name? Toulouse? Toulouse? Anyway, that guy and Major

525
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,200
Nelson. And Major Nelson actually replied to me on Google Plus that, sorry, I had a

526
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,000
bad experience. Shoot me an email with your gamertag and your service request number and

527
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,280
let me see if I can figure out what's going on. So I sent him an email the next day. He

528
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,040
said, all right, cool. I'm going to investigate it. And a few hours later I got a call from

529
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:06,520
Beth at Exceptions Management. She was, yeah, they have an exceptions management department.

530
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,240
So I spoke to Beth for a while. She was amazing, super friendly, super personable, very empathetic,

531
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,080
helps me get everything sorted. She went and got my account unlocked for me while I was

532
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,040
on the phone, waited for me to make sure I could get into it.

533
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,600
Just to make it clear, just to make it clear before, just to make it clear, before you

534
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,520
could get to this person who could actually handle your issue and take care of everything

535
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,760
right there on the spot. It sounds like she had the button. You had to go through Major

536
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,160
Nelson to get to her. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let's step back even further here. They

537
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,000
have a department for people that make exceptions to the rule. What?

538
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,840
I pointed out to her like, you know, this would have been so much easier if the supervisor

539
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,680
earlier could have just taken care of this for me. And she said, no, they actually can't

540
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,160
do that. They don't have that ability. But Beth, who I was speaking to, didn't have the

541
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
ability.

542
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't have the ability to help you. Oh my gosh. Okay. So, so Beth or whoever, finally,

543
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,560
it sounds like satisfies you. Like, you know, what, what, what did they hook you up with

544
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
in the end?

545
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Yeah, well, so she took care of me and she was like, okay, well, we're all set. And without

546
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,600
even asking, she said, well, how about, you know, I know you have them for a year report.

547
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,120
How about six months? That's, you know, I think that's what I could really get away

548
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,520
with doing. At that point, I was just so happy that she was willing to help me and all that.

549
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,320
She kind of offered it without me bugging about it. I said, okay, six months is fine.

550
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,360
So she gave me a couple coats for, you know, two, three-month coats to redeem. And you

551
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,240
know, I was happy with that. I got a little something for it. I felt like Microsoft was

552
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,320
trying to appease me at that point. And I was just happy I could get back into my account.

553
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,680
So all's better, right? All's well that ends well, right? We're done?

554
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,760
Uh, well, not yet. Not yet. Uh, we're almost done. So I go home and I play a couple games

555
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,600
online. Everything's cool. Next morning I wake up and as I'm driving to work, I see

556
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,240
I get an email that says, Hey, we noticed you added a new email to your account, which

557
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:07,420
I did not do. And it's some Oscar hyphen four one eight at hotmail.com or something random

558
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,520
like that. And so, I mean, yeah, I got hacked again, less than 24 hours after this is all

559
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,880
resolved. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

560
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,680
wait, wait, wait. Put the brakes on. Hold on. You, you were out of your Xbox live account

561
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,400
for four months. Finally, thanks to major Nelson, you get back in 24 hours later, 24

562
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,240
hours later, you're hacked again. Yes. So I said, screw this. I'm not talking to Microsoft

563
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:42,000
again. Oh damn it. Now we're getting the service job. Hold on. Can you still hear us? Oh, hi,

564
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,840
go, go back. Go back a little bit. We lost you for a second. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so I got

565
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:54,840
the email. I, uh, sorry. Got a, that'll, I lost track there. Uh, let's say I walked in

566
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:02,000
on my phone to Xbox.com, went to change my password and all that stuff. Uh, as soon as

567
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,920
I got to work, I, you know, delete all my email accounts. I associated my account with

568
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,560
new email accounts, changed my password to something completely new that's never been

569
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,280
used anywhere. Uh, made sure that this person had not made any purchases on my account.

570
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,960
All my points were still there. There was no activity. So I just booted that email address

571
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,880
off my account and, uh, made everything, you know, brand new basically. So far since then

572
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,360
everything is cool. Okay. I have to ask these questions because listeners will kill me if

573
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,720
I don't ask these questions to get some things clear. You changed your password between the

574
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,080
first time and the second time, right? Yes. It was, it was not a brand new password. It

575
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,800
was one that I'd used in other places before. So one theory that I have is that maybe this

576
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,280
traces back to when all, you know, all the websites and Stoney and all that got hacked.

577
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,840
Maybe, uh, they got my password from something like that associated better, but it was not

578
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,640
my same password from before. But it was still different. They, they somehow got two different

579
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,320
passwords a year. Yeah. And I think, I was wondering also maybe they, uh, they hacked

580
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,600
into the email account that was associated with my Xbox account and that's how they were

581
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,120
doing it. Because if you have the email account, you can reset the password, you can get a

582
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,440
reset link sent to that email address. That could make sense. I don't know, maybe they

583
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,640
did something like that or maybe they did some social engineering and, uh, got a service

584
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,120
rupture request to reset it or something like that. But, you know, that stuff happens. I

585
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,200
usually pretty careful with this stuff. Do you think you were phished? Because I, that's

586
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,560
the line that Xbox has been saying is that, well, all these people are getting phished

587
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,280
and I'm like, the fuck I was getting phished. Man, I've been on the internet since I was

588
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,800
11 years old. I didn't get phished. Like I, I'm smarter than that. I don't click on links

589
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,640
that I don't know where they came from. Whenever I get any sort of email that says, hey, we're,

590
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,840
we need you to log in here or something like that, I don't click the link. I open a browser

591
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,880
and I type in the URL, you know, so I'm positive that I didn't get phished. And that's an easy

592
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,560
thing for a company to say, you know, put the blame on the users and make them think

593
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,520
that it's not their fault.

594
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,560
So, all right. So since, since we got to, we got to wrap this up and get back to the

595
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,040
show at some point, but I want to, I want to just kind of summarize here. You were hacked.

596
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,560
You went through four months of hoops. Finally, after getting Major Nelson involved, you speak

597
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,160
to the super secret department of Microsoft who can actually fix things when you talk

598
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,800
to them. 24 hours later, you're hacked again.

599
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:40,920
Yeah. So I want to, I want to make sure that I emphasize that Major Nelson, once I got

600
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,640
to that point, super helpful. Everything was taken care of pretty quickly. Microsoft just

601
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:51,860
really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the initial, you know, interactions.

602
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,040
When this happens, they need to be a lot more swift with this, their, their investigation

603
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,000
team, as they kept calling it, needs to be more accessible and they need to get this

604
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,560
stuff done faster because the fact that I had to get Major Nelson involved, I mean,

605
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,440
I felt terrible trying to get his attention on Twitter to get this taken care of in the

606
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,640
first place. But once I did, everything was taken care of. So I don't want to encourage

607
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,280
people to just tweet at Major Nelson when other things go wrong. But I mean, that's,

608
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,640
that's what I ended up having to do to make this work. That's just insane.

609
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,920
Yes. And you know, what else is insane is that I'm seeing, I'm looking in our chat room

610
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,200
at chat.orangetontrader.com and I see MXT is in our chat room saying, I'm going through

611
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,440
the exact same thing that the guy they're interviewing is. This story is crazy similar

612
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,480
to what I'm going through. Microsoft is telling me that I'm not properly verifying the account

613
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,640
details, even though I successfully verified everything to start the investigation and

614
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,760
I've been using the same information. So it's not just you buddy, but Microsoft denies there's

615
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
a problem.

616
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,960
Yeah. And I know that you got, you got hacked and I've heard a few other people like I,

617
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,760
I posted one that initially happened, uh, uh, I write for Nukesilla. So I posted a story

618
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,760
on there, uh, basically saying, Hey, I just got hacked. So PSA, you know, I want to change

619
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,800
your password. So I got a bunch of comments on there. Probably half a dozen people saying

620
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,920
the same thing was happening to them. And I Googled around, found a ton of other people

621
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,920
get hacked. So, I mean, it's not an isolated issue. This is something that's happening

622
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,880
a lot. I don't know what the common thread is, but it's not, uh, something that only

623
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,680
a few people are getting hit by. And I've talked to a lot of other people like friends

624
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,320
of mine who said, Oh yeah, I just had to go through that too.

625
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,600
So, so what happens from here? Do you, do you think this is something you can put behind

626
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,200
you in a couple months and say, all right, whatever, I'm a Microsoft fan again, woohoo,

627
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,840
Modern Warfare on my Xbox, pew pew. Or like, has this like permanently damaged things?

628
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,080
It's, I mean, there's, there's definitely permanent damage. Uh, I think it's insane

629
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:59,240
that Sony got basically crucified for the hacks a few months ago, but I can't think

630
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,000
of a single instance in which anybody actually got, there was any fraudulent credit card

631
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,400
activity. You know, I didn't care if anybody actually losing money over that, but this

632
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,520
is going on with Microsoft and it's widespread and there's no press about it. I mean, people

633
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,760
aren't talking about this.

634
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,800
What can Microsoft do to mend those, make amends?

635
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,000
They need to fix their security holes, whatever they may be, or, uh, maybe send out a force

636
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,260
password reset. I don't know. They need to, they need to do something about it. I think

637
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,260
people need to be talking about this more so that people are more aware they can go

638
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,880
and change their passwords. Oh, one more thing I wanted to add to my story because I forgot

639
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,760
to mention it in the middle of it. Uh, they called me about a month in and said they needed

640
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,040
my console ID and serial number. I did not have that with me, so I called back a couple

641
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,120
of days and gave it to them, but they tried to use that as ammo when they were talking

642
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,080
about how long it was taking. They said, well, we needed the console ID and serial number,

643
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,120
so that resets the timer. And I said, well, you know, that was three months ago, but I

644
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,840
just wanted to throw that in there in the interest of having all the facts.

645
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,400
Fair enough. Fair enough. Still four months is pretty shitty.

646
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,280
Console ID and the serial number. I mean, they probably already have it.

647
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,280
How about look at where he's logging in from.

648
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,600
It took him a month to even ask me for that.

649
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,560
Silly. All right. Well, Justin, I got to wrap up so we can get back to tonight's news, but

650
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,680
thank you so much for calling in and sharing the story with you. I don't know what else

651
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,540
to say. I'm glad you got resolution for Microsoft, but I agree with you. Microsoft needs to admit

652
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,040
there's a problem more than putting the, because what Microsoft's doing here, and there's a

653
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,680
pattern. It's what happened to you. It's what they're saying on the internet. It's what

654
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,000
they're saying to MXT. They're saying the user base is the problem. We're the problem.

655
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,560
We're getting phished. We're causing the issues. We're not providing the console ID numbers

656
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,560
in time. The customer is not right, is what I'm hearing from Microsoft.

657
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,360
No, I did not get phished. I mean, it's definitely something on Microsoft's end. I mean, I'm

658
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,320
still going to play games on my Xbox, but I'm definitely going to be playing more games

659
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,640
on my PS3 as well.

660
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,320
Hey, home just got a renovation there. It's worth checking out.

661
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,280
Well, I was just going to ask now, did you have the same email associated with your PlayStation

662
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,600
network account as you did with your Xbox Live account?

663
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,080
Yes, it was the same email address.

664
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,080
See, so that's the thing.

665
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,840
That's why I was thinking it might have something to do with it.

666
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,700
That's the thing is I think that what they're saying with these hacks is that it's not necessarily

667
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,880
that people are getting phished. I think it's just that people are getting in through their

668
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,200
email accounts. And it's not an intrusion to Microsoft's Xbox Live service. It's just

669
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,320
a different way. So people are getting phished that way or are getting hacked via their email

670
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,320
accounts.

671
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,880
Can I, I have to ask, DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?

672
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,240
Checking my account.

673
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,240
I recommend everybody do the same thing. For God's sake.

674
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,080
Everyone listening right now, log into Xbox.com right now. Change the email address associated

675
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,480
with your account. Change your password and change your security question.

676
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,720
I changed mine ages ago, but not well, not ages ago, but like about a month and a half

677
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
ago.

678
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,600
Right. Right. So, all right. Well, Justin, thank you again so much. And God, I hope it

679
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,520
I hope it doesn't happen a third time. What else can I say?

680
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,640
Well, thank you very much for having me.

681
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,160
All right. No problem. Drive safe. Oh, wait. Did you want to plug your site or anything?

682
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,160
What's that?

683
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,640
Did you want to plug your site or anything? I don't know if it's appropriate, but.

684
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:34,480
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Check out Nukeszilla.com. We're actually in the middle of a month-long

685
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,560
review, Nukes-travaganza right now, where every day we're writing a review of a game.

686
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,880
First day, we wrote one sentence for the review. Second day was a two-sentence review. That

687
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,800
was my Pokemon review, actually. Third day, we wrote a three-sentence review and so on

688
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
until the end of the month.

689
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
It is-

690
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,800
We're about halfway through that right now. Go check it out.

691
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,800
It is blowing up over there at Nukeszilla.com. All right.

692
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Absolutely.

693
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Take care, buddy.

694
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Bye.

695
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
All right. Bye.

696
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,800
Bye.

697
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,080
Wow, wow, and more wow.

698
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,560
Apparently, MXT in the chat was saying that, oh, my God, they did the same thing to me

699
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,000
as far as asking for the console ID and serial number.

700
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,240
What's that? Oh, what's that?

701
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,640
That they did the same thing to him.

702
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,680
Oh, MXT, really? Oh, my gosh.

703
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,680
But, yeah, so-

704
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,080
Well, I mean, think about it. We don't have that big of an audience when you consider

705
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,880
the entire internet. We have, what, maybe 50, 60 people in chat right now, right? And

706
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,200
the fact that Justin's on the phone and one out of these 50 people is like, oh, yeah,

707
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,400
I'm going through this, too. What? This isn't a problem?

708
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
It's redonkulous.

709
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,240
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

710
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,320
But it's the thing, though, is they're right in the fact that, yeah, it's not through-

711
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,920
I mean, if someone's getting access to your email account, how's that their problem?

712
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,280
I mean, that's not their fault that someone got access to your email because you happen

713
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,440
to use the same password that you use with the PlayStation Network stuff, and that list

714
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,440
got leaked out.

715
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,080
To be fair, Justin might have made a mistake if his email password and his Xbox Live were

716
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,120
the same. But, you know, whether he made a mistake or not, the hoops he's going through

717
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
is ridiculous.

718
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,800
But it doesn't even matter if those were the same because they can send a password reset.

719
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,800
Yeah, yeah.

720
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,320
But I think they still have to answer the security questions, if I'm ever correct. I

721
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,320
don't know.

722
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,440
I just want to say this real quick. Bobby Blackwell is sharing an idea with me. I don't

723
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,240
know if this will work for you or not. But he says, to help with the social engineering

724
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,780
aspect of it, change address line two in your account to read Xbox support. Do not assist

725
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,720
with recovery. That way, when the folks look at your account and see it, they won't try

726
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,280
to, you know, give- accidentally give out any information or make any changes or whatever

727
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,080
if somebody's trying to get it done that way. So, I find that interesting, an interesting

728
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,640
way to do it.

729
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,620
At the end of the day, honestly, I'm getting to the point where I'm using unique passwords

730
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,440
on different websites. Like, and it's kind of a pain in the ass to remember them all.

731
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,080
But it's like what I have to do. So, anyway.

732
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,200
All right. Moving on. We spent a good 20 minutes on that topic. But you know what? It's important.

733
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,880
And Justin's right. Not enough people are talking about it. And I said that back in

734
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,320
August. I'm saying it now. Like, at least we're finally saying like, okay, well, finally,

735
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:14,820
we're seeing that Xbox and EA's denying that there's a problem and warning people to not

736
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:21,160
get phished. I guess that's a baby step. But see, that's the thing, though, is they don't

737
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:32,840
even- you know, why didn't they just say, hey, you know, back- I mean, another video

738
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,320
game console provider or something like that, you know, was hacked earlier this year and

739
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:44,680
emails were leaked out. You may want to check that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if

740
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:51,880
they can't see that because that's, you know, untactful or whatever. But, I mean, obviously

741
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:58,800
there's something going on. There may be some sort of restrictions for how much you can

742
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,400
spend in a day or something like that.

743
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,400
I think they need to just do the force password reset. And they don't want to get right through

744
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,080
the holes like Sony did. They're scared shitless of what happened to Sony.

745
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,760
If they do a force password reset, people are going, why are you doing that? Oh, well,

746
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,040
because there's a lot of people getting hacked. I mean, they're not going to come out and

747
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,240
say that. It draws suspicion.

748
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,080
All right, let's move on with news. That took up a big chunk of time, so we want to quickly

749
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,080
get through this.

750
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,880
Real quick, to finish up the whole TV program, we think. So Bloomberg is saying that Microsoft

751
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,480
is on the hunt for a TV exec to handle the original programming. And they said they also

752
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:44,320
have some candidates with Mark Graboff and Jess Gaspin, two ex-NBC suits, I guess.

753
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,000
And they're saying that they're thinking the original programming via Xbox Live dashboard,

754
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,160
including like the Major's Minute, Xbox 101, et cetera, and also possible tie-ins with

755
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,720
like IGN, all that stuff.

756
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,120
Of course, they had MSNBC, so it makes sense to do that. And of course, this week they

757
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:11,600
had the launch of a few more applications, YouTube, TMZ, Verizon, FiOS, if you happen

758
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:20,960
to have that, and I believe, was it iHeartRadio, MSNBC, Muzu TV, if you're in some of the European

759
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:33,480
countries, Rogers On Demand in Canada, SBS On Demand in Australia, and RTVE in Spain,

760
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:41,880
and MSN Video in some of the European countries, and Blinkbox. All different streaming stuff

761
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
there.

762
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,400
TMZ, I haven't even looked at that. I don't even know.

763
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,560
I actually looked at the TMZ stuff. It's similar to the phone app. It's Celebrity Gossip. They

764
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,440
go out and get the videos, the raw footage of celebrities walking out of famous restaurants

765
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,920
and stuff. They do a live show that I think is broadcast on Sirius and all that. If you

766
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,000
like Hollywood gossip stuff, which I don't think many of you do, but that might be a

767
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,720
way for them to try and reach out to a different demographic.

768
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,240
Here's what I don't like about it, and I think it'd be awesome as if it was actually set

769
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,660
up like TV. Like you have channels. It would be awesome.

770
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:17,960
It's easier for me to log into a computer and type TMZ.com or hit a button on my phone.

771
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,480
I just don't think the Kinect interface is yet there. If I want to go check TMZ, I don't

772
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:29,320
go sit on my couch. Okay. Xbox, Kinect, TMZ, Bing.

773
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,300
I think they should have live TV or something like that as an option. They should have these

774
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:39,840
TMZ channels where they have some TMZ shows or whatever they're on at certain times, and

775
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:45,200
then you watch it actually like TV instead of having to... Because I think that would

776
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,000
be really cool, and that would get a lot more people interested in it because it's in addition

777
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,320
to their own TV. They can actually watch the Xbox TV instead of, oh, hey, look, I can queue

778
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,520
up all these videos. Yeah, you know what? You can do that with the PC, and I'm sure

779
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:03,120
most people out there have PCs even if you don't have an Xbox. Why would you bother downloading

780
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:09,160
this app and going through all this crap? It's more of a hassle.

781
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,440
Maybe once they have a remote control or something. I just don't think Kinect is as fast as they

782
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,960
want it to be. They do have a remote control. Do they? Yeah, maybe they have the little

783
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,240
infrared remotes. I agree with your whole thing. It needs to be channel up and channel

784
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,920
down or something like that to get to the stuff. It should be like web TV. Well, not

785
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:31,040
necessarily web TV, but like IPTV or something like that. Speaking of MSNBC, I want to break

786
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:37,680
in real quick with some real world news. What is it with world news going on in the middle

787
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,160
of our show? Because remember earlier this year, Osama bin Laden was reported dead and

788
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:47,120
all that. Well, they didn't kill anybody, but Kim Jong Il from North Korea has died

789
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,720
according to the Associated Press and it's on msnbc.com, which I mean, not to be crass.

790
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,760
I mean, it's sad when a world leader dies, I realize he's a controversial figure. I'm

791
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,040
just going to stay far away from that and just say, I believe it was reported he was

792
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,400
having, he had pancreatic cancer related issues. So, you know, and that was the same thing

793
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:16,000
that got Steve Jobs sadly. So that, um, cancer sucks. That's my point. So there you go. If

794
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,600
that, I mean, allegedly that's what obviously with world leaders, they're always very secretive,

795
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:27,360
but you know, there you have it. All right. Uh, moving on, uh, more gaming news. Who's

796
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:33,960
going to be making a death night of him in wow. And wow. Yeah. I remember my friend,

797
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,040
uh, from a hoard house. Matt, uh, had rip Steve Jobs already for the big day. All right.

798
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,640
Anyhow, uh, the circle pad is coming out in the U S that's of course the, you know, a

799
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,840
little attachment for the three ds and extra little thing there on the three ds. However,

800
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,720
uh, it's coming out February 7th, so it'll be out next year. It'll be $20, which I guess

801
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:58,800
is a reasonable price, but here's the deal. It's a GameStop exclusive yet again. Nintendo

802
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,000
has chosen to go the GameStop exclusive route, but this time I don't believe you can get

803
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,440
it on nintendo.com. Can you? I think you can only get this at GameStop. So if you want

804
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,760
the circle pad pro for 20 bucks, that will allow you a, an extra pad in resident evil

805
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,840
revelations, a metal gear, solid three d snake eater. Uh, you got to check that out at GameStop

806
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,240
only on February 7th. And I got two words for that. Fuck that. I hate this. I, you know,

807
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,160
you guys all know how I feel about it. It's no secret. I hate that it's all this exclusive

808
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,000
retailer stuff and I'm not going to support it and it pisses me off. I actually kind of

809
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,360
wanted that circle pad, but not for the reason you think. Um, I don't know about you guys,

810
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:44,120
but I've had my hand hurt playing Mario Kart because I don't think that the three ds is

811
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,880
very ergonomically designed very well because like my thumb like starts to hurt from the

812
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,320
acceleration button and trying to use the shoulder buttons for like a long period of

813
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,680
time. We have to kind of like hold the a button down. It's not bothered me in any other game

814
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,840
today. Like it doesn't bother me in Mario three d land. It only bothers me in Mario

815
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:04,080
Kart. But I was thinking if I had kind of the extension that that circle pad provides

816
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,560
that there's a more, more rest for my thumb there and it might work better, but I'm not

817
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,720
buying it this way. I guess I could import one, but I don't like that idea either. To

818
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,640
be honest, I guess I'm just going to have to wait for the three ds redesign that will

819
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,600
release the three ds they probably should have put out in the first place. Yeah, they'll

820
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:28,080
do a three ds redesign, but here's the thing I, and I suggested this on Twitter. Um, it's

821
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,600
a peripheral. There'll be third party solutions for it and there'll be probably third party

822
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:37,760
solutions. They're even better than it, you know, the official Nintendo one. So just wait

823
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,640
to wait to get it. I mean, um, there's no reason you need to rush out and do it. And

824
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,240
honestly, you know, before we were like saying, Oh, maybe the reason that GameStop has the

825
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:56,760
exclusive on, you know, Xenoblade is because, um, they may have helped to pay for the import

826
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:03,160
stuff, but for the circle pad, ah, I don't think so. I think that it's just, I don't

827
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:11,520
know, unless I was part of the Xenoblade stuff. Yeah, so I'm not happy about the whole thing,

828
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,760
but I don't know what, I don't know what Nintendo has to gain from this, to be honest, by being

829
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,000
in bed with GameStop so much. But here's the only thing I can think of. I hate that this

830
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,680
is a pattern. That they think that this is going to be a niche product and that they

831
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,200
don't want to save money. They're going to ship everything to one, one source, basically

832
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:38,640
GameStop, you know, cause they do this in distribution, um, all the time or even their

833
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,940
direct retail partners is that these companies will, to save money, they will drop retail

834
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:50,680
partners and make them go through distribution, um, to, you know, drop the amount of locations

835
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:56,200
to save on freight and just streamline everything so they don't have to ship to all these different

836
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,580
locations. They ship to five locations instead and let them sort it out from there. So maybe

837
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,840
that's what they're doing with this because they're thinking that they're just not going

838
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:10,240
to sell a lot of it. And yeah, I think they're right. They're not going to sell a lot of

839
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,440
it because it's not a peripheral that's absolutely needed for some stuff, but it's nice. But

840
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,880
once again, I mean, come on, this totally screams that they're going to do a revision

841
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,720
of this thing. Yeah, no, I, and I can kind of see where you're going with that. It is

842
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,440
a bit of a niche thing and, and you know, the developers are kind of in a, in a stuck

843
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:34,000
place. They can't really design games to require this, especially now, you know, like I think

844
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
ever if they're not going to be able to, well, hold on though, because the new Zelda game

845
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,400
requires Wii motion plus, which really wasn't a part of the week when they do a redesign

846
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,920
of the 3ds. Eventually I think they could start to require it kind of down the line,

847
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,000
but I don't think they could, it's going to be a good year or two. I mean, that's how

848
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
long games take to develop anyway. It's going to be a good year or two before that's required.

849
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,120
I think if they're going to start doing games that require stuff, they better do it sooner

850
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,120
than later because they want, you know, the least amount of consoles to be affected by

851
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:07,640
it. All right, well let's move on to Dark Sakura with some news. There's news. It exists

852
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:19,200
and this one is about Square Enix. The Square Enix members site actually was shut down and

853
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,040
according to Square Enix, they said that they were actually looking to see exactly how deep

854
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:30,640
the breach goes. It looks like it was indeed hacked. So they said that it was a server

855
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,360
that was used by members in the US and Japan and so they shut down the server so that they

856
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:40,960
can see exactly what's gone on. They said they can't confirm that there's any possibility

857
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:47,060
of credit card information leak since that server that was hacked doesn't contain any

858
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,160
credit card information. But they're going to look through it and double check everybody.

859
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:58,520
So if you were on there, your credit card's safe. If not, ain't your problem. So there's

860
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:07,600
that. At least it's not your Xbox getting hacked. At least nothing was taken. But once

861
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,960
again though, if you have your email associated with that Square Enix account that may also

862
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:20,240
be associated with a console or you may share a password on that site that you also share

863
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:29,280
on your console, you may think about changing that just to be on the safe side.

864
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,800
So there's been a lot of lawsuits against Sony for different things. One of the more

865
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:41,640
popular ones is the other OS removal and there was a class action lawsuit actually with Sony

866
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:53,160
about that. A federal judge has dismissed all counts of the suit. It's interesting though.

867
01:10:53,160 --> 01:11:00,960
All of the claims have been dismissed I guess back in February. But I guess they amended

868
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:08,640
their claims and of course they dismissed the amended claims as well. The quote they

869
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:16,120
have from I guess Judge Richard Seaborg is in light of the prior amendment and the fundamental

870
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,400
shortcomings in the plaintiff's basic theory that it was wrongful for Sony to release the

871
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:29,720
software update in dispute, leave to amend will be denied. So they're not allowing them

872
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:44,320
to amend it again and they're basically dismissing it. So basically they allowed the people to

873
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:52,280
keep the other OS but they obviously had to decline the update and basically it was well

874
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,440
within Sony's rights to do that whether you like it or not. I think that's part of the

875
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,560
reason why you can use your license agreement so they can do that kind of stuff. You know

876
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,200
it's not what we were saying. And technically you know it wasn't an advertised feature on

877
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,680
the box even though it was something that they talked about and you know different developer

878
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:16,760
conferences and E3 and stuff like that. You mean the little fine notes there but it wasn't

879
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:22,460
something that they go hey you can run Linux on this because I mean but then again Linux

880
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,640
on anything anyway. Then again though you can still kind of run Linux on it if you know

881
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,600
you jailbreak it and give it an amount of time or some more time and jailbreaking will

882
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,800
probably be legal soon enough and then you can do what you want. But once again they

883
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:45,680
can also you know prevent you from playing online if they have that ability. Although

884
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:50,640
I mean if you think about it it's not only does you know the other OS thing doesn't necessarily

885
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,320
just stop you from playing online it stops you from playing new games because new games

886
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,280
require firmware updates that are included on the disk and those updates remove other

887
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:10,040
OS so it kind of sucks. Damned if you do damned if you don't. I mean just maybe maybe buy

888
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:16,760
a computer that do Linux instead of actually using you know your PlayStation 3 unless you're

889
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,280
the military and then you can buy a whole bunch of them just specifically for that but

890
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,600
it's just either going to be a computer or a game console. They're busy curing cancer

891
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:34,920
below their game. You can still do the folding at home without having the other OS stuff.

892
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,720
I never used the other OS. I thought about it for a while but just never got around to

893
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:44,720
it. I have a laptop with Linux on it. What do I need that for on my. Yeah I don't I think

894
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:50,960
if people are just looking for a reason to have their panties in a bunch. Yeah. So real

895
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,960
quick let's talk a little bit. Yeah I'm sure we're kind of talked about this during kind

896
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,800
of what we're playing this week. But yes in case you haven't heard and you happen to have

897
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:10,260
bought a 3DS early on you're one of the early adopters if you will. You are of course going

898
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:16,280
to get some more games as part of the ambassadors program. You'll be getting 10 free Gameboy

899
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,120
Advance games as well and this is kind of cool. Some actually really good games in there

900
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:27,120
which I was very pleasantly surprised to see. They include Super Mario Advance 3 Yoshi's

901
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:34,600
Island, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Metroid Fusion, WarioWare Mega Micro Games, Mario

902
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:40,080
vs Donkey Kong, Wario Land 4, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, The Sacred Stones,

903
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,140
The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, and F-Zero Maximum Velocity. Some of those games actually

904
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,880
I recently sold with one of my old DS's. I gotta say some of those games haven't aged

905
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,760
too well either. Because I played the Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero which I love

906
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:01,400
the F-Zero on the GameCube but yeah the F-Zero on Gameboy Advance I guess wasn't that good

907
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,240
or one of those things you kind of remember more fondly 10 years ago. These games aren't

908
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,080
that old but still they're kind of showing their age a little bit. Especially the Mario

909
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,960
Kart. Like it's hard to go from playing Mario Kart 7 on your 3DS to going to play Mario

910
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,680
Kart Super Circuit because it's like why am I not able to get the nitro boost when I do

911
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,200
the turn or you know some of that. So it controls really funky too compared to 7. And I gotta

912
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:27,360
say Mario Kart 7 man that's a good looking game. I mean the screenshots don't do it justice

913
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,680
at all or even the gameplay video doesn't do it justice. But man it's just really crisp.

914
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:40,520
But some of the other like Gameboy Advance like Metroid is great. WarioWare is amazing.

915
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,360
You know there's a lot of great. You know the best. Even though it's not in the bundle

916
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,000
it's still the best. River City Ransom. What on Gameboy Advance? That's right. Heck yeah

917
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,980
it was really good. But that's not a first party Nintendo game. That's the one thing

918
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,460
all these games have in common. No but I'm saying that it's a game that has aged well.

919
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,100
And hello Yoshi's Super Mario 2 Yoshi's Island which yes I realize is whatever they redid

920
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,600
it as for the Gameboy Advance but still that's an amazing game. And then also one thing I

921
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,600
read is kind of a little tip because I know the Gameboy Advance stuff gets stretched out

922
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,380
when you play it. You can actually hold start or select while you're starting the game up

923
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,660
and it will shrink it down. Yeah funny enough Kijuno in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com

924
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,800
says Rob did you play the Gameboy Advance games in small window mode? Yeah I actually

925
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,920
didn't like it. I just I didn't mind the stretched images. Especially for like WarioWare. It

926
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,220
doesn't matter. Those games weren't like cutting edge graphics. But I can see where the stretch

927
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,400
gets kind of yucky on some of the other games. So I get why you can do that. But it's too

928
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,120
small. Windows too small when you do it that way. Zether in our chatroom is saying you

929
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,780
know the Gameboy Advance F-Zero is more of a throwback to the SNES games. I thought the

930
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,600
SNES games control better. I will say though it is interesting to play those games with

931
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,520
the circle pad. Because it works. I mean you know. But we didn't have like a circle pad

932
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:00,560
on the Gameboy Advance so it's kind of neat to have that. Yeah. So. Alright. Alright Dark

933
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,120
Sakura what do you have for us? Well I have some more stuff. This actually has to do with

934
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:14,760
Ultima Online 2. There was apparently something said by Richard Garriott who was looking to

935
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,460
talk to EA about publishing a new Ultima Online. He said that they would they would love to

936
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:28,800
have access to the Ultima property and had discussions with EA about it. But EA apparently

937
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,960
is not down for that. They've said no we're not. What's he talking about? In fact the

938
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,040
quote actually says I'm not sure what Richard Garriott is referring to. So it doesn't look

939
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:45,000
like that might actually be happening. Maybe he's feeling a little bit sorrowful that you

940
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,120
know Tabula Rasa didn't work out the space thing. Maybe. Not really doing that now but.

941
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:57,760
But there is something about an Ultimate Collector project that does start with Ultima. Hmm.

942
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:04,400
Maybe no. Ultima was a great series though. I would like to see it make a comeback in

943
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,560
some form or another. I know they have the web game I think was the last big thing I

944
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,280
saw them doing. But some people are still freaking playing Ultima Online. They gave

945
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,000
it they gave it a big redesign a few years ago to kind of make it a little more current.

946
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,960
So it's kind of cool. Let's see. Alright let's travel around the world and look at some release

947
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,920
dates and check out what's coming out to an arcade or excuse me a home console. I wish

948
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:32,400
it was a tradition arcade but to a console near you soon. Well probably not a lot right.

949
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,400
Yeah. I hope you like Star Wars The Old Republic because that's all that's coming out this

950
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:47,760
week on PC. Nice. That's it. Alright. It's pretty good. Let's go to Japan and check out

951
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,280
what's coming out there. Now I do want to point out the Vita is out in Japan. That was

952
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,080
one of the big releases of this past week. And of course you see a lot of the unboxing videos

953
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,400
and a lot of stuff. I thought about importing it until I saw the six hundred dollar for

954
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:06,640
just the console thing. Oh my God. Like a hundred bucks each. No thank you. All right.

955
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,120
Things are a little more exciting in Japan than just one game this week on the Xbox 360

956
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,720
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 gets a dubbed version for Japanese release this week. Divinity

957
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:22,960
2 The Dragon Knight Saga and Musou Orochi 2 comes in a regular and treasure box edition

958
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,920
from Koei Tecmo comes out this week on the Xbox 360. That's a is this a fighting game.

959
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,440
I think this is a fighting series. Oh yeah it's a fighting series from Koei. It's probably

960
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:41,840
like a Dynasty Warriors universe fighter. Orochi has to do with a legend an old legend.

961
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:49,680
What was that was it Orochi? Yeah. Musou. Yeah. I think it might be all that stuff.

962
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,400
On the PlayStation 3 pretty much the same games I just mentioned Modern Warfare 3 Musou Orochi 2

963
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:05,360
a couple extra games there though. Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011. Need for Speed Hot

964
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,080
Pursuit gets a price reduction and next week in Japan I got to get this out there because we're

965
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:17,280
not going to be here next week. The Idolmaster Graver For You Volume 3 comes out next week. I

966
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,720
know The Idolmaster is like a really big series over in Japan. Going to some of the other consoles

967
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:29,520
I want to check out at least like the Wii and the Vita. Nothing really on the Wii that I can see.

968
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,800
Oh wait I was looking at the Wii U no wonder I don't see anything there. My name my brain

969
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:42,720
combined them into the WETA. On the Wii Inazuma Eleven Strikers 2012 Extreme. That's the lone

970
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:48,480
Wii release this week and let's see if there's anything on the 3DS or the Vita. Any late starts

971
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,000
out the gate. Oh yeah Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3. Oh that's a general Asia region release

972
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:02,880
comes out this week and quickly let me look on the 3DS. There is a looks like there's a branded

973
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:09,520
Nintendo 3S a Gundam 3DS. Oh no the SD card it's just the SD cards. Oh no no this is the full 3DS.

974
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,400
Are they SD Gundam cards? Yeah yeah like they're SD cards little Gundam characters and then they

975
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:20,880
actually have a 3DS that has. That makes it funny because they're SD Gundams. It was a series SD

976
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:28,000
Gundam. I gotcha. Well there is a game also to go with it SD Gundam G generation 3D is out this week.

977
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:35,040
SD Gundams are so cute. All right there you go that's your Japanese releases. The UK um on the 20th

978
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:41,760
Star Wars The Old Republic um and the 21st Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD on PS3. That's it.

979
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,720
Pretty quick series of release dates yep. That's what happens this time of year. All right Loki.

01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:03,200

991
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:13,520
coming out for the 3DS. Um on uh WiiWare La Mulana is supposed to be coming out. That's pretty cool.

992
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,520
And then uh someone tell DT to keep it in his pants. Yeah he's already well aware of La Mulana

993
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:27,280
coming out. Nice. He's he's on the pulse of La Mulana. Um Rhythm Heaven Fever that's coming out

February 13th on the Wii. That's also going to be $29.99. So uh you're a nice budget price for that

995
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:41,040
honestly never got into those. But uh and then of course the Circle Pad Pro will be coming out

996
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:46,080
around that time. All right well before we get to the classic game of the week I gotta share this

997
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,320
story that's going around the internet this week making its way on the gaming blogs. Uh a very

998
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:55,680
interesting censorship issue going on on the Nintendo 3DS. Imagine if you were Ashton Kutcher

999
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:04,080
and you tried to name your Mii on your 3DS Ashton. Uh Nintendo apparently is censoring that name

1000
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:10,240
believing that it contains objectionable content. Because think about it Ashton if you spell it out

1001
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:17,600
A S H. Yeah it sounds like a shit ton or um ass ton maybe. I don't know but this. So if you like

1002
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,160
Aston Martin's you can't have one? I guess not. So this poor guy named Ashton I mean it's not

1003
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,320
Ashton Kutcher obviously but that's you know a common use of the name or we would think like

1004
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,440
oh there are people named this in the world. Because if it was Ashton Kutcher that shit would

1005
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:38,000
be fixed. Maybe done. But somebody who also has the name Ashton uh tried to set up he named his

1006
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,560
Mii that and he named his um uh the Mii creator that and it got censored. And he actually shows

1007
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,120
there's a whole YouTube video and you can see the YouTube for yourself it's posted there. Uh

1008
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:57,360
it is on user L E Y V I U R. Leave your? Take it or leave your? Uh so you can see this and he

1009
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,440
actually shows his Mii and then he shows what it looks like on his friend's system where it's

1010
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,720
replaced it with a bunch of question marks because apparently the name Ashton is objectionable. Now

1011
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,800
Ashton Kutcher I find objectionable but this poor guy who just happens to have the same name

1012
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:18,240
shouldn't have to suffer the consequence of Ashton Kutcher being crappy. So.

1013
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,240
Man wouldn't you hate to find out that Nintendo just suddenly deemed your name offensive?

1014
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:29,920
It's stupid. I'm offended by Rob. Yeah I feel like you're gonna steal from me. It's like you're

1015
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:36,560
gonna rob a bank or something. Hey well it's good though that they was it for the 3DS they've

1016
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:44,400
patched it so that they can add DLC right? So does that mean they're gonna be able to bug fix stuff

1017
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,920
like this? Well I suppose they could get firmware updates. They could do that in a firmware update.

1018
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,080
That firmware update really did kind of you know it was like they changed everything in that

1019
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:57,440
console. I mean they they overwrote some of the stuff in the the find me thing. They overwrote

1020
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,560
it was a lot of changes so they can they could they could fix it if they want. I know they can.

1021
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:09,040
But they're not. No not unless Ashton Kutcher tweets about it. So somebody should send him

1022
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,440
that YouTube. But they could do it though because remember there's issues with Street Fighter where

1023
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,760
it wasn't working correctly or Ridge Racer or something like that. One of the launch titles

1024
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:27,200
was like bugged or something. Yeah so they fixed that. It's sad that you know because we're gonna

1025
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:34,080
get into a story later on but it's sad that that Nintendo hasn't embraced the ability to

1026
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:44,160
patch games. Right? Stupid. Yeah all right let's uh let's take a look at the classic game of the

1027
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:52,000
week. I thought of it in my car. Every week we take a stroll down memory lane because you know

1028
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,280
at one one day you didn't have these 3DSs that were banning people's names. You used to just

1029
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,760
one day actually in tonight's case you used to walk into an arcade and there actually were

1030
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:10,240
arcade games there and not like machines that spat tickets out. Right. So you have to recognize

1031
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:14,160
the classic games in the past the way things used to be. You better recognize. You better recognize or

1032
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:19,680
a recognizer will force you to play games. All right so you have to play Space Paranoids over

1033
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,880
and over. Dark Soccer enough set up. What is tonight's classic game of the week? Xavius.

1034
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,960
It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Namco and it came out in 1982. You know what else came out in

1035
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:41,840
1982 Rob? What? Tron. Awesome. Yeah it was a game done by Masanobu Endo and uh it was released by

1036
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:48,080
Atari in the US and it runs on the Galaga hardware. But I just have to say I find the um background

1037
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,640
music on this to actually get kind of annoying. I might have to kill it at some point. The um in

1038
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,480
Brazil the cabinet actually says Colombia for the game but the software still says Xavius.

1039
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:06,160
So um you use um an uh eight directional joystick to move an aircraft called the Silvelo which has

1040
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:11,920
a forward firing zapper and a blaster that lets you send the air to surface bombs down for ground

1041
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:19,440
targets. And it's supposed to be set in Peru. So you have to basically just fly around and shoot

1042
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:28,880
shit. It's a shmup. You have 16 areas and it loops back to area 7 after 16 and uh you just keep going

1043
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:37,360
over terrain and shooting shit. So if you complete at least 70% of the area before dying then um like

1044
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:43,200
when you die then you actually will start at the next level instead. It constantly flies forward

1045
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:49,680
just like any good shmup. Um you actually can make it through the whole game without killing anybody

1046
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:56,400
for the record. Although not really. Where's the fun in that? I know right? The challenge is not

1047
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:04,720
getting hit. Um it is one of the very I would have to put it in the first of the uh uh shmups.

1048
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:11,920
It actually one of an earlier one before that was Caverns of Mars on uh the uh Atari computer.

1049
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:20,240
Um it was really really cool. It uses a lot of different um uh techniques for it. It uses palette

1050
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:30,640
shifting for color changes and it's just really amazing. Um they also had a uh a few hidden bonuses

1051
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:35,920
in it that you could find by doing a secret maneuver. Um one of them was a special flag from

1052
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:42,640
Rally X. And what happens if you find the flag then you um get an extra life. It's in a bunch of

1053
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:52,160
Namco games. Um and the slogan when this came out was are you devious enough to play Xevious?

1054
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:58,320
Oh and then it says the arcade game you can't play at home. I'm gonna play some of the music from the

1055
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:06,320
I'm gonna play some of the music from the um the the newer the newer one. Well

1056
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:15,360
actually there were um pretty big uh music stars in Japan who were big fans of the games. And uh

1057
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:24,240
one of them who was Keisuke Kawata um of Southern All-Stars actually did an album uh that was all

1058
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:32,080
based off of Namco video games and Xevious was the centerpiece one. And then um there was also

1059
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:38,720
a 12-inch single that had uh liner notes and a science fiction story written by um the creator

1060
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:45,920
um Masa no Blendo uh that had uh it was set in the world of Xevious and had its own language

1061
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:55,520
included. Um there was also a three-part novel written about it called uh Fairdraw F-A-R-D-R-A-U-T

1062
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,520
um but the theory is that it doesn't sound like it was ever released or if it was released it

1063
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:07,200
was really limited release. There were other games that came out in the series. In 84 it was Super

1064
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:16,160
Xevious that was basically the same game just harder and uh Sylvilo in 1991 which was first

1065
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:22,880
person sort of it uses 3D flat shaded polygons and they only came out in Japan. Xevious 3D-G um

1066
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:30,960
in 1995 was basically a 3D textured um on top of polygons and two-player play only in Japan although

1067
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:38,000
I've seen one. Xevious Arrangement in 1995 that was part of the Namco Classic Volume 1 collection

1068
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,480
also included Xevious and Super Xevious. Um Grubda which was a spin-off starring an enemy

1069
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:52,320
a tank with corkscrew treads that came out in 84. Also um new versions for the home system was

1070
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:58,880
Super Veevious Gamp no Nazo in 1986 which came out for uh the Famicom and the Nintendo Vs.

1071
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:06,720
I'm sorry why is that versus series um in the arcades. Uh basically there's different riddles

1072
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:12,480
you have to solve to get through it. Um there was Xevious Fardrop Saga which was um an MSX2 game

1073
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,680
and it was done by Compile. Compile does amazing stuff. You can actually uh pick from four

1074
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,720
different ships you have the Sylvilo, the Solgrado, the Zeodally and the Gamp Mission.

1075
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:29,760
There's uh Xevious Fardrop Densetsu in 1990 that came out on PC Engine also done by Compile.

1076
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:36,800
And then Xevious Resurrection that came out in 2009 for PS3 as a downloadable um with the

1077
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:43,920
downloadable title Namco Museum Essentials or it was called namcomuseum.com to the ends in Japan.

1078
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,880
There's also an RTS game called New Space Order that was done by Namco Bandai Games

1079
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:54,800
that has bits of Xevious included in it. For different ports we're looking at the Atari 7800

1080
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:03,360
Atari um 8-bit NEC PC Engine, the NES, the MSX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II,

1081
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:09,840
Apple ST Home Computer. Everything. Yep. Rereleases like I said there was Namco Museum Volume 2 for

1082
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:19,040
the Playstation which I have the A. Um the Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade PC 1998, Namco Museum 50th

1083
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:24,720
Anniversary for Xbox, PS2, GameCube. That one's pretty sweet actually. I like that one. And PC.

1084
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:33,040
Um it was not in the Game Boy Advance version by the way. Uh Namco Museum Battle Collection for PSP,

1085
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:39,200
Namco Museum DS, Namco Museum Remix on Wii, Namco Museum Essentials for PS3. Like I said earlier

1086
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:46,640
and it was also ported into the plug-and-play um version of Ms. Pac-Man TV compilation for a little

1087
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:58,720
plug-in thing. Um there was also um a uh GBA um release of the NES version on um it was an

1088
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:04,960
unlockable bonus game for Star Fox Assault and then came out on Virtual Console. Uh like I said

1089
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:10,080
there's just a bunch of them. They tried to do a 2600 version it didn't come out. It was part of

1090
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:18,800
Pac-Man's arcade party in 2010 and uh 3D classic Xevious a 3D uh remake of the game was available

1091
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:27,040
on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS. There's a bootleg version too called Xevious. X-E-V-I-O-S.

1092
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:37,440
The U is absent. Oh that makes it a new game. Um but really it's just all they did was instead of

1093
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:50,080
saying uh 1982 Namco it says 1980 Watson and they removed the Namco logo and it's just not very cool.

1094
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:59,280
In fact um there's a trick that was in Xevious um that the bootlegger left in that you um get

1095
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,600
a message right at the beginning. When the ship appears you move to the far right edge of the

1096
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,800
screen and begin bombing constantly. You keep bombing until the first set of attack rings is

1097
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,560
close to you then you shoot the rings. The message dead copy making copy under Namco program will

1098
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:20,080
appear on the screen as proof of copyright validation and the explosion sounds are different.

1099
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,680
As far as differences in the U.S. and Japanese ones um the names in the Japanese version are

1100
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:32,960
the pseudonyms of the games designers and composers and since uh the U.S. basically let three uh

1101
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:38,000
characters in it didn't work and the zapper and blaster buttons were reversed between the versions.

1102
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,120
There's also references in Ridge Racer you get a car called the um RTXevious Red and the RTXevious

1103
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:52,320
Green uh you get that all three different versions of it and uh one of the in Ridge Racer 3D one of

1104
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:58,400
the unlockable cars is called the Sovalo and it's piloted by Pac-Man. Isn't that cool? Very cool.

1105
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:03,760
How about other references? Good lord there's a lot to this game. Oh yeah we're we're just scratching

1106
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,360
we're just scratching the surface in Star Fox. Come on we're getting ready to start Mario Kart. In Star Fox

1107
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:16,960
Assault it's uh it has basically hidden versions in it. Tales of Symphonia there's an enemy called

1108
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:23,600
Bakura which is one of the invisible flying panels from Xevious. Mario Kart Arcade GP and GP2 which

1109
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:33,200
were co-developed by Namco. Um you also uh one of Pac-Man's uh cars is the Sovalo spacecraft.

1110
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:41,200
In Earthbound music from Xevious can be heard um at the Onet Arcade. Um you can actually get

1111
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:48,320
the Sovalo ship um as an avatar on PSN and it will be a downloadable aircraft in Ace Combat

1112
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:56,960
Assault Horizon. There you go. Your classic game of the week Xevious and its 50 gazillion different

1113
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:02,320
ports and reiterations. I like this one I'm looking I've never played this one the 3D-G.

1114
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,800
Yeah I never played that one but it looks kind of fun I gotta say. You know what when I told um Dan

1115
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:12,240
what I picked he's like Xevious is awesome. It is awesome. The other game that I picked though he

1116
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:19,600
was really excited about that so I might have to do it uh next time. All right well uh we're gonna

1117
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,920
take a break we're gonna do Mario Kart again we are uh getting in the oil army room right now

1118
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,920
there's already five of us in there including myself and Loki and Bobby Black Wolf so it's

1119
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:34,560
really it's on it's kind of and Tiger Claw so it's really like All Games versus Zether who won

1120
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:41,040
last time so it's not looking good. Everyone's got a team All Games has each other's back dude

1121
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,440
you are in trouble. That's right you are screwed. They're gonna use a special turtle shell that just

1122
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,600
breaks out of paddle and spanks you. Does Zether have a shell maybe he does and I just I'm not

1123
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,000
aware who knows. All right anyhow uh so if you have Mario Kart 7 hurry up and get in there in

1124
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:03,760
the oil army room quickly write this down get a pen start punching it in 40-5530-8176-7193

1125
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:08,240
that's the oil army Mario Kart 7 code. All right we're about to get started. We'll let you know

1126
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:12,480
how it goes after a quick break well we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1129
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:36,480
he won both races so in Zether versus All Games Zether won so good job dude uh and uh I came in

1130
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:44,560
third both times Loki came in last on both races good job Loki yeah it's because a fucking blue

1173
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,480
the humble indie bundle there's the there's another one the really big bundle or something

1174
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:22,160
like that i bought that one too this is a great trend in gaming right now and then um you know

1175
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:27,680
there was a game called apb it was kind of like saints row online um or granted that online if

1176
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:34,320
you will but anyways apb uh it went freemium and now apparently they've been having some pretty

1177
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:42,320
good success over steam and they're also going to release it as a um a box version that you can find

1178
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:50,160
in retailers uh for 29.99 you're gonna get more than 50 worth of in-game items um as well and um

1179
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,920
it's pretty awesome i guess the original game only had 130 000 registered players but they've

1180
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:03,520
already um you know picked up more than the original audience so that's that's pretty awesome

1181
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:08,720
because a lot of people wrote that game off yeah they picked up three million new registered users

1182
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:14,160
wow three million after showing up on steam and you know from what i played very little of it uh

1183
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:20,640
it's pretty cool i mean it's worth checking out because it's free so why not all right uh let's

1184
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,000
go to some other news you know harmonix put out a new game this year but you might have missed it

1185
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,320
because it wasn't called rock band but it was a fun little iphone game called vid rid vid rhythm

1186
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,960
i guess you can't really call it a game it was more of a wtf it was an application and it was

1187
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,000
like get drunk at a party and have fun making these little vid rhythm well if you want to try

1188
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,240
vid rhythm the good news is it's now free if you missed it the first time around check go get it

1189
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:48,080
it's free now with 12 new tracks and a vid rhythm update 1.1 that happened this week there are some

1190
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:53,920
holiday songs deck the halls jingle bells and apparently pitch correction now so now you can

1191
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,160
sound like t-pain i don't know exactly how that works six new video styles in there as well and

1192
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:02,160
and one more you can export the clips in high definition now so vid of them had a pretty

1193
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,160
meaty update this week very cool seeing harmonix support it even though it's more of a

1194
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:12,080
wtf kind of application to be honest holy shit what are you holy shitting vid rhythm no a picture

1195
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:19,200
of me when i was 20 that one of my friends just posted wow on facebook on facebook look at my hair

1196
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:28,160
it was long sorry i just like wow you had you used to have pretty big boobies back then

1197
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,280
i've always had an epic rack rob what are you talking about

1198
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:38,160
you know what's gonna suck is if i do get all knocked up they're just gonna get bigger it's

1199
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:42,640
true you know zether might have the biggest mario kart e-peen but you'll always have the biggest

1200
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:50,880
hits i do have an epic rack it's not a bad thing all right uh allen wake is coming to pcs in early

1201
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:58,080
2012 uh even though the game's been on xbox for quite some time about a little over a year year

1202
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,680
and a half uh allen wake is supposed to be coming out on the pc finally in early 2012 which is

1203
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:05,760
interesting because uh i thought the game was originally supposed to be on both and then they

1204
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,880
said no it's not going to be on the pc well now it is actually coming on the pc both download

1205
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:16,240
content the rider and the signal they're going to be included in the pc version for free possibly to

1206
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,120
make up for a little bit of lost time uh interestingly enough this is time to be right

1207
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:25,920
around the time that the allen wake xbox live arcade game or allen wakes american nightmare

1208
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,840
is supposed to be coming out on xbox live arcade so kind of maybe trying to get the name out there

1209
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,000
a little bit again before the xbox live arcade expansion uh connectimals i find this interesting

1210
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,560
you know this is one of the big titles on connect well connectimals has come out on another platform

1211
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:48,320
on another platform it's coming out on ios i think that's i think this is very interesting um maybe

1212
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:52,800
something we should talk about in a more extended segment but uh connectimals is coming out on the

1213
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:59,360
ios platforms this is just a port of the windows phone 7 version but it still goes without saying

1214
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:05,200
hey microsoft didn't just put out the xbox live application on ios this is now extending to some

1215
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:11,680
of the games and sure connectimals is meh whatever but for two dollars and ninety nine cents you can

1216
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:18,000
now i get this and it comes with i guess five cubs for the 360 games i guess you gotta link them

1217
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:24,160
together somehow or whatever so very interesting also you know why i think this is interesting is

1218
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:28,720
because there's been a lot of calls for nintendo to do something like this right the investors

1219
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:33,760
really want nintendo to be doing this and they've really staunchly refused but microsoft has now

1220
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,320
shown that they're not afraid to do it now granted they get a little more out of it with the whole

1221
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:44,080
windows phone tie in but i mean they put it out there it's kind of like they acknowledged hey

1222
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:48,160
if we don't put that on ios too we're selling ourselves short a little bit they kind of gave

1223
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:53,200
windows phone an exclusive window they put it out there first but they kind of gave in and did the

1224
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:59,040
ios system i just it's not like microsoft and apple doing things together is completely unheard

1225
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:04,000
of right remember the gasps heard around the world when microsoft word was announced for the

1226
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,040
max that was years and years ago when steve jobs first came back to apple but um it's still

1227
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:13,040
interesting nonetheless very interesting to see this happening be curious to see if sony or

1228
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:19,440
nintendo ever does anything in a similar vein anyhow moving on dark sakura wow i found pictures

1229
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:25,200
of me when i was four okay oh i was a cute kid damn it it's still cute what happened

1230
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:33,280

1253
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,600
game olr uh a little later in the show first off though loki you know i was gonna mention uh

1254
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:10,320
remember earlier i said that i don't like people sending me invites or i'm not gonna accept any

1255
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:16,160
invites that people send me for the sim social when the fuck this in aol instant messenger start

1256
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:21,280
like posting on your fucking facebook wall saying i've been idle since blah blah blah time

1257
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:27,360
blah blah time i don't fucking care if you haven't been doing something in another app so hide all

1258
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:32,880
that i hate that it's posting like what's news articles my friends are reading i'm kind of like

1259
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:38,160
on yahoo my friends know that i can tell like that they're reading all these weird stories like

1260
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,280
maybe they're reading a few too many stories about lindsey low hand you know and i'm kind

1261
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,360
of judging them a little bit well i i want to make sure that shit's not happening just

1262
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:49,040
acts like you don't realize it's happening you know what i mean you got to be careful uh go

1263
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,960
through every now and then and check like what apps have access honestly it's what you got to do

1264
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:58,800
yeah all right um anyways so let's talk a little bit about uh club nintendo and this is kind of

1265
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:04,240
cool because actually i've never really registered stuff in club nintendo and i started yesterday so

1266
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:08,640
i had a bunch of these old games i just went back through you know like excite bots and shit like

1267
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:15,120
that so i just added almost everything although i can't find my box for my 3ds um and definitely

1268
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:19,760
don't have anything well the we would have been too early but don't have my 3ds box which is kind

1269
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:25,600
of sad because i'm missing some points there might be a work but um you can use those points for

1270
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:31,680
other things other than buying useless garbage that they have on their e-shop stuff um hold on

1271
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:36,080
there's necessarily e-shop but you know the free shit they give away i don't really need a mario

1272
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:43,040
notepad or something like that but uh you can buy uh games virtual console and we wear and e-shop

1273
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:51,840
games including uh this first round of games all um either 100 or 150 coins for 100 coins on the

1274
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:57,600
we you can get mario super mario kart on virtual console and this is only good until january 10th

1275
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:04,480
so if you want to use that then go ahead and do that if you don't have the game um for the uh we

1276
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:14,480
wear you have fluosity and uh that's 150 coins on the 3ds or ds i believe it's a 3ds you have um

1277
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:25,600
the 3d classic xevious for 100 coins or mario versus donkey kong minis march again for 150 coins

1278
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:34,720
and um it's neat but yeah there's not really i was kind of disappointed at the rewards it's

1279
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,080
an interesting way to get you to spend some of those coins well you know like you can get some

1280
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:44,400
pretty meaty things for more coins like there's the game and watch ds game and we we got a statue

1281
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:49,760
yeah from club nintendo did you that's um like all the major mario characters that's cool

1282
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:53,360
and the little statue i don't think my level is high enough to get any of the really cool rewards

1283
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,360
but i've been trying to put like i put in my code for the to have in 3ds and getting the two games

1284
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:04,000
i got because i i thought i heard something about the kid icarus 3d will be free if you register two

1285
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,520
games on club nintendo this winner well i've already done that so yeah me too so i want to

1286
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,760
make sure i would get that between mario kart 7 and and the mario kart 3d land so i'm kind of

1287
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,440
disappointed though that you can't and and here's the other thing i don't like about the registering

1288
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:21,520
the games yeah it's cool that we register the games but i don't like fucking filling out that

1289
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:25,840
survey yeah it's kind of like especially you should notice how you get a damn survey for

1290
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:30,080
each and every like stinking like nes game and probably now the game boy advance games are all

1291
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:34,640
gonna have a survey on there too i kind of think it's no i i haven't seen surveys for any nes games

1292
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:38,240
they want to make sure that they're still releasing stuff of good quality so do you get

1293
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:43,200
coins for buying like stuff on the e-shop um yeah if you do the survey on them i think you do i

1294
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,280
didn't have any surveys well i haven't purchased anything on the e-shop yeah check it out once you

1295
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:52,160
do i think i think they do get get some stuff there so it'll be cool i got surveys for the free

1296
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:58,800
shit by the way the information is up on our tumblr now the link to the uh pokemon plus

1297
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,600
nobunaga's ambition i love that jigglypuff's on the cover like she's gonna sing the armies to

1298
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:10,480
sleep what is okay what is looking like to me okay from what i can tell is that every human

1299
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:16,080
character has a pokemon partner i guess they're doing like digimon like this one guy in purple

1300
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:22,960
armor has a mewtwo and the girl she's all in pink she has jigglypuff and this one's got okay so you

1301
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:28,240
see and then i think whoever he is is the guy catching them i'd be more interested in the dynasty

1302
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:35,440
warriors mario crossover fucking we need to know armies of goombas with you know we need to do a

1303
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,400
list list so i didn't schedule one tonight because i knew we had the interview it would take about

1304
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,520
a bunch of time but we need to do list list some night like crossover emotions yeah i feel like

1305
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,000
we've done that before random japanese crime it has to be japanese franchise random ass japanese

1306
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
crossover game we want to see i think that would be a good one dude we have time for that anyway

1307
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,200
no not tonight we still had you after birth and all that so we're that interview was 20 minutes so

1308
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:03,280
anyhow um moving on that was 20 minutes shut up shut up well uh you'll lose a lot more than 20

1309
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:08,080
minutes if you hit this bug here um did you hear about this there's that zelda skyward sword

1310
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:14,080
apparently you could catch yourself in some type of like error where if you complete a quest in

1311
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,760
the wrong order and then talk to a guy you can like screw things up i don't know but apparently

1312
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:25,280
nintendo on the support page for legend of zelda skyward sword says you can actually send in your

1313
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:31,840
save file to be fixed nintendo apparently will also be putting out a program that will repair

1314
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,520
the save data if you have your we connected to the internet so it's like a patch but not really

1315
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:41,440
so yeah i guess you could catch yourself in some type of because they can't patch

1316
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:46,880
yeah they can't patch but they're going to put out some type of fix so there you go you could

1317
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,920
also you could send in your safe you could send in your we and get your game fixed fuck if you

1318
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:59,200
screwed up so just i would read the internet and figure out what you need to do to not screw it up

1319
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,200
or don't try to break the game because i think you kind of have to go backwards a little bit

1320
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,960
to make this happen so i don't know all right we're going to now see if anybody can break our

1321
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:15,920
mailbag mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is the place to send us emails every week

1322
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:23,760
dark soccer read some emails we have two two yeah that's a pathetic showing of emails well

1323
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:29,040
one's from rob all right well he's pretty cool he says i got my answer from the consumer protection

1324
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:34,720
um they said they can't give legal advice even though they are under an attorney general's

1325
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:39,200
office then again i didn't ask for legal advice simply information their answer seems to say that

1326
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:45,600
this is not codified in law in maryland my advice for these nasty eulas is if you feel the need to

1327
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:51,200
sue microsoft or sony is to first try the arbitration then dispute it if the settlement

1328
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:58,080
is unfair i think you just got a form letter back dude that's the form letter okay last email

1329
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:07,200
sorry hey olr crew so i hate to be the guy that sends you yet another silly youtube link okay

1330
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:12,720
rob get ready to pull it up but i found this to be worthy of a quick watch maybe my sense of humor

1331
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:17,600
is completely sick and perverse but i'll be damned if the kids in skyrim aren't annoying

1332
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:22,880
little bastards every now and then this just proves every now and then every is this another

1333
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:27,440
goddamn arrow to the knee clip i don't know this just proves i'm not alone i think loki in

1334
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:31,680
particular will get a kick out of this okay i'm linking it to hold on i got it i got it is it from

1335
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:36,960

1339
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,360
real clip

1340
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:14,080

1341
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:30,720
i just killed a little friend here look at this oh my god that's terrible that's awesome

1342
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:35,920
i've seen this video before run away from me he just i didn't even know you could decapitate

1343
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:42,720
people ah you rush the dragon i stay i kind of want to go back and play skyrim again and

1344
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:51,600
just kill everybody be careful agony i keep hands on the ground wow yes sorry in all seriousness

1345
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:57,200
though i'm a huge fan of the show and have been listening for over six years i listen on and off

1346
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:01,760
throughout the week while working and you three managed to put a smile on my face no matter what

1347
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:08,880
the topic is even if we talk about child killing unicorn stabbing decapitating their mothers face

1348
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:15,760
melting yes i wanted to ask you how you have kept the show going on for so many years alcohol

1349
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:24,480
i have known countless groups bands organizations etc that start off strong but lose steam and

1350
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:29,680
eventually die due to apathy how do you guys manage to push through and deliver week after

1351
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:36,400
week after week after a whopping nine years what keeps you motivated and do you guys ever have

1352
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,840
major disagreements or even fights regarding direction no never you want to see the show go

1353
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:47,440
in the future just want to see behind the scenes gossip for a rabid olr fanboy take care and happy

1354
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:56,720
holidays tonic vision um first of all i'm never the same person every day so it's because of my

1355
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:02,400
innate womanness that i will change personality all the time you never know which pokemon she's

1356
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:09,200
carrying around um robin i go to disneyland that helps i i don't know that's i i i honestly don't

1357
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:13,840
know how we've managed to do this for nine years but you know we we we had a pretty good skit it's

1358
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:18,560
funny you're asking this now because we had a pretty good scare this past week that it might

1359
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:22,800
end very suddenly there there was a realistic possibility for a minute there that this could

1360
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:27,280
have been the last i was still gonna try the skype thing no wouldn't have been the last or a lot i

1361
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:34,480
know i know i know but the last olr as we know it you know and i i have my issues with the skype

1362
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:39,520
thing i know horde house kind of does it but you know just this show is good enough for horde house

1363
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:45,120
this show has worked because we haven't changed a lot since the first day and i think are you

1364
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:52,240
shitting me we've changed quite a bit but we've had nine fucking years to change we've evolved

1365
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:57,520
yes evolution we've evolved into raichu at some point along the way but no really i mean you know

1366
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:03,840
i thought we were jolting on we slowly evolved into the whole uh um you know general video

1367
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:08,240
gaming when we used to be about ddr and it was a lot more i found that the show had absolutely

1368
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:12,880
no fucking structure back in the day like if you listen if you listen to early episodes migraine

1369
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,680
the first episode and was like asleep in that chair if you listen to the first few episodes

1370
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:20,720
we really would just be like we're just gonna kind of like fuck off for three hours and talk

1371
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:26,480
about topics because you know to as much as i hate inflating travis's ego on this show

1372
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:30,880
that's kind of how i learned to do it on understation live is we kind of like had that

1373
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,200
same approach or it was like well we know we're going to talk about xyz tonight and somehow we'll

1374
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:40,000
do a show and it it were i'm not knocking travis at all he does a beautiful show and that's iron

1375
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,960
finger yeah that's that's how i was raised so to speak but at some point along the way when we made

1376
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:53,840
the switch into podcasting like i think suddenly when we took a different approach in making the

1377
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:59,840
to-go edition and then suddenly it was like okay we've gone from having 50 people listen live

1378
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:06,560
to having 2500 people downloading our podcast it was like shit something's working over here maybe

1379
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:11,520
we should like try mixing it up a little bit and it's it's kind of worked having the structure

1380
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,800
hasn't been such a bad thing but yes there's structure but there's still huge amounts of

1381
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:21,040
spontaneity yeah and a lot of that is directed by you guys in the chat room and i hate to sound

1382
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:27,360
mushy yucky frilly fuzzy but it's my foot in the trash the chatters to a big extent and our live

1383
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:34,880
audience and the interaction that we do get on the show me is sure is hugely motivating i mean

1384
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:40,640
for real like i i will be flat out dead honest there was i can think of one night in particular

1385
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:45,600
when i was ready to walk in here and say i'm quit i'm done i can't do this show anymore one dude

1386
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:52,080
but well no that was a different time but there was another time where i i just and i couldn't

1387
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:56,560
even tell you exactly when it was it was a long it was a long time ago it was it was during the

1388
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:02,240
garage years i remember that and um it was like one of the see it was probably around that same

1389
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:06,160
time when remember the computer went down yeah mid show and i had the big diva fit i think not

1390
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:13,360
long after that i was ready to just fucking quit and within a short time of each other we had the

1391
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:19,680
listeners chip together to buy a new computer and i got not one but like two emails that were very

1392
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:25,520
kind of personal in nature about like you know just what i've kind of put out there on the

1393
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,200
internet being like kind of open about the fact that i'm gay and you know in a relationship and

1394
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:33,200
all that stuff and and that it kind of gave some people that were struggling with coming out

1395
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:38,160
like hope and that like means like so much like i was just like floored and i was kind of like

1396
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:44,160
i fucking can't leave yeah i'm in this too deep now that they keep bribing us with food

1397
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:51,920
and games and happy things inevitably it'll it'll have to end someday nothing good lasts forever but

1398
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:58,800
what else am i going to do on sunday nights i i'm serious about lots of alcohol no i'm

1399
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:04,800
kidding it's it's seriously become like a part of my life like it's it's it's my routine like

1400
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,800
the nights that we don't have olr for whatever reason i'm sitting there at home sunday night

1401
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:13,200
going this feels weird you know what to know what most of the time we still end up hanging out

1402
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:18,400
anyway we have a lot of the times we get a pink berry we're like hey we don't have this show

1403
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:24,160
tonight let's go get pink berry and then we talk about the show literally the last time the last

1404
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,040
time we didn't have a show that's exactly what happened was that the night the internet kept us

1405
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:32,000
from doing a show yeah so i was like and we went to breakfast that day because dan was watching

1406
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:38,800
a stupid football so we're like let's go get pink berry later okay who's to show up no stupid

1407
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:43,680
which was funny because not 15 minutes after we decided to call it my internet came back up

1408
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:51,280
although it did end up going back down an hour later so i was like what the hell but we went

1409
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:59,520
ahead pink berry and talked about the show we talked about 10 year stuff yeah which by the way

1410
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,400
you need to work on that girly as soon as you get past all the other stuff one thing at a time i

1411
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:09,520
know i know but seriously we i i i need to talk to you offline about something because i don't want

1412
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,920
to say anything on air but you need to work on that because people are making travel plans

1413
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,240
because i kind of let it slip to somebody like there might be something happening at such and

1414
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:24,400
such place at such a such time really i'm booking my ticket right now shit now it has to happen

1415
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:31,040
well because i can't let this person down yeah well it's it's gonna be a busy couple of months

1416
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:37,440
because also a mutual friend of ours is graduating fun in may all right so go to their graduation say

1417
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:43,680
have fun in the real world bye and then get back on planning the 10-year party oh yeah all right

1418
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:48,960
i guess that's kind of a big deal that's a big deal all right so um but you know i also think

1419
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:56,480
that part of it too is that just with how crazy like i know i lost my job but you guys know how

1420
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:04,320
miserable i was before you know having the show gave me something to mark my weeks because

1421
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:14,160
i really was just like what am i doing oh yeah i have the show and it really kept my my level

1422
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:19,440
of consciousness of what was going on around me up instead of just falling into i'm depressed

1423
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:28,880
um a lot of stuff that's like for instance um i got to go to e3 like five times you know i don't

1454
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,360
things like i want to say like the whole unloud stuff that came up last week like jamie getting

1455
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:24,560
to do that design thing and me getting to try the on-camera thing and and in some ways succeeding in

1456
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:29,040
some ways falling on my face that would have not happened if it weren't for the show i mean i

1457
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:33,600
probably would have met seg anyway because he's a he's a friend of somebody i knew from college but

1458
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:38,880
it would have never but he's such a sweet person it would have never come to that without this show

1459
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:44,000
you know he's so nice and i was more than happy to do the work and which by the way guys you'll

1463
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:05,840
my group project and do it early so that was that was cool he was like that's a big event you go to

1464
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:12,400
that that's a big thing to you and also one thing i have to say that i've learned a lot of skills

1465
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:20,000
doing the show you know definitely definite communication and a big lesson that i learned

1466
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:28,000
is the the skill of no one cur seriously like remember that first like couple years and get

1467
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:33,680
you see she's go back in in the kitchen and i'm like oh yeah the itunes reviews that said like

1468
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:37,520
you know dark soccer needs to shut up and get back in the kitchen yeah i remember that one you're a

1469

1470
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:50,880

1491
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:13,040
adjust that or for some reason having a clear way to quit online without resetting the game that's

to make their wishes come true so we'll work on it all right fine i will help you tech out the

1502
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,800
new studio all right uh let's go back into some gaming news so we can get some calls here in a

1503
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:27,360
minute uh loki i like that darth spazinator says if looking go one show without hacking something

1504
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:33,600
or ranting someone should check to see if he has a fever or something yeah i'm in hack mode all the

1505
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:43,520
time all the time he's hacking your life as we speak uh you mad okay so capcom is releasing a

1506
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:51,040
capcom digital collection it includes a bunch of um you know xbox live arcade games basically it's

1507
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:58,400
coming out for 40 bucks and it includes 1942 joint strike by commando re-armed two uh final fight

1508
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:06,640
double impact flock rocket man axis of evil and also with the dlc it came from uranus and uh

1509
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:14,240
super puzzle fighter 2 turbo hd remix super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix and wolf

1510
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:24,480
of the battlefield commando 3 um all those available for 40 bucks um now correct me if

1511
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:30,640
i'm wrong but i thought that one of those games at the very least i believe final fight double

1512
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:36,640
impact required you be to be connected to xbox live in order to play it on register you know

1513
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:41,360
registered because i think that was playstation network that was playstation network they didn't

1514
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:47,120
have that i think it's been a while maybe this is where chat can help us out maybe i can't remember

1515
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:52,080
but i thought that would be interesting if you know if it required you to play online that'd

1516
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:56,880
be interesting well maybe they changed that yeah maybe but anyways it's about 100 bucks worth of

1517
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:04,240
games for 40 bucks so good deal i guess if you don't already have them so i have at least a few

1518
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:11,920
of those awesome all right well uh we were talking a little bit ago about e3 and uh this kind of goes

1519
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,480
with that and kind of part of the reason why i joke yeah i probably won't be going to e3 anymore

1520
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:23,840
unless loki helps a brother out but um e3 passes have doubled in cost and i know what you might be

1521
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,440
thinking you might be like wait a minute you don't pay to go to e3 doesn't everybody go to e3 for

1522
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:32,320
free like you register and you prove you're in the industry well yes for the most part most

1523
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:37,360
everybody you see at e3 got in there for free because either they are tied into the industry

1524
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,600
they um are in the media as a lot of the people obviously they are in kind of like the

1525
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,600
not just the gaming uh the people that make the games so the people like purchase the games like

1526
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:51,600
loki's industry distributors and all those people retail a lot of the folks that go but you also get

1527
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:58,240
sometimes people that want to go because they're exploring getting into the business or students

1528
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:02,560
or you know people that are kind of like exploring what type of business possible business ventures

1529
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:10,080
they can make and this is why e3 sells expo passes so to believe it or not this whole time you could

1530
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:16,400
really pay to go to e3 you could just say i'm exploring the industry or i'm a student wanting

1531
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:22,640
to kind of get into this or whatever and you can pay and the prices used to be uh let's see it was

1532
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:28,880
400 was last year's price if you registered before a certain date and 500 if you registered at the

1533
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:35,680
door for three days you know it's expensive or you can say i'm sin bad or you could say you're sin

1534
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:42,640
bad i got nothing to do today however the news is this year those prices have shot way up they've

1535
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:47,760
doubled now it doesn't sound like they've doubled but they've doubled they multiply them by two and

1536
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:53,680
then subtract five seven hundred and ninety five dollars before the deadline for a three-day pass

1537
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:58,880
nine hundred and ninety five dollars you might as well say a thousand dollars for a pass to get into

1538
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:05,840
e3 after april 23rd um so i mean that kind of sucks for people who want to explore like

1539
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:11,680
i i'm not i'm trying to figure out why e3 is doing this my thought is they're trying to maybe

1540
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:17,040
cut back on the people because there's some you know blogs and things have joked about this is

1541
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:22,240
that well you're paying all this money to wait in line and i i have to agree like i didn't well

1542
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:28,800
we didn't we didn't go to e3 last year remember that dark sakura we went to e3 we went into the

1543
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:33,440
lobby yeah we hung out and like we got freebies from the lobby people were kind of looking at us

1544
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:38,320
like where's their badges but we didn't go in into e3 itself but we were in the convention center

1545
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:42,240
kind of between the two halls and i held a ds street pass with people so we're just kind of

1546
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:47,760
like hanging out between and honestly i don't feel like i missed much i mean yeah there were

1547
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:53,920
some big announcements didn't you get a wiimoto no i didn't get me a moto i think uh me or shane did

1548
02:19:54,960 --> 02:20:01,760
so he he got the me somebody did maybe bobby did but yeah i don't think it's worth that

1549
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:07,840
much money to go stand around and wait in line i mean it would it would kind of like you know

1550
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:10,960
i don't know it would suck if you've gone all these years and then suddenly you can't go anymore

1551
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:16,320
like i know bobby's probably doing a lot of like how am i going to get an e3 this time because

1552
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:20,400
unfortunately the media standards they do this weird measurement where they're measuring your

1553
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:25,760
website traffic well if you're a show like us they're looking for so many hundred visits a month

1554
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:30,160
which we would hit easy on subscriptions we would easily hit i'm sorry they're looking for like

1555
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:33,760
thousand but we would still hit that on subscriptions because with four shows a month

1556
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,800
and everything we would hit that number on the subscriptions that people download our podcast

1557
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,320
but that's not how they measure it because they're looking at who's visiting the website

1558
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:44,320
and because our website doesn't really have a lot of cutting edge content on it

1559
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:46,560
i mean well what if our website was the rss feed

1560
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:53,680
i that might i don't know if it would work or not we'll see unfortunately the website

1561
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:59,200
fuck-ups last month might damage that and i don't know but i don't know it's whatever arbitrary

1562
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:04,400
scale they want to use and i i get what they're trying to do like it was so easy for somebody to

1563
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:09,600
just start their own website and get 20 of their friends in e3 under that website i feel like they

1564
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:14,080
did have to draw the line somewhere but i think they drew it too far out that us indie people

1565
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:23,840
kind of get fucked you know anyway i say that we uh do a commando entrance and say that we're

1566
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:30,480
worth modern warfare all right so good luck getting into e3 if you don't belong to a website

1567
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:36,800
that gets so many thousand hits a month anyhow moving on happier news dark sakura maybe not

1568
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:46,480
vita we've got vita mens um no actually not really um what is going on with the vita they

1569
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:51,440
are actually getting rid of the instruction booklet guess what apple did it first mean or

1570
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:58,880
neener um they're actually having digital manuals that you can access in game for each of the games

1571
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:07,440
so um it puts people like me out of the job that like printing um but you can still design online

1572
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:13,920
stuff uh yeah i could still still do pdfs and everything i mean that's not a big deal but

1573
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:20,320
they're basically going to be um doing in-game manuals well it's still kind of yucky though i

1574
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:24,720
mean i i don't know i'm i'm torn because it's like how many times do i really read the instruction

1575
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:28,160
manual well it makes sense because they're already creating them anyways because they're offering all

1576
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:33,360
their games digitally as well as at retail so if they're already creating those digital things why

1577
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:38,880
make them printed but then i think about back in the nes days like the manual to the legend of

1578
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:43,440
zelda that kind of like told the story in the first few pages so that was awesome i miss that

1579
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:48,400
kind of shit but i i get it like now i don't i don't really bother reading manuals i mean look

1580
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:53,760
at skyrim skyrim came in with a foldout map that it's made to look like parchment and shit hmm i

1581
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,960
mean they still would do that kind of stuff like i remember like my copy of grandia that had a cloth

1582
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:07,920
map you know they still do amazing manuals and stuff in japan here not so much even in the old

1583
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:16,160
days wow so i think it's just i mean i understand yeah it'll save some money but in the end it

1584
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:21,360
really detracts from the product i think but then again apple did that when they released the iphone

1585
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:27,760
no instruction manual remember that's true it just had a how to hook it up all in their bookstore now

1586
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:32,400
you can get a full manual in the bookstore but you don't need it yeah there's a video of a

1587
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:40,240
three-year-old using one sending text messages but i'm just i'm just saying you know it's not a new

1588
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:46,000
thing cloud cleveland in our chat room says gotta save those trees you know what for every tree

1589
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:51,040
that's cut down in the united states three more are planted i think i i i have a feeling it's a

1590
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:58,560
little bit tongue in cheek that comment i know but i it's not an excuse i it's it's a cost saving

1591
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:03,280
measure is what it is that's what it is let's let's be real it's a cost saving measure it costs

1592
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:06,880
money to print those books and they decided they could save money on getting the game out there by

1593
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:12,400
just getting rid of the books and putting it's true i mean i i understand and i agree but i mean

1594
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:20,320
it's putting a whole but it's it's the end of an industry of printing it's sad yeah but of course

1595
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:25,600
well if you think about it though jamie i hate to say it but a lot of printing industry is going

1596
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:31,920
digital i mean look at i love the smell of ink i know but and i think there will still always be

1597
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:36,960
demand for things like movie posters advertising still big and all that but like look at things

1598
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:43,680
like you know the new york times is on the freaking ipad now and that's how people get it

1599
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:47,440
but you know what i think that the whole thing about the print industry in and of itself is

1600
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:54,000
turning more into a specialty market because there are now a there's a resurgence of um quality

1601
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,080
magazines if you know what i mean that are like artsy magazines that are like nice thick paper

1602
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:07,200
and done in a certain size those and they charge quite a bit for them but they know their market

1603
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:13,360
they're the people who are print files and or look at look at look at the stuff you had to do

1604
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:16,640
for umlaut there's a lot of like design shit that people don't even think about like somebody made

1605
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:20,320
the badges somebody made the photo background somebody made the you know uh flyers somebody

1606
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:25,040
made you know there's a lot of stuff i did the digital ones too you know so i mean

1607
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,480
as see that's why well there's also people who need to design game covers

1608
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:35,440
that's true do you need to do the layout on the back that will never go away that's not gonna go

1609
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:40,640
away that's why i get really irritated when people buy a nice expensive box set and then they just

1610
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:44,880
throw the boxes away it's like do you realize that someone put work into that just think of

1611
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,760
some of the great covers we've had in gaming like the original mega man cover

1612
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:54,400
well well here's an example for you remember rolling stone used to do the top 100 album

1613
02:25:54,400 --> 02:26:01,120
covers of all time do we have that anymore do they still do this well of all time no because

1614
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:06,800
they already made it well i know what you mean though once you have to be somebody like lady

1615
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:11,600
gaga for people to get excited about your cover because you're doing something like like the

1616
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:18,320
bitch is a bike what yeah but i mean it's it's really that i think that people are really stopping

1617
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:24,640
are taking their design for granted they're so used to seeing something that's well done and

1618
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:30,480
clean now as opposed to the shit we had in the 80s that it's all being taken for granted and

1619
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:35,920
then you have to think about you know like the manuals all of that is somebody someone's got

1620
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:41,200
to design that you know and yeah it's cool to have it you know digital because then you can have it

1621
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:48,880
in color you have to pray you know pray please pay for four color process which is expensive

1622
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:55,920
but at the same time you know i think it's it's really sad it does take something out of

1623
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:03,040
an entire industry all right i know that's i would be the only one in this house that would go off on

1624
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:07,360
that all right just a couple more stories for you guys i like the smell of ink shut up and then

1625
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:12,240
we're going to get to the skype line at 1877 game olr and the twitter at twitter.com slash

1626
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:21,360
olr but first loki yes um so let's talk a little bit about um my favorite discussion topic

1627
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:32,320
skylanders and i said before you know you guys are only encouraging them i mean if

1628
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:38,160
anyways so activision they're taking skylanders a little bit further they're branching out onto

1629
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:43,760
into an online world if you will with skylanders universe and what skylanders universe is going to

1630
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:50,960
be it's basically like um the free realms thing that they have for sony online it's basically a

1631
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:58,400
world where you can go purchase a piece of the virtual skyland and customize it however you want

1632
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:03,360
along with a skylander character and i guess it's filled a bunch of different little mini games and

1633
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:11,120
stuff like that and they're gonna have constant updates to go along with it as well um no word on

1634
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:17,520
integration though with the actual characters although i would i would imagine that they're

1635
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:25,440
going to have something like that or you know i see a button that says rental so obviously they're

1636
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:32,480
charging for something but um i mean seriously guys just i hear so many people going wow you know

1637
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:39,040
this is like i've always wished for something to interact with you know my games and stuff they

1638
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:45,360
come with these you buy these toys okay they're little figures they don't do anything at all and

1639
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:52,960
i mean if call of duty were to come out with some little green plastic army men that did nothing and

1640
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:58,800
they would charge eight dollars for you know each dlc character people will find the repo fuck marvel

1641
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:05,920
versus capcom 3 when they were charging six dollars per character for dlc people bitched like

1642
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:11,920
crazy saying what the fuck you expect me to pay six dollars for a fucking character that was on

1643
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:17,680
disk hey you're paying eight dollars for a character that's on disk with you know skylanders

1644
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:25,760
and guess what you keep buying them so they're gonna keep releasing them so i have you guys to

1645
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:30,320
thank for that thank you people that got all fucking nostalgic about it because guess what

1646
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:35,360
when next call duty comes out you're gonna be fucking paying eight dollars for whatever a gun

1647
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:42,640
you're gonna get a little plastic gun i sense you're really upset about something it's just

1648
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:47,760
annoying it's just like people complain about the prices of why are they charging so much why is

1649
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:54,080
there so much dlc for for these games why am i not like getting only half a game at the buy the rest

1650
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:58,400
in dlc it's because you're willing to pay eight dollars for a fucking plastic figurine that does

1651
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:05,040
nothing to play as a character in a game and not only will you buy one but you'll buy tons of them

1652
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:10,720
that's why they keep selling you fucking dlc for your games because you're a fucking sucker that's

1653
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:15,920
why you will buy whatever the company puts out even if it's for a franchise that's brand new

1654
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:22,880
that's pretty much nothing to do with spiro at all zero there's a character that resembles

1655
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:28,000
spiro it's not really spiro anymore and then a bunch of other tertiary characters that really

1656
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,760
take the forefront and that's it i love salacious pop's comment in chat room if it didn't cost like

1657
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:38,800
380 to do it it would be awesome to hold an olr drive to surprise loki's tyke with a fluke

1676
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:41,760
mms was doing this i remember bobby was talking on his show because he he's dabbled in eve online

1677
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:46,800
i think or he knows people that are playing it and um they had the whole monocle thing that was

1678
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:52,000
being sold for like 60 bucks like it's just but some people in order to really stand out in a

1679
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,680
crowd and have the biggest epine will pay that money i mean think about it why was there so much

1680
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:03,520
internet rage about people getting into that star wars the old republic game different times this

1681
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:08,400
week people were pissed that they weren't first that they couldn't have the first level 50

1682
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:13,440
character although let's be real nobody that was complaining about it is going to be the one to

1683
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:17,760
have that first level 50 character you know the person that has the first level 50 character

1684
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:24,240
is probably a group of people that are pushing their way to it you know just just to have the

1685
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:31,360
biggest pain you know what i mean yeah like people will do pay anything to get ahead and have the

1686
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:40,320
biggest pain yeah and i'm sure that thing sold quite a few cars probably not a ton but enough

1687
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:48,160
to make ea probably do it again we're just sad remember that app that when you know the iphone

1688
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:54,160
first came about and they had an app that was like five thousand dollars or some shit for

1689
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:58,560
sparkling diamond thing that spun around and that's all it did yeah people bought that shit

1690
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:06,400
too because they're dumb and and i'd like to point out once again how stupid skylinders is

1691
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:10,960
take a look at this picture of spiro from skylanders he looks like he got fucking kicked

1692
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:16,560

1718
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:39,440
do what take a nap shush did you just call in to troll loki tonight uh yes but uh i do have other

1719
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:44,560
things i can comment on okay everything yeah yeah tell us about the e3 thing you've been e3 eight

1720
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:49,440
eight how many freaking years in a row 18 years in a row or something crazy 15 years 15 years in a

1721
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:57,120
row and i paid 75 to get the exhibits only pass in 97 my first year oh my gosh and so now it's

1722
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:04,880
five dollars for the three-day expo pass wow it's got it it always has gone up and like 400 was a

1723
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:09,360
big jump because i think the last time i had paid i was like it was still like 150 or so

1724
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:16,080
it's a 200 and but what i think is going on is that they're really trying to keep people like me

1725
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:22,720
out because i've you know about half of my e3s have been free either through the media or through

1726
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:27,360
my industry or through software development credentials or whatever um and the other half

1727
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:32,240
have been free and i always had that to kind of fall back on and what they're i'm gonna kind of

1728
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:36,720
equate it to something that's uh i don't know if they've got these type of toll roads out in

1729
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:42,240
california but they just opened one in georgia where they increase the price to dissuade people

1730
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:48,720
from using that lane on the road there's one lane it's an hov pass they just started those in the

1731
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:53,440
bay area the whole fast track carpool lane where it's like you yeah depending on how many cars are

1732
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:57,760
in it the price goes up during certain times of the day yeah yeah yeah so i think e3 is trying

1733
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:02,560
to do the same thing they're like well if these bloggers that really shouldn't that we don't feel

1734
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:07,040
have a right to be here are willing to pay the 400 let's see if they're willing to pay the 800

1735
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:14,000
and there are there is probably people that will say no that's too much and uh you know if they're

1736
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,160
not a legitimate business they can't write it off as a business expense or anything like that

1737
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:22,240
so what they're trying to do is they're trying to limit the amount of people that they don't think

1738
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:27,200
should be at e3 from still getting into e3 because that's been the dirty little secret is as long as

1739
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:34,800
you're over 18 you could pay and it didn't matter what your job was wow and you know you it didn't

1740
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:39,200
matter what you did if you gave them the money they gave you a pass and said have fun all right

1741
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:43,600
just it just it just kind of stinks that some of us who you know have been trying so hard for so

1742
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:48,240
long kind of you know get the shaft and you know there's some there's some people that do get those

1743
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:52,480
numbers that kind of look down on the rest of us and say well just try harder but it's kind of like

1744
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:58,960
well it's it's it's tougher when they don't get what we're doing and that i'm not here to create

1745
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:04,160
a website you know what i mean right and they don't mind because they've got enough people

1746
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:09,040
doing coverage that do have websites yeah and a lot of podcasting networks someone like you know

1747
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:14,560
all games gets passes you know they've got enough and you know some other podcasting networks

1748
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:20,000
basically they just pool all together but the individual shows themselves don't exactly have

1749
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,480
the website visitors unless they've got a vibrant community that they've built up right and

1750
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:30,800
unfortunately you know just our situation is kind of unique with the chat room and the the live

1751
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:35,680
streaming and then the podcast and stuff and there's just they don't want to deal with it

1752
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:41,120
you know they already feel they allow too many media in and so they're not going to change

1753
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,200
anything they do so i'm not even going to bother with the media pass this year i'm but see what

1754
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:50,320
they've done to me is the way i got in last year was through my day job because i'm a software

1755
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:56,400
developer and yes we actually do work on ios stuff and i have done gaming you know gaming

1756
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:01,600
exploratory stuff with my day job so technically i'm a game developer right and that's usually

1757
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:07,600
good enough well apparently they've kind of updated their industry rule and now they actually

1758
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:12,800
check your company's website to see if you publicly have ties to the gaming industry wow

1759
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:16,800
and since we don't have any completed projects our website just talks about the real estate

1760
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:22,080
websites which is our main revenue it says nothing about the gaming so if i i'm afraid

1761
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:27,200
if i i mean i'm still going to try to apply and send my w2 and the tax id and all the stuff that

1762
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:31,760
i need that i was eligible with last year i'm going to send it in and but they may look at the

1763
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:37,920
website and say you're not in the gaming industry wow it's like they're paying all these people to

1764
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:41,840
investigate who's going i mean i i kind of get that something's got to give because the

1765
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:47,120
show has a lot of people there but at the same time there are a lot of people that shouldn't be

1766
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:53,600
there right but in order to keep them out they also have to get some of the people that probably

1767
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:57,760
do have more acclaim because a lot of the companies there do believe i should be there

1768
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:03,600
but it's not up to them who gets invited to e3 it was at one point yes and i got in those years

1769
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:10,880
yeah yeah funny enough my first e3 was thanks to friends of konami yeah so it's it's in fact

1770
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:15,040
dark soccer could say the same thing i think and for a couple years was kind of that went into ddr

1771
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:18,880
because well because we were all while doing ddr oriented stuff and you know konami was really

1772
02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:22,880
pushing those games when they came out those years so they definitely wanted to see us there

1773
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:26,960
but it's um you know and uh we were there the year beatmania launched in america and obviously

1774
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:31,600
they knew that that would be a big thing we you know we tried to get the word out but unfortunately

1775
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:37,360
uh just wasn't it's time so so i mean and that's what it is and i'm not going to sit here and qq

1776
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:42,160
over you know not getting in to go to go to e3 or something or it being a little bit too expensive

1777
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:47,840
or something um you know but it but it does you know from a personal level it does kind of suck

1778
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:52,560
because i've gone every year right right it kind of sucks and there are people that i see there

1779
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:57,760
that i only see once a year and to me e3 is more about the people and not the games i actually

1780
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:03,200
talk to more people and network more than i actually play games unless it was 2007 when only

1781
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:07,440
like two thousand three thousand people were there and i actually played a lot more games what's

1782
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:14,240
gonna happen to our disney trip i don't know i'm sad remember we went to we went to we went to

1783
02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:19,920
disneyland with bobby this year at e3 that's why we went to e3 we went to pick bobby up i wanted

1784
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:23,920
that to become a new tradition maybe i'll just have to like book a ticket out to uh sacramento

1785
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:27,920
sometime we'll just or we'll just go hang in the convention center take you to fairy tale town

1786
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:31,440
i need to i need to actually clue you in on what's going on for the 10th anniversary or what we're

1787
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:35,040
trying to plan because i just realized i haven't told you yet so it'll be awesome if you can make

1788
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:41,200
an appearance but if not totally understand it's expensive so all right actually actually the the

1789
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:46,880
only expensive part would be uh like a hotel room but if i didn't need one of those we can work

1790
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:53,200
something out it's good it's gonna be somewhat local i i really have to watch my mouth because

1791
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:59,600
nothing has been sealed yet but jamie's gonna work on that real soon when she's done what's

1792
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:05,120
worrying her now see i know i know i'm on your side jamie in the new year thank you bobby all

1793

1799
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:40,960
it like an npr style show because it's just him talking about games but you know you can hear his

1800
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:45,680
voice when he talks to us there he has a great radio voice and you know he really kind of thinks

1801
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:49,920
about the topics he's going to talk about and so he's kind of able to sustain the show himself

1802
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:54,000
and then yet interact with the chatters he kind of does like part one and part two and in part one

1803
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,120
it's him and in part two it's the chatters and uh he does a great job so definitely listen to the

1804
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:05,200
show and we're happy to be on the same night same network as him let's go to the phones and take

1808
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:30,720
thank you for staying up late listening to us good heavens well what did you call in to talk

1809
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:36,640
about tonight there's a there's a couple of things uh your really big bundle is actually the indie

1810
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:43,760
royale and they have the xmas bundle up now which includes the black world trilogy remastered eats

1811
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:49,920
dino d-day and the oil blue just in case you're interested also going back a little bit about your

1812
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:56,480
about the peripheral for the 3ds nintendo have been doing this for years remember the n64

1813
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:05,520
they had the memory expansion slot which also you needed for uh zelda uh oh god the horrible one

1814
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:14,640
the horse mask yes the nintendo have been doing this for a long time that's true nintendo always

1815
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:18,560
just kind of put out these extra little things and then suddenly the game requires it later on that's

1816
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:23,840
that's very true nothing new for nintendo they did the same thing with the um uh uh what the

1817
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:28,880
hell was i talking about earlier the um we we with the we motion plus did the gamecube do anything

1818
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:31,520
like that i don't think the gamecube did i think that's the one system that kind of stayed

1819
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:36,240
consistent i don't remember i remember they had those wave birds were awesome the wireless

1820
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:42,080
controllers but that was that's all i can think of there it just seems every generation they tried

1821
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:47,600
to do one thing they did they had the game boy advance cable but there were so few games didn't

1822
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:53,040
they have like a network thing yeah fantasy star online used it that's it uh maybe one other game

1823
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:57,520
mario kart land that was a that was a the warp pipe or whatever it was called that was a terrible

1824
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:02,720
terrible thing nintendo did putting that out there and then just never using it so you know

1825
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:06,960
i catastrophic maggie since you're calling him from the uk i've got to say it it's you must kind

1826
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:12,320
of laugh when we bitch about how we're having to wait all this time for xenoblade to come out over

1827
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:18,640
here because nintendo's been fucking over you guys for years with her releases huh that's one of the

1828
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:23,280
weirdest things who'd have thought nintendo would ever release a game here first except you know

1829
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:29,520
maybe tingle tingle rpg we never i don't think we ever did get that tingle rpg no we didn't i don't

1830
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:36,960
think so that's sad it's tragic loki had it pre-ordered and everything oh yeah totally uh no

1831
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:42,960
did he have his pre-order for his costume as well at the same time i i wish i wish yeah and

1832
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:47,040
unfortunately they cancelled that too i'm sorry shame shame

1833
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:53,600
shame talking about that though the funny thing is you're talking about manuals

1834
02:46:54,720 --> 02:47:00,160
uh in the uk though i mean you said japan japan gets better manuals than you but in the uk most

1835
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:06,640
of our manuals have always been black and white even when um you get nice color manuals we just

1836
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:11,760
get cheap black and white ones you get the seven cent copies from kinkos whereas we're having to

1837
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:17,120
deal with the the uh or as we get the color ones that's that's great man you guys been getting the

1838
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:22,080
shaft on your releases for years why is that why do you guys have to wait and then you don't even

1839
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:27,760
get the nice manuals the probable reason is because europe has a lot of languages

1840
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:36,720
that's true we get we usually get really thick manuals with 10 different languages also in it

1841
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:43,280
well few pages for english french german blah blah blah you know what's interesting even here now all

1842
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:49,040
the nintendo games usually have their manuals in three languages uh english french and spanish and

1843
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:54,000
i'm assuming that's because they they do a lot of big north american region launches so they have

1844
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:59,040
french for the canadians and spanish for the mexicans but it's just interesting just trying

1845
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:05,680
to save money i guess i guess um one last question sure i remember a few years ago you were going to

1846
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:11,840
do a euro a europe show and it got cancelled at the last second it did and we ended up starting

1847
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:17,840
the marathon show we did a couple months later at noon are you ever going to do another are you ever

1848
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:22,640
going to plan another europe show i'm sure this late is not good for my health i'm i'm i think

1849
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:27,440
we're gonna have to at at our friend's request we're gonna have to do another uk show so we need

1850
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:33,760
to do another marathon shows i'd be absolutely thrilled to well um we did mention a little bit

1851
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:39,520
about maybe maybe we should do something earlier in the day on new year's eve may wait no we're

1852
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:43,040

1855
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:58,160

1873
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:55,920
okay uh we got a tweet from cloud cleveland that links us to a story on screwattack.com

1874
02:50:55,920 --> 02:51:01,440
that talks about game gadget system wants to be ipod gaming oh this is kind of neat it looks like

1875
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:08,400
somebody's changed like a typical ipod to put a little kind of like what looks like a little um

1876
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:14,400
i guess you could say a ds like the bottom half of a ds kind of turn it into one of those

1877
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:19,920
they call it an open source game system from the uk-based company game gadget and it's called the

1878
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:26,000
game gadget 1.0 the press release doesn't appear to say a lot but let's go to a quote from jason

1879
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:30,480
cooper who created the game gadget quote game gadget has been designed with the ultimate goal

1880
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:35,680
of playing every game on a single device just as the ipod was for music hundreds of thousands of

1881
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:40,800
games are currently archived and no longer being enjoyed by gamers with no value being generated

1882
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:44,960
for the developers and publishers the launch of game gadget creates a market for gamers to play

1883
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:49,280
the games that want to play uh that they want to play the game gadget game service just like

1884
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:54,000
apple's app store allows the owners of these games to remarket their back catalog in their original

1885
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,280
format set the appropriate pricing and gain incremental revenue but with no additional

1886
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:03,680
investment okay so i get it so it's not actually like an ipod it just kind of looks like one with

1887
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:07,680
its its plugins and stuff and they're just trying to build like an app store for games

1888
02:52:09,360 --> 02:52:15,360
um i it would be interesting to see if they get the buy-in because i don't know if they're going

1889
02:52:15,360 --> 02:52:24,480
to actually get the buy-in on that so all right um i need to reopen the skype line because i

1941
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:33,440
he can promote both all right quickly let's try to close out some of these tweets um

1942
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:40,240
i gotta say a couple tweets about the xbox live call earlier um people in the same situation this

1943
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:46,160
one from sj100 matt this story on olr just now scared me into changing my xbox live accounts

1944
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:51,280
password to email address to it change yours or you might get screwed i say up a good advice at

1945
02:57:51,280 --> 02:57:56,480
least you know you're going to be better off also from sj100 matt here's an ask orange launch radio

1946
02:57:56,480 --> 02:58:05,840
question which is better waffles pancakes or french toast rank them it depends on where they're

1947
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:11,600
from but i will take my favorites of all okay number one is the french toast at sam's kosher

1948
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:18,240
style deli you've had it i have it's epic number two are the banana cream uh waffles

1949
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:24,800
at um charlie's that's across the street from my neighborhood and number three um

1950
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:35,440
i guess i hop um pumpkin pancakes loki pancakes would definitely be dead last that's a toss-up

1951
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:42,240
between waffles and uh french toast because it depends where you go actually terrible or good

1952
02:58:42,240 --> 02:58:49,440
in its own category should be waffle house waffles just saying uh for me waffles are way up here

1953
02:58:49,440 --> 02:58:55,360
number one waffle waffle waffle way up high and then below that pancakes and french toast i gotta

1954
02:58:55,360 --> 02:59:01,120
i gotta rate french toast last i'm sorry don't get me wrong it's still good and i'll never pass on it

1955
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:05,040
unless i'm like not feeling well but remember the sweet potato pancakes that we got that didn't

1956
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:10,240
taste very sweet potato oh yeah maybe they have some sort of unholy turducken of like pancakes

1957
02:59:10,240 --> 02:59:16,560
waffles and french toast you know where you like take french toast and like the the monty cristo

1958
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:23,120
of breakfast food like yeah you like take french toast and you maybe like put some waffle batter

1959
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:31,840
with french toast made of challah and we stuff it with a crispy waffle filled with pancake i

1960
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:35,760
love salacious pops comment and chat what the fuck is this sophie's choice shit

1961
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:46,000
agree think how it feels for us uh stirlock says it's a tweet vita shuts out the blind

1962
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:51,360
you can't use the buttons in the menus therefore making the system completely unusable for us

1963
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:55,920
really i'm trying to think now see i haven't seen the vita or look at the interface at all

1964
02:59:55,920 --> 03:00:01,680
so i know i know he's talking about it looks like bubbles blind is it because since you can't use

1965
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:06,160
the tangible buttons and obviously a blind person can't see the touch screen or know where to touch

1966
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:10,080
yeah they're that's why they're screwed yep because you can't use tangible buttons well that's messed

1967
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:18,240
up sony needs to think about everybody hopefully in a patch i mean i have seen handicap accessibility

1968
03:00:18,240 --> 03:00:23,600
happen in patching not that that's gonna be a great answer for right now because that doesn't

1969
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:27,760
because that doesn't look good for the us launch but hey you know what we say buddy

1970
03:00:27,760 --> 03:00:32,880
vote with your wallet if you can't play it don't buy one alan is telling all about you

1971
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:40,960

1973
03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:51,040
know what i've been doing lately though is just screw the you know scrutiny sort of like utensils

1974
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:55,440
you just pour a stack of four waffles you pour syrup on the top a ton of syrup on top i don't

even like syrup oh i love syrup yeah enjoy my stuff man it's it's fucking good it's not that

1976
03:01:01,280 --> 03:01:06,480

1977
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:12,160
like all that stuff don't get me wrong but it's just you know i especially after i got sick a few

1978
03:01:12,160 --> 03:01:15,760
years ago i feel like i can have the taste of it without adding all that stuff but i'll tell you

1979
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:21,600

why we get along dan never uses a straw see when he is given a drink to go he takes off the lid and

2023
03:05:42,320 --> 03:05:47,920
the straw and drinks out of the cup amen dan you rock i however like straws for every damn thing
